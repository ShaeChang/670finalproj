# 607 Final Project

## China electricity industry reform: Insights with text analysis

## Overview
This is the final project of PPOL 670 at Georgetown University, taught by Aaron R. Williams. The authors of this assignment are Xiyu Zhang @ShaeChang & Jinli Wu @jw1935.

Our focus: 2 Questions, 2 Parts

1. To what extent, did the array of policy concepts brought up at 2015 still seems feasible and even successful? To what extent, on the contrary, these concepts were already abandoned and substituted by other new concepts?
2. Real social science analysis in Chinese context, given the technical threshold? 

## Description
Our repository include a README.md file, two .Rmd files, a .gitignore file and a folder \data including all the data and images needed.

## Instruction of replication
Run the corresponding .Rmd file in Rstudio with the data in \data folder to replicate the two works.
