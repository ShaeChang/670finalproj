1,A regulatory policy to promote renewable energy consumption in China: Review and future evolutionary path,"Renewable energy has become the world's strategic choice to solve environmental pollution, address the energy crisis and achieve social sustainable development. The establishment of a regulatory system coincides with the development stage of renewable energy and electricity market operation is significant in standardizing the market competition and guaranteeing healthy development of renewable energy in China. This paper analyses the current situation of renewable energy development and the existing renewable energy regulation system in China, pointing out that the main problems restricting renewable energy development are institutional mechanisms and market factors. The existing regulatory mechanisms also have deficiencies, such as the inclination towards economic regulation and the lack of a market adjustment mechanism. This paper proposes that China should comprehensively consider the renewable energy development stage, electricity market trading mechanisms and other factors in electricity regulatory requirements when policy making, actively exploring a new renewable energy regulation model adapted to different development phases. In addition, this paper suggests China's regulatory policy path based on the forecasting of renewable energy developing models.","Although China's rapid development of renewable energy has promoted power source structure optimization, the associated power regulatory laws and supporting measures are imperfect. To some extent, the existing regulation policies and mechanisms are inadequate for promoting the development of renewable energy. Therefore, it is necessary to study the electricity market regulation issue under the condition of large-scale renewable energy grid connection to improve China's regulatory policy system further.

In the early stage of renewable energy development, the study of renewable energy mainly focused on encouraging policies, such as ﬁnancial subsidies, tax deductions, technological support, etc. Researchers generally believe that breakthroughs in technology are the key to achieving rapid development, and the R&D (research and development) stage is the ﬁeld that needs increased government policy support. Hillring, Graham and Martine et al. demonstrated the important role of renewable energy technologies in the further development of the renewable energy industry, proposing that in the primary stage the government should promote renewable energy development via supporting technology research, encouraging information dissemination, introducing effective administrative policies, perfecting incentive mechanisms, etc. [1e3].

With the advance of policy and the maturity of the renewable energy market, research is turning to the links between renewable energy, low-carbon development, energy supply security and carbon tax. Scholars are expecting to introduce a packaged policy to achieve a sustainable low-carbon future. Kalkuhla et al. used a global general equilibrium model to study optimal policies from a broad set of policy instruments including carbon taxes, renewable energy subsidies, etc., and found that small deviations from the second-best subsidy could lead to strong increases in emissions and consumption losses. The conclusion included the assertion that renewable energy subsidies were highly efﬁcient when they addressed market failures directly related to renewable energy technologies or markets; meanwhile, it might be an important additional instrument to solve the serious political issues of carbon pricing [4]. Gawel et al. analysed the interaction of the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS) and supported policies for renewable energy sources (RESs). He suggested that support for renewable energies should contribute to a more effective ETS design and may even increase the overall efﬁciency of climate and energy policy if other externalities and policy objectives besides climate protection were considered. Besides, the analysis also showed that a public choice view did not necessarily entail negative evaluations concerning the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a policy mix [5]. Aslani et al. described the relationship between renewable energy encouraging policies, energy dependence and demands through the analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors [6].

The study of power industry regulation is a long-standing topic. Tye undertook an in-depth analysis of generation, transmission, distribution functions and organizational forms in the power industry. He believed that these functions were not inseparable under the circumstance of existing technologies and proposed that the power generation side should be deregulated and open to competition [7]. In addition, Hazam, Ritschel et al. and Kemezis studied the impacts on the electricity market caused by regulatory philosophy and changes in cognition. They predicted that the globalization trend in the power industry was deregulation [8e10]. Rose studied and analysed three main regulation models combined with the U.S. electricity market. He pointed out the characteristics of various regulation methods and demonstrated the deregulating trend of the electricity market. To some extent, his research provided a basis for the trend towards gradual liberalization of the power industry [11]. Nakajima studied the electricity retail market without strict regulation in the U.S., indicated that deregulation € was not a major factor in the price elasticity [12]. Hogselius et al. focused on the response behaviours of key stakeholders in political and commercial areas in the process of electricity industry deregulation [13].

Recently, with the in-depth study of power industry regulation, close attention has been paid to the study of renewable energy regulation, covering a variety of forms of energy power generation and relevant market players. Shaw et al. studied the relationship among UK energy policy, regulatory objectives and distribution network operator (DNO) regulation since privatization and suggested reform to the regulatory framework to support future lowercarbon development [14]. Geraldo et al. presented the main regulatory changes that had occurred in the Brazilian power sector, especially related to small hydro power. They proposed that a collective effort was necessary on behalf of everyone involved in the production chain and there was a need to deﬁne clear rules that were both perennial and non-discriminatory for the different sources of renewable energy to provide stability to the energy system and achieve the country's sustainable development [15]. Tükenmez et al. proposed that administrative hurdles, obstacles to grid access, lack of information and training and social acceptance were the barriers that Turkey needed to overcome to increase its renewable energy supply [16]. Byrnes et al. outlined the key policy frameworks, incentives and regulatory environment of the renewable energy sector in Australian, and presented an in-depth analysis of the barriers faced by the industry. They pointed out that measures should be taken to remove the obstacles to the development of renewable energy, otherwise Australia would miss the opportunity to develop its abundant renewable resources further and gain social, environmental and economic beneﬁts [17]. Agrell et al. analysed the main impacts of new investment policy on the power network construction tasks, assets and costs, and contrasted these with the assumptions of economic regulation. They also developed an analytical model of investment provision under regulation based on standard principal agency theory, and the results conﬁrmed the hypothesis that network regulation should ﬁnd a focal point, integrate externalities into the performance

assessment and avoid wide delegation of contracting billing for smart-grid investments [18]. Wijayatunga et al. found that the implementation of policy and regulatory frameworks and different approaches had been mostly successful experiences in Sri Lanka, resulting in rapid expansion of the renewable energy supply industry not only in terms of overall capacity additions but also in the form of diversiﬁcation of renewable energy sources [19]. Zhen-Yu Zhao et al. established a critical analysis of the policy framework for the renewable energy in China, meanwhile analysed its impacts on the power generation structure [20].

This research has certain signiﬁcance for renewable energy development and renewable energy regulation in China. However, China's electricity market is at a different stage from other countries' markets, and the development environment is very different too. In addition, in order to promote renewable energy development further, a policy system and regulation modes adapting to the electricity market and development stage should be proposed. Based on the research results, this paper undertakes in-depth research on China's renewable energy regulation and designs a regulation path for the future.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy introduces the current situation of renewable energy development and its strategic objectives in China and points out the main factors impeding the development of renewable energy. Section 3 elaborates the current regulatory policy system and mechanisms, which are related to renewable energy, and presents the problems in the existing regulatory system. Section 4 designs the dynamic regulatory policy path based on the prediction of China's electricity market operation mode and future development strategy for renewable energy. Section 5 concludes the paper with suggestions for renewable energy regulation policy.

In China, some energy conservation targets have been promoted by the Government: to decrease the carbon emissions' intensity by 17% during the ‘12th Five-Year’ period from 2011 to 2015, to decrease the carbon emissions' intensity by 40%e50% by 2020, and to reach the peak of the carbon dioxide emissions about 2030 [21,22].

China's renewable energy has achieved a great leap forward in development driven by the “Renewable Energy Law” and other related policies. To some extent, this has made a great contribution to achieving China's emission reduction targets. In 2014, the total power generation is about 5649.6 TWh. Renewable energy (hydro, wind and solar) power generation is 1251.8 TWh, accounting for 22.16% of the national power generation [23].

According to the statistical results of the National Energy Administration (NEA) and Statistical Bulletin of National Economic and Social Development of China in 2014, by 2014, China's total installed capacity of power generation reached 1.36 TW, the total hydro, wind power, and solar power installed capacity were 915.69 GW, 114.609 GW, 28.05 GW. Meanwhile, the new wind power installed capacity was 23.19 GW in 2014, which was raised

44.2% compared with last year. The new solar power installed capacity was 10.6 GW, including 8.55 GW of photovoltaic power station and 2.05 GW of Photovoltaic distributed power in 2014.

In addition, According to “National Climate Change Plan (2014e2020)” which was promulgated in November 4, 2014, wind power, solar energy, biomass power generation will obtain rapid growth. The details are shown in Table 1.

With the increase of energy demand, the next major factors driving towards installed capacity is renewable energy power. According to “the Power Industry ‘12th 5-year (2015e2020)’ Planning Research Report”, the China Electricity Council (CEC) puts forward recommendations about targets of renewable energy in 2020. The speciﬁc recommendations are that the national power installed capacity will reach around 1885 GW by the years 2020, and the average growth rate is about 5.6%. Meanwhile, the total installed capacity non-fossil energy power will be around 685 GW, which accounts for around 36.3% of total installed capacity [24]. According to “the Power Industry ‘12th 5-year (2015e2020)’ Planning Research Report”, China's power structure will be greatly improved, as shown in Fig. 1.

In the future, global investment in renewable energy and technology will usher in a period of high-speed development. According to ‘the Outlook of Renewable Energy of China’, which is promulgated by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) on November 24, 2014, as the world's largest energy consumer, China's energy consumption will increase 60% by 2030. Renewable energy power generation will account for a proportionate share of the global energy demand from the current 13%e16% in 2030. Meanwhile, the report predicts that by 2030, the proportion of renewable energy power generation will rise from the current 20%e40% in China, which can make China becoming the largest renewable energy consumption country in the world. In addition, the BP 2030 energy outlook report, which is promulgated by BP Amoco, predicts that the contribution rate of renewable energy technologies (RETs) to energy growth will increase from 5% to 18% in the period of 2010e2030. The power generation structure in China during 2020e2050 will have a big change. It is shown in Table 2.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) published the “World Energy Outlook of 2015” on 16 July 2015. It proposed that up to 2030, the global power generation of renewable energy power will be expected to be increased to reach 33% of the global total generation power. In the next 15 years, about two-thirds of the renewable power generation capacity in the world should be from China, the European Union, the United States and India, the rest from other countries.

(1) Wind power According to the Government's commitment in 2020 and 2030 to non-fossil energy accounting for 15% and 20% of the total primary energy consumption respectively, wind power will become one of the main energy technologies to achieve the low-carbon energy strategy in China, and the development will undergo three phases, the development plan for wind power in China is showed in Fig. 2:

The ﬁrst phase (2011e2020): offshore (intertidal) wind power will occupy the second place while onshore wind power will dominate the development. During this time, the annual increased wind power installed capacity will reach 15 GW and the cumulative installed capacity will reach 200 GW. Wind power will account for the total power installed capacity of 10%, and meet 5% of the demand for electricity.

From 2011 to 2014, the development of wind power installed capacity meets the planning requirements. It is shown in Table 3.

The second phase (2021e2030): without considering the interprovincial transmission costs, wind power generation costs less than coal. Wind power development will focus on both onshore and offshore in this period. The annual new installed capacity will be about 20 GW and the total installed capacity will reach 400 GW. The proportion of wind power generation will reach 8.4% and the ratio of the power structure will expand to around 15%.

The third phase (2031e2050): wind development will be directed towards the midwest onshore wind power and the eastern offshore wind power. The annual increased installed capacity will reach 30 GW and the cumulative installed capacity will reach 1000 GW, accounting for 26% of the power structure.

(2) Solar power Distributed photovoltaic power generation will be an important direction for renewable energy development in the future. According to the 12th 5-year plan, China's total PV installed capacity will reach 35 GW by the end of 2015, and the distributed PV projects will reach approximately 20 GW, which accounts for 57% of total PV installed capacity. In 2015, the target of total PV installed capacity up to 2020 is 150 GW, which replaces 100 GW [25]. Meanwhile, in the mid-eastern region, China will accelerate the construction of distributed photovoltaic power generation; in the western region, China will accelerate the construction of a largescale solar power station and so on. Then, China will form a good development pattern to realize the simultaneous development of large-scale and distributed solar photovoltaic power generation.

China has introduced a large number of policies to promote the development of renewable energy and the industrialization of the industry since 2005. These favourable policies cover the feed-in tariff, ﬁnancial subsidy, tax deduction and other technological support. In addition, to create a favourable market and investment environment, China initially established the renewable energy regulatory system. The “Renewable Energy Law”, “Electricity Regulatory Ordinance”, “Renewable Energy Prices and Cost-Sharing Management Pilot Scheme”, “Grid Enterprises Purchase Renewable Electricity Regulatory Approach” and “Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Power Work Safety” formed the main legal basis for the current renewable energy regulation policy system. Combined with “Several opinions about further deepening the reform of electric power system (Zhong Fa〔2015〕No.9)” and “The opinions of pilots about the renewable energy consumption to the nearest (provisional)”, this covers policies such as renewable energy priority access, power grid construction subsidies and other speciﬁc quota policy content as shown in Fig. 3.

In China, the National Energy Administration (NEA) regulates market behaviours by relying on renewable energy regulation policies. The renewable energy regulation in the future will mainly include economic regulation, social regulation and antitrust regulation. Among these, the regulation on power generation enterprises focuses on economic ﬁelds, such as price supervision, subsidy regulation, etc. Regulation against the electricity market

highlights the social ﬁeld, including the situation to fulﬁl the obligations of system security, electricity market entry and exit conditions, market information disclosure and various standards for renewable energy technologies, safety, electricity quality, etc. However, the regulation of power grid companies is the most strict and comprehensive, covering renewable energy grid connection circumstances, power scheduling, electrical power security and even the condition of market conservation. The details are shown in Fig. 4.

Compared with EU countries, China has made progress in renewable energy development. However, it has still not reached a high contribution rate in the optimization of the energy structure. In addition, there are some negative phenomena in the consumption of renewable energy. Taking wind power for example, the National Energy Administration (NEA) pointed that in the half of 2015 the utilization of wind power only was 993 h. And the wind curtailment rate was 15.17% while the wind curtailment loss was 17.481 TWh. The main factors restricting China's renewable energy grid connection and consumption are institutional factors and market mechanisms.

(1) Institutional factors

Currently, the renewable energy regulation policy system in China to support renewable energy development is still incomplete. The existing policy system lacks coordination among the relevant policies and planning. It cannot form a long-term efﬁcient

mechanism to support the sustainable development of renewable energy. Therefore, government-leading, organization and the cost of direct advances become the prerequisite for China's renewable energy industry to take off. The industrial beneﬁts induced by government ﬁnancial support are planning indicators' traction rather than equity investments or the traction of the market price.

(2) Market mechanisms

China's power market are open to competition in electricity generation and electricity sale at present, however, the related sale policies about electricity have not been carried out fully. There is still a natural monopoly in the transmission and distribution sectors. No mandatory market safeguard policy has been issued, and renewable energy development is merely guaranteed by the protective acquisition policy. The lack of continued market-driven results in renewable energy development cannot form a stable market demand. Furthermore, it hinders the long-term development to some extent. In addition, factors such as the small scale and high prices hinder the capability of independent commercial development. It is difﬁcult for renewable energy to compete with other fossil fuels. At the same time, various technology bottlenecks have limited the establishment of renewable energy markets.

To some extent, the existing regulation system has restricted the development of renewable energy. In the current renewable energy regulation policy system, economic regulation policies occupy the dominant position. To a certain extent, the neglect of social and antitrust regulation has resulted in certain deviations appearing in the renewable energy market regulation mechanisms, expressed as:

(1) Market regulation is not in position. The existing renewable energy regulation system in China lacks the overall operations of the electricity market. It puts too much emphasis on the control of grid enterprises in the implementation process, thus weakening the control of other market players. Meanwhile, it is inclined towards mandatory regulation and lacks a market adjustment mechanism.

(2) The existing renewable energy regulation system focuses on the front part of approval procedures, so that the supervision during and after the project is relatively weak. There is a phenomenon of “approval-emphasized, supervision-contempt” in the development of renewable energy. At the same time, energy management pays more attention to economic regulation, such as investment, pricing and production scale. It is relatively weak in the social regulation of the environment, safety, quality, resource conservation and other external issues.

(3) Economic regulation is in the dominant position that ignores the coordinative development of society. To some extent, it results in renewable energy planning being uncoordinated with the market consumption, grid construction and other power generation planning. Moreover, the lack of coordination between local planning and national planning has seriously hampered the development of renewable energy.

Meanwhile, from the perspective of promoting renewable energy development in the long run, China's existing economic regulatory policies in terms of tariff and subsidy incentives are relatively weak:

1) The tariff mechanism is in a low-oriented level. Firstly, the main tariff mechanism for renewable energy power is a ﬁxed tariff pricing mode, and the ﬁxed tariff pricing mode is ﬁxed tariff per kWh by regional or the provincial average cost based on the operating period electricity price. The mechanism can be effective in stimulating enterprises to develop in the early stage. However, from a long-term perspective, it is not ﬂexible enough to reﬂect the scarcity of resources, market supply and demand. It cannot truly reﬂect the environmental costs and reasonable compensation so it is unfavourable to the sustainable development of renewable energy. Secondly, electricity price, which was formed by the market in stage except welfare price, was proposed in March 2015. The mechanism can improve the market level of electricity price. However, the mechanism is in a pilot phase, and lacks of appropriate speciﬁc market-based policies.

2) Subsidy incentives are not in place. In the current subsidy policy system, there are no subsidy incentives for producers or consumers, but there are investment subsidies. Although subsidies for investors can stimulate the production of enthusiasm, it is

difﬁcult to play the role of encouraging renewable energy technologies to update or costs to reduce. Subsidy incentives for output and consumers are beneﬁcial to the future development of renewable energy. On one hand, they help to increase the product yield, reduce costs and improve economic efﬁciency. On the other hand, they will expand the market demand by stimulating consumption, and in turn the renewable energy development will drive the expansion of productivity, in order to achieve the cost reduction effect.

In order to better promote the development of renewable energy and regulate the behaviours of the market, rational renewable energy regulation policies should consider market operation, environmental strategies. And renewable energy regulation policy reform should be implemented in stages.

The essence of renewable energy regulation is to promote the development of renewable energy from government guidance to market-driven development, from policy leading to industrial growth and from regulatory imitation to innovation. Therefore, the path of renewable energy regulation policy design should adhere to the following principles:

(1) The principle of development Renewable energy regulation is a process with stage characteristics. It needs dynamic adjustment and constant development. Regulatory agencies need to adjust the renewable energy regulation contents appropriately, relying on different developing stages, not only matching the stage of electricity markets and the renewable energy development strategy, but also adapting to the national energy planning and energy conservation goals. Gradually, the development of renewable energy in China will move from government support to market-driven development.

(2) The principle of coordination Renewable energy regulation needs to reﬂect the wholeness and coordination of renewable energy development. On one side, renewable energy regulation must play a role in balancing the relationship between economic regulation, social regulation and antitrust regulation. Changing the old regulatory mode, which was inclined towards economic regulation, is necessary to achieve fullﬂow control of renewable energy from the development plan to terminal consumption. On the other side, renewable energy regulation should properly handle the interaction between mandatory regulation and market-driven regulation and properly solve the problem of energy substitution, so that the intensity and speed of development are combined with China's development stage and future economic strength, technology, environmental requirements, resources, energy security and cost advantages to weigh other factors.

(3) The principle of innovation Renewable energy regulation should reﬂect the characteristics of innovation. Therefore, China should integrate the foreign experience of renewable energy regulation with its own development conditions, actively exploring suitable regulatory mechanisms. In order to achieve a new leap in development in the renewable energy regulation ﬁeld, China needs to strengthen the reforming of the renewable energy regulation system to policy innovation. For example, policy makers can achieve innovation from the following aspects: Establish a “big energy outlook”, ensuring the security of the energy supply and power system. Renewable energy regulators agencies need to pay close attention to the scientiﬁc analysis of the domestic renewable energy supply and demand and investment changes, in order to make timely adjustments to regulatory policies.

  Clearly the main renewable energy regulatory objective is to promote sustainable development. To adapt to energy restructuring and the trend of low-carbon development, regulatory agencies should give policy support for investment, access, pricing and taxes to promote the development of renewable energy and provide strict supervision of the implementation of supporting policies.   Actively carry out the regulation on social responsibility to ensure that the relevant players fulﬁl their social responsibility. To some extent, this will promote social harmony and environmental protection and achieve other social goals.

In response to economic growth and climatic and environmental challenges to renewable energy development, renewable energy regulation policy will be continuously adjusted and optimized. It will roughly experience three important phases:

(1) The government support phase: renewable energy development is in the government support and policy guiding phase.

(2) The transition phase: renewable energy development is in the infancy combination stage of promoting and marketdriven policies.

(3) The market-driven phase: renewable energy development is in the stage of constantly reducing administrative intervention and gradually increasing effective regulation.

Key contents of renewable energy regulation in the government-supported phase In the government-supported phase, China's industrialization and urbanization will enter a period of accelerated development, during which resource and environmental constraints will continually grow. Energy saving and emission reduction, as well as a rapid response to climate change, will become the main point of the national economic policies. At the same time, renewable energy development is given a higher priority as a strategic choice with the trend of the electricity market reform and internationalization. China will intensify the regulation in the economic, social and antitrust ﬁelds, and the details are as follows in Fig. 5:

(1) Economic regulation Economic regulation will be undertaken through direct intervention, such as pricing, entry and competition rules, to change the parameters of electric power enterprise decision making and orientation so as to achieve the objective of government monitoring. The speciﬁc controls are as follows:

  Implementation of the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).

  Regulation on the feed-in tariff, in particular the implementa-

tion of pricing policies for promoting energy conservation.

  Regulation on the electricity prices of transmission and distri-

bution. At the same time, the wholesale electricity prices and

the terminal retail prices should be regulated.

  Regulation on inter-provincial transmission line loss standards, regulating line loss-sharing behaviour in inter-provincial trade.   Regulating the implementation of electricity price policies for trans-regional trade and a special fund for renewable energy development and tariff cross-subsidies.   Strengthening the supervision of electricity costs, statistically aggregating and disclosing information about cost and price timeliness.   Strengthening the supervision of the renewable energy power market trading.   Strict control of the waste of wind and light resources. Concretely, prescribing the proportion of renewable energy power generation and specifying the condition in which operators can take action to abandon electricity.   Strengthening the supervision of the ancillary service market. Integrating renewable energy into the electricity grid ancillary services' evaluation and compensation system.   Compensating renewable energy power generation enterprises in special conditions. Grid operators will pay compensation if their fault resulted in the loss of electricity, and renewable energy power generation enterprises will be compensated by consumers in the condition of non-grid operators' fault.

(2) Social regulation Social regulation mainly includes the regulation of electricity safety, universal service and environment. Electrical safety regulations include:

  Strengthening the management of business qualiﬁcation.

  Enhancing the regulation of small-scale power generation en-

terprises' basic situation, the existing problem and the imple-

mentation of the licencing system.

  Regulating the safety of renewable energy grid connection.

Universal service regulations are as follows:

  Supervising the construction of the power grid.

  Regulating the preparation time of renewable energy grid connection.

  Controlling the construction of peak load regulating power plants, such as pumped storage and gas-ﬁred power stations. Additionally, taking the renewable energy network feed-in construction planning into the regulation of power-grid construction planning.

Environmental regulations are as follows:

  Exercising supervision and inspection of the implementation of environmental policies, rulers and standards.

  Improving the control of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.

  Strengthening the regulation of coal-ﬁred power plant recon-

struction with desulphurization and denitration processes.

(3) Antitrust regulation Antitrust regulations include:

  The situation of grid feed-in. Regulating the renewable energy power projects, especially distributed power grid feed-in, and overseeing the power grid to achieve the maximum extent of fairness and openness.   Regulating grid operators in providing timely services to renewable energy enterprises for their access.   Supervising the grid-connected service system for distributed generation, including grid-connected access systems to distributed PV, management procedures and grid-connected service processes.

In addition, the Government will focus on the construction of renewable energy tracking supervision mechanisms in important areas and key projects. To develop the coordinated services well, it will particularly strengthen the whole-process monitoring of the renewable power supply projects connected to the grid.

 Regulatory policy in the government support phase In the government support phase, China should gradually perfect the competitive incentives and energy technology policies to improve the proportion of renewable energy products. To solve the existing problems in three northern regions (Northeast China, Northwest China and North China) and the distributed energy resource grid-connected issues, the Government will introduce policies such as a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and energy-saving dispatching and further improve the ancillary services market to establish a market-oriented compensation mechanism in which wind power should participate. Accountability through administrative means can achieve top-down binding emission reduction targets, strengthening energy-saving targets and introducing a systematic policy to promote the development of renewable energy at the same time. Meanwhile, attention should be paid to the role of demand-side policies, taking measures such as tax incentives and ﬁnancial subsidies to stimulate consumers' demand.

Transitional phase regulatory policy research

Key contents of renewable energy regulation in the transitional phase In the transitional phase, the electricity market in China will be gradually established. To some extent, the developing pricing mechanism reform and market mechanism will gradually promote renewable energy development, diverting towards the combination of policy support and market-driven development. During this period, renewable energy regulation will implement appropriate elastic power regulatory policies, relaxing electricity market access, investment and generation bidding. In order to solve the problems

of external diseconomies and information asymmetries that exist in the electric power industry, the Government will focus on the control of power supply obligations, electricity general obligations, environmental protection and technological progress. The details are as follows:

  Regulation on the entry and exit of the renewable energy power market, authorizing and overseeing the NECC (New Energy Chamber of Commerce) on the certifying of green electricity.

  Sales price for renewable energy electricity.

  Implementation of a renewable energy power generation programme.

  Whether the total amount of renewable energy electricity production is lower than the actual number of green certiﬁcates.   Renewable energy electricity companies will progress in carrying out marketing and providing after-sales service.

  Ensuring the regions' implemented renewable energy portfolio standard is fully compliant with the contract.

  Supervising the marketing behaviour to prevent non-renewable power being sold to users at the same price as renewable energy electricity.

  Renewable energy market information disclosure, including the annual sales volume and prices, the total acquisition and the implementation of large consumers' direct power purchase.

Regulatory policy in the transitional phase The renewable energy regulation policy system in China will transform the old mode focussing on economic regulation and preapproval into a new one that pays attention to social regulation and whole process-based regulation. Safety, green development and economic efﬁciency will become the basic starting point and key constraints for renewable energy policy making, or even a series of economic policies. The renewable energy regulation policy system will mean a big change in the future work. It will start from the focus on a single target to increase the renewable energy supply proportion to multiple targets promoting renewable energy development. At the same time, it will optimize the energy structure and improve the efﬁciency of resource allocation via the introduction of market competition mechanisms. The new era renewable energy regulation policy system will focus on resolving the long-standing problems in the current condition, such as regulation inadequacy caused by the lack of social regulation. The Government will comprehensively take safety, environment and efﬁciency savings into consideration, to form a new model that combines things in advance and afterwards.

Market-driven phase regulatory policy research

Key contents of renewable energy regulation in the marketdriven phase After 2030, China will have established a reasonable price regulation mechanism and a market-driven mode of renewable energy regulation will have been published. In this time, renewable energy regulation will make progress in market order regulation. It will strengthen antitrust regulation to promote effective competition and accelerate the establishment of users' conﬁdence. Meanwhile, social regulation will focus on improving resource utilization to ensure energy supply security and protect the ecological environment. The details are as follows:

(1) Regulations on the power generation market

  Prescribed electricity suppliers, to provide their product, must include at least a certain percentage of renewable energy electricity. The ratio should be based on the speciﬁc location of the electricity supplier, resource endowments and power consumption.   The availability of renewable energy power plants in the competitive market and its electricity must meet quality standards.

(2) Regulations on the trade market

  Regulation of market order, mainly market fairness, justice and openness.

  Regulation of the trading centre, ensuring that data and infor-

mation are published accurately and in a timely manner.

(3) Regulations on the sales company

  Regulation of the sales company's behaviour on propaganda for renewable energy electricity and the condition of the information announced.

(4) Regulations on the power transmission company

  Supervising the security and stable operation of the power grid, in order to reduce the adverse effects caused by market bidding.   Regulating the service-providing condition, examining whether the power transmission company is fulﬁlling its obligations for technical modernization with capacity expansion to commit actively to promoting renewable energy consumption.   Regulating the income ceiling. Establishing a method to dedicate the power transmission costing and provide strict supervision of the cost.   Regulating the fees the power transmission companies charge for renewable energy grid connection.

Regulatory policy in the market-driven phase In the market-driven phase, the renewable energy regulation policy will focus on two points: namely, to reduce government intervention and increase the effective supervision. The Government will pay attention to the construction of market-adjusting mechanisms, and then the market will play an important role in

adjusting the relationship between the renewable energy electricity demand and the sales prices. In addition, to stimulate renewable energy market scale and industrialization, the Government will gradually improve the renewable energy development mechanism in the ﬁelds of product market incentives, pricing, market competition, industry ﬁnancial compensation, the industry resources ﬂow mechanism and the linkage of industry management and service.

The design of China's renewable energy regulation policy development path

With the reform and development of the electricity market, China will gradually develop a social regulation-based renewable energy regulation model. Its key work will shift from the supply side of power generation to the demand side and from administrative regulation to market-driven regulation as well. The change will beneﬁt enhanced power demand side management (DSM) and relieve the contradiction of demand and supply for renewable energy regulation power to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the Government will highlight the management of energy-saving, energyefﬁcient technology in order to make a notable improvement in power demand-side management. Accordingly, the renewable energy regulation policy will realize the target to change from the current administrative-based simpliﬁcation system to a comprehensive policy system that integrates the factors of economic, legal, administration, ﬁnance, technology and technical standards. The renewable energy development will turn to market-driven development and the renewable energy regulation policy system will be notably more market-oriented and socialized. The renewable energy regulation policy development path in China is shown in Fig. 6.

(1) Economic regulatory policies: these will emphasize policy orientation, openness and transparency, gradually realizing the renewable energy pricing mechanism with a combination of market-driven and government guidance. In the early stage, adopting transitional tariff reform policies by using the cost plus regulatory mode and a stronger incentive price-cap regulatory approach will be introduced with the maturation of development. Meanwhile, investment subsidies should be applied to achieve an appropriate increase in the level of subsidies to power grid enterprises earlier, and must take the renewable energy development condition into consideration during decision making. With the maturity of the markets, subsidy policies for renewable energy development will gradually be cancelled.

(2) Social regulatory policies: these will consider the coordinated development among renewable energy, economy, society and environment, establishing and continually improving regulatory policies in the social ﬁeld, such as resource efﬁciency, environmental protection and electrical power security.

(3) Antitrust regulatory policies: in the early stage, the implementation of the quota system, relying on government support, will be vigorously promoted and dynamic adjustment made each year. Regulatory agencies' market behaviours will be constrained through the national legislative norms. In the period of transition, green certiﬁcates and green-price projects should be gradually implemented in order to achieve the freedom for users to make a choice. In the mature period, policies related to the renewable energy industrial investment fair market competition mechanism, renewable energy resources' ﬂow mechanism and renewable energy industrial management and service system linkage mechanism should be perfected, which will help to achieve free market competition and guarantee the renewable energy development in the direction of scalization and industrialization.

In summary, the regulatory policy to promote renewable energy consumption in China is shown as Fig. 6.

There is a certain independent development path in the evolution of the renewable energy market and structural changes, and the vital factor is the Government's (policy) participation. In this paper, the author comprehensively takes the condition of China's electricity market and the renewable energy development stage into consideration. According to the degree of government involvement and the role of the market, renewable energy development can be divided into three main stages: the government support phase, the transitional phase and the market-driven phase. A policy path that adapts to China's electricity market and renewable energy development is designed based on the three development stages, and it strictly follows the principles of development, coordination and innovation.

(1) In the government-supported phase, renewable energy development takes off as a result of government guidance and policy support. Therefore, mandatory regulation and an incentive policy should be implemented to promote renewable energy development, on one hand accelerating the implementation of the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and clearing the quota obligations of power grid companies and power generation enterprises by administrative means and on the other hand strengthening the economic regulation of the renewable energy tariff, tax incentives, subsidies and other aspects, ensuring that renewable energy generation companies have greater productive enthusiasm.

(2) During the transitional phase, China should insist on the principle that renewable energy regulation policy incentives and market mechanisms need to be combined harmoniously, optimizing the developing mechanisms of renewable energy via strengthening the regulation of electrical power safety, market transactions and other social ﬁelds. The enthusiasm of investors

needs to be mobilized by market operation, in order to realize the development of renewable energy driven by policy support diverted to the market.

(3) In the market-driven phase, renewable energy regulation should strengthen the social regulation and antitrust regulation of market transactions rather than the direct control of the market body. It should guide the formation of a fair and open market mechanism to improve the free competition and fair trading mechanism and the beneﬁt prevention mechanism.

The establishment and improvement of the power regulatory system is the main content of the electricity market reform. It would be progressively perfected along with the continued progress of the market reform. Therefore, China's renewable energy regulation should follow the steps of market development. To ensure the renewable energy regulation mechanism is adapted to the electricity market, it is necessary to maintain the continuity of policy development.

2,A review of residential tiered electricity pricing in China,"At present, the unformed market-oriented pricing mechanism has become a great challenge faced by China's electricity pricing. And the unreasonable electricity pricing caused by cross subsidization has become increasingly serious with the economic development and energy shortage. Tiered electricity price (TEP), which was developed and used since 1970s, was introduced into China as a new electricity pricing method for residential electricity consumption. The TEP can also improve the tariffs, the behaviors and the efficiency of residential electricity consumption. In this study, we use the fundamental theory of the Electricity Economics to analyze the pricing methods and the forms of China's power market with the reform of electric power industry. We also point out the characteristics of residential tiered electricity pricing in China, which is also compared with other countries, such as the United States and Japan. The main factors influencing the residential tiered electricity pricing design are discussed in this paper from the perspectives of users, the electric power enterprise and government regulation. Then we point out the main problems of China's existing tiered electricity pricing, including inadequate level of public awareness and acceptance, unreasonable tiered and electricity price standard, insufficient reflection in regional differences, less combination with other electricity pricing forms, and low-level of smart meter application.","1. Introduction

Energy is an important material foundation for the survival of human beings and the rapid development of economy [1]. China's rapid economic development has brought great changes to the country and the society, since the reform and opening up in 1978. However, it has also brought serious energy and environmental problems [2]. From 2005–2014, China's total energy consumption has grown from 2.61 billion tons of standard coal to 4.26 billion tons of standard coal, accounting for 22.99% of the world's total energy consumption [3,4]. The energy industry is a pillar industry of the national economy, in which the electric power industry is in a prominent position. The development of many industries relies on the support of the electric power industry, which plays an important role to the sustainable and healthy development of a national economy [5]. During the process of industrialization and urbanization of China, the ﬁelds and the amount of electricity consumption keep on expanding and growing. In recent years, the electricity consumption elasticity in China is becoming higher than the energy consumption elasticity coeﬃcient. It suggests that electricity consumption has become the main driving force of China's energy consumption.

The development of China's new urbanization policy promotes the

migration of residents from rural to urban and also improves the quality of rural-life. The proportion of residential electricity consumption in the national total electricity consumption, as an important part in the electricity consumption structure [6], has increased from 11.57% in 2005 to 12.89% in 2013 [3]. Its growth rate was faster than the overall electricity consumption growth rate in recent ten years. Electricity consumption had brought beneﬁt to economic development, at the same time when economic growth stimulated electricity consumption [7,8]. By facing the growing demand of residential electricity consumption, the electricity pricing mechanism problem of China has existed in a long period including unreasonable price structure and serious cross subsidization [9,10]. Liu et al. [11] pointed out that the current cross subsidization of China can be divided into two forms. The transverse one is among the similar users of diﬀerent voltage levels and the longitudinal one is between diﬀerent industrial users under the same voltage level. Especially the residential electricity pricing was long-term subsidized. The commercial and industrial electricity price should be lower than residential price in view of economic eﬃciency

[12], which is accepted by the international community. The ratio of the residential and industrial electricity price in most developed countries is around 1.5–2 [13], and the ratio of China is in 0.8–0.9

[14], which is signiﬁcantly lower than international average level. It means that the electricity price of industry and commerce subsidies residential eletricity price, which formed the cross subsidies. Meanwhile, in a single static price, diﬀerent electricity users share the same electricity price, which directly leads to the subsidies from low to high electricity consumption users [15]. Cross-subsidization not only leads to the imbalance of electricity pricing structure and the long-term revenue loss of the power enterprise, but also reduces the social electricity utilization eﬃciency. Murata et al. [16] suggested that if China's residential users can improve the utilization eﬃciency of household appliances, 28% of electricity consumption can be reduced by 2020.

Therefore, the Tiered electricity price (TEP) was introduced in China residential electricity consumption area, aiming to improve the status of cross subsidies by increasing block price. At the same time, it can also improve the utilization eﬃciency of electric power and relieve the pressure on energy supply. Reasonable residential tiered pricing form can signiﬁcantly improve the eﬃciency of residential eletricity consumption [17].

The Residential Tiered Electricity Price Policy (RTEP) has been formally implemented in China since July 2012. It has received widespread attention of the whole society and opened a new round of China's electric power industry reform. However the theoretical research works, standards and speciﬁcations, operation and management techniques on China's RTEP are still lacking [13]. This paper presents a systematic review on the research and development status of the RTEP in China. First, we analyze the present implementation of China's RTEP using the principles of electricity pricing in Section 2. Then China's RTEP development is compared with the practice of some other countries in Section 3. The inﬂuencing factors and existing problems of China's RTEP are discussed in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

2. Residential tiered electricity pricepricing (RTEP) in China

2.1. Electricity pricing in China

Electricity is a special secondary energy, which was converted by other primary energy and could meet the production and living demand after transmission and exchange. Besides the commodity basic value property [18], the electricity also needs to be considered as a special commodity with special properties in the process of the electricity market reform. The special properties of electricity are that it is hard to store, lack of substitutes and only single mode of transportation [19]. Therefore the power market is quite diﬀerent from the general market and is more diﬃcult to enter and exit than other industries. Also, the hard-to-store property of electricity is sometimes accompanied with signiﬁcant price ﬂuctuation and great demand for transmission and distribution equipment [20,21].

During the process of rapid economic growth, China's electricity demand was also expanding, as shown in Fig. 1. After the long-term implementation of planned economy and the absolute monopoly, the traditional power industry keep the power market in a state of relatively low eﬃciency. The power supply cannot meet the surge in power demand and the power shortages restricted the further development of the economy to a certain extent [22,23]. Tsai and Wang [24,25] believed that the power shortages should be related to the over centralization and the absolute monopoly of power market. The marketization of power enterprise will be a necessary way to solve this problem. China has also implemented a series of power industry reform measures. Since 1985, the government has gradually began to loosen the electricity monopoly in China's power market, which is known as the stages of “separation of government and state-owned power enterprise” and “separation of power plant and grid”. After that, the electricity price has three forms, including the pool purchase price, the transmission and distribution price and the retail power price.

In traditional monopoly power mode, the power generation enterprises and transmission and distribution enterprises are all based on the national monopoly operation [26]. Due to the fact that they belong to the same system as shown in Fig. 2, there was no transaction process between the two types of power enterprises, and the power plant was invested by government for free. It makes the early pool purchase price had little practical signiﬁcance. As the gradually perfection of China's power market, the pool purchase price became diﬀerent from the other prices. It has used to encouraged various social investments of power industry and expected the return on investment, by using the electricity pricing of debt service form [25]. However, the debt service pricing (DSP) form has brought over-investment and incontrollable construction scale, which made the pool purchase price high and aﬀected the retail price. Then the electricity pricing of operating period form (OPF) was adopted, made the return period extended to the entire operating period to ease the excessive electricity price. The DSP and OPF policy reﬂected the transition process of China's electricity pricing, from government pricing to the market pricing [27]. On the basis of OPF, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) promulgated a benchmark pricing policy in 2004. The current pool purchase price in China is two-part electricity pricing, which consists of capacity price and the consumption price. Nowadays, the power generation method becomes diversiﬁed, and the renewable clean power generation way developed rapidly. The diﬀerence of the generation capacity and the electricity cost level among diﬀerent generation ways was huge. The bidding mode will become an important form of China's electricity price.

In the year of 2015, “Some opinions on further deepening the reform of electric power system” was issued by the NDRC. It pointed out that the new stage of power reform is about power market. The pilot projects of transmission and distribution price will be implemented in some provinces. At the early stage of China's power industry reform, the foreign investment was ﬁrst allowed to enter the generation market of China. Nevertheless, the department of transmission and distribution was still under control of the national electric power department in a long-period [25]. The transmission and distribution price was not formed through market competition, but set by the price administrative department of the State Council. The situation is that only transmission and distribution price was diﬀerent from the pool purchase price and retail price, and it will be changed in the new reform stage. The classiﬁcation of retail price mainly depends on the types of power users. The users are divided into eight types i.e., residential and non-residential users, large-scale industrial, general industrial and non-industrial users, commercial users, wholesale users and agricultural users. Besides the generation market competition, gradually ﬁerce competition also began in the retail market. It promotes the optimal allocation of the electricity resources. The retail price is the end price of power industry. The joint and competition of two power market are the future direction of power industry reform [28].

Many researches focus on electricity pricing method from the perspectives of accounting cost methods [29–31], long-term marginal cost methods [15,31–36] to the Ramsey pricing methods [10,37–41].

Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 79 (2017) 533–543

Fig. 2. The change of China electric power system reform in December 2002.

In early time, the accounting cost method was widely used in various industrial ﬁelds [30], and the electricity price based on this method mainly considered the average cost which happened in the process of production and sales. It is the most widely used and basic pricing method. The design on this pricing method reﬂects the actual cost, the proﬁts and taxes of the power enterprise. It is simple to calculate and the developing countries prefer to the accounting cost method more. However, with the development of power market, the disadvantages of accounting cost method have gradually emerged. There includes ignoring the product demand elasticity, lack of ﬂexibility and over emphasis the recovery of sunk costs and they are negative to market competition [31].

Due to the lack of accounting cost method, marginal cost pricing method was introduced in the power market. Marginal cost method allows to add a reasonable investment return on the operating cost. It also used the incremental cost instead of average cost which was used in accounting cost method, to make it more suitable for the competitive electricity market [34]. Malik and Al Zubeidi [36] considered that the marginal cost, in the perspective of economics, is closer to the reasonable price of commodity and the purpose of pricing is to transfer cost better for consumers through the using time, voltage grade, geographical area, etc. Sun and Lin [15] presented that the marginal cost method is advantageous to the social proﬁt maximization and power market equilibrium. Friedman [31] suggested that electricity pricing based on marginal cost can ensure more eﬀective recovery of the electricity costs and reduce the expense. The marginal cost method can be divided into long-term marginal cost method (LRMC) and short-term marginal cost (SRMC). LRMC is based on the variable of electricity production capacity and equipment, which focuses on the consideration of power investment scale and is widely used in the world [33]. Bigerna [35] considered that the LRMC can also supervise power market by assisting government regulation to prevent unfair competition of power enterprises in the quotation. The SRMC method is based on the ﬁxed production equipment and reﬂects commodity prices on the existing marginal cost.

As a result of transmission line congestion in the process of actual electricity supply, there are still diﬀerences between actual electricity cost and the price calculated by marginal cost method. The Ramsey welfare, which made many researches turned to Ramsey pricing to pursue better results [41]. Nahata et al. [40] also believes that in natural monopoly mode, marginal cost method is not the best way, when the power industry has high ﬁxed cost. Ramsey pricing method further optimized the marginal cost method through the price elasticity demand [10]. It not only guarantees the basic interests of the power enterprise, but also ensures the maximization of social beneﬁts during the process of electricity price design. For the users which have large demand elasticity, it can control the electricity price ﬂuctuation and help avoiding decreasing demand.

Common forms of electricity price in electricity market mainly includes static and dynamic electricity price. Among them, static electricity price is the most basic form of electricity price in the early construction of electricity market. However, it needs to be improved regularly, in order to unify control the whole electricity market balance

[42]. With the continuous development of electricity pricing method, the traditional single static electricity price was no longer adapted to the change of the electric power market demand [43].

On the one hand, the dynamic electricity price becomes widely used. It minimizes the update period of the electricity price, in order to adjust the leverage of production and consumption. It makes up for the disadvantages of the static electricity price in terms of optimizing the allocation of resources [44]. It mainly includes the time-of-use electricity price (TOU) [43,48] and real-time electricity price (RTP) [44–47], which are both widely used. Economic development brings the expansion of the demand for electricity and the unbalanced distribution of demand has brought the huge power supply pressure

[49]. Chen and Hong [50] used Newton algorithm to prove that energy saving and positive inﬂuence was brought to the power generation side by using TOU. Traditional TOU price has a widespread application on the annual consumption peak and daily electricity consumption peak adjustment, which motivate users to transfer load [51]. Wang and Li

[48] proposed that TOU price makes users involved in pricing process by the analysis of the electricity consumption, to achieve the purpose of peak electricity demand remission. The RTP pricing was extension with the dynamic pricing mechanism's further development. Schweppe et al.

[45] pointed out that in the complete market, the RTP is the optimal choice on been electricity price signal, which achieve the value of demand response [47]. But the widespread implementation of RTP requires technical support, supporting policies, and high operating personnel quality [44]. On the other hand, static electricity price developed from unitary to the direction of tiered or time-parting. The ﬁrst oil crisis created the tiered electricity price (increasing block tariﬀs), by setting up suitable prices for diﬀerent electricity consumption block [45]. The TEP was used to control electricity consumption, optimize resources allocation, safeguard the basic electricity demand and keep electricity price and cost level in balance.

The development of power industry is always accompanied with the evolution of power from the special commodity to the general commodity [21]. In many countries, the national conditions should be taken with full considerations, as well as electricity price aﬀordable ability of all kind of electricity users. At the same time, the main purpose of the electricity design is to ensure that the electricity consumption blocks and the electricity price can improve residential electricity behaviors [9]. Although the lower price will beneﬁts consumers in a short term, the adverse impact for the future development on electric power industry will eventually damage the interests of consumers from the long-term point of view [52]. Reasonable electricity pricing policy will push the electricity prices to the optimal level.

2.2. The implementation of the RTEP in China

Faced by increasingly severe energy situation, the RTEP policy was introduced in China, which focus on the problem of energy utilization. The Zhejiang and Fujian province, which have large electricity demand, made the ﬁrst trail in 2004 and the Sichuan province joined the pilot in 2006. Soon in 2009, the RTEP was proposed to be extended to nationwide [53] and on October 9, 2010, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued ""the guidance of the RTEP on residential electricity consumption (Draft for Comments) "", to collect the opinions on the RTEP from whole society. In November 2011, the NDRC introduced the guidance on RTEP,which divided the monthly residential electricity consumption into three tiers and founded a free tier for low-income families. On March 28, 2012, The NDRC announced that the ﬁnal implementation of RTEP will guarantee stable electricity prices of 80% household in China [54]. Finally in July 1, 2012, after two years summary and adjustment, the RTEP was formally implemented in China and 29 provinces and cities have announced a complete solution before August 7, 2012.

There are numerous types of TEP, as the number of tiers change from 2 to 6 or more [55]. And the RTEP in China chooses to divide the electricity consumption into three tiers, which was consistent with most of the other countries [10]. The ﬁrst tier guarantees the most basic electricity demand of family life. The second tier increases 50140% from ﬁrst tier. The third tier is about 150–230% of the ﬁrst tier, as shown in Table 1. And as the price for ﬁrst tier, most provinces and cities keep the original price unchanged. The prices for second tier and third tier increase 0.05 CNY and 0.3 CNY from the basic price. Besides, the standard will increased for diﬀerent family size, like having ﬁve or more members in family. At the same time, a free tier was set up for low-income families, such as free 10–15 kW h every month. The free tier could be a special social security to ensure minimum household electricity consumption.

The standards for the RTEP have shown that the principle of RTEP is to ensure the electricity price stable for majority residential users in China. So the ﬁrst and second tiers include more than 80% consumption demand of residential users and the price these users paid has not changed after RTEP, as shown in Table 1. As the diﬀerent level of economic development and consumption demand among each province in China, the standard was set up speciﬁcally in diﬀerent provinces according to their own situation.

3. RTEP in some other countries and regions

In the 1970s, the outbreak of the ﬁrst oil crisis in the world made many countries engaged in the energy crisis. In order to cope with the serious energy and environmental situation, the TEP was introduced into these countries [9].

3.1. RTEP in the United States

The basic unit of the power market in the United States (the US) was based on each state. The main goal of RTEP in 1970s, is to meet the basic electricity demand of low-income families and to prevent resources from wasting by adjusting the price level. At the same time, electricity market model of generation and sale in the US is the free market. The power enterprises are independent market participants with high autonomy [56] and the state government is the main branch of electricity regulation [57]. So the main power enterprise in each state perform diﬀerent power standard and some of states are implementing the RTEP.

The tiers of the RTEP in each state are diﬀerent. Most of their tiers are 2 or 3, and the south area of California has changed the tiers from 5 [58] to 4 as shown in Table 2. Southern California Edison Corporation used the annual basic electricity consumption instead of speciﬁc number. Users in diﬀerent regions of south California or diﬀerent electricity usages have diﬀerent annual basic electricity consumption. The RTEP also has lots of combinations with other forms of electricity pricing [59]. Many states with vast territory has seasonal climate diﬀerences, which made season become an important factor inﬂuencing electricity pricing. The tariﬀ standard in summer is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the one in winter or other season [9]. The major domestic holidays were also considered as oﬀ-peak time and the ﬁrst consumption tier of special family with health issue could be raised, to reduce the electricity burden [60]. Since the implement of RTEP, the price level and electricity consumption have remained stable and each state developed their electricity price forms with their own characteristics.

It is similar in vast territory and regional disparities between China and the US. The standard of RTEP in China has also been considered with the diﬀerences between regions, seasons and other impact. However, the applications are not as various and ﬂexible as in the US. In the process of further improvement of the China's future reform, the uniﬁed tiers number should be only a reference and each province can improve and implement their standards. More tiers will be taken in the provinces with large economic disparities and less tiers in others. And the consumption standard of each tier should refer to southern California, with dynamic basic consumption.

3.2. RTEP in Japan

In Japan, rapid economic development led to the great increasing of total energy consumption demand [61]. However, as an island, Japan has less natural resource. In addition to the rare mineral local resources, like coal and gas, the other major energy is dependent on overseas [62]. The outbreak of the oil crisis directly led to the surge in the cost of power supply in Japan. The Japan's national economy growth went negative and electricity prices rose steeply at the same time, which made lower aﬀordability [9,58]. In this background, the RTEP was introduced into Japan on June 1974, to ensure the basic demand of low-income families. The RTEP has transferred more electricity costs to high-income people, and promoted the electricity saving [9,58].

Japan's power industry has been public utilities under government regulation. Although the electric power market is divided into diﬀerent power companies, the whole electricity industry of the state is uniﬁed. The electricity consumption standard was divided into three tiers of the Japan's RTEP. The ﬁrst tier, according to the minimum standard of household consumption, was set as 0–120 kW h per month and cost 17.87 JPY per kW h. The second tier was set as 121–300 kW h per month and cost 22.86 JPY per kW h [9]. The last tier was above 300 kW h and cost 24.13 JPY per kW h. After implementation, the boundary of second and third consumption tier has been adjusted in 1986, 1988 and 1996 [60]. The progressive rate of RTEP (the ratio of the highest price and lowest price) in Japan is less than 1.5, from which shows the gap between rich and poor in Japan is relatively small. So the high rate of tiers pricing is not necessary and the average electricity

consumption keeps in stable. After this, several supporting forms of electricity pricing was introduced, like the seasonal TOU pricing and peak-valley TOU pricing, to encourage residential users to reduce the peak electricity consumption and improve electricity load rate.

After the implementation of RTEP, the Japan's electricity consumption went stable [9]. Japan has basically achieved the purpose of reducing electricity consumption growth and saving electricity. Cambridge et al. [63] provided that since 2005, Japan's electricity demand tends to the saturation under economic development and population growth. In order to further energy conservation, a combination of variety electricity price models used in the RTEP in Japan, which became the formation of pricing packages for residential users to choose [58,59]. Pricing packages was designed variety and humanized. The Tokyo electric power company, for example, has more than ﬁve kinds of available packages just for diﬀerent ways to distinguish morning and evening, as shown in Table 3. The weekend packages, seasonal TOU plans and many others are also provided. These packages give full consideration to all kinds of residential user's characteristic.

The main development direction of RTEP in Japan is collecting user history consumption data and adjusting the basic consumption of each type users. The low price will be provided to the user whose consumption is below the basic consumption and the high price will be provided to the over one. New users with no history consumption record have to take the high price at ﬁrst. The combination with dynamic electricity price takes the factors of season and peak-valley period into consideration and makes dynamic tier standard instead of the ﬁxed tier. At the same time, to the less electricity consumption users, the electric capacity contract is used to avoid the cost of installing electric meter and reading meter. The Japan's residential electricity price was divided into basic electricity price, fuel adjustment price and some others. The Japanese lifestyle is similar to China. So the RTEP in China can also refer to the Japan's model, combined with various elements to improve the structure of electricity price and designed diﬀerent packages for diﬀerent users.

In addition, many other countries and regions have diﬀerent applications of RTEP. Canada [59] made the RTEP combined with two-part tariﬀ, both considering the inﬂuence of the electricity consumption and adding the load rate into the inﬂuence factors of electricity price calculation. And many power enterprises in Canada will make market competition factors full used. The RETP in South Korean [9,58,59] has nine tiers at ﬁrst. However, the tier number is excessive and it made the residential users lose the enthusiasm to adjust the consumption when they get close to the boundary of each tier. Then the main eﬀect of the RTEP will be lost. The tiers have been reduced to 6 and gradually are going to reach the international common tiers and low expansion ratio. At the same time as the implementation of Hong Kong's RTEP [59], Hong Kong electric company also launched electricity preferential policies. The electricity preferential plans are provided for the elderly people, disabled people, single parent families and the unemployed people. These users can enjoy 60% discount of 200 kW h in ﬁrst tier every month and the basic price and the minimum price will be canceled.

4. Application and research issues of RTEP

4.1. Inﬂuencing factors of RTEP design

Electric power industry is the important industry foundation for the steady development of social economy. It determines the competition of power enterprises in most countries and regions, which should be under the regulation of the government or relevant department [64]. The determination of electricity price will also be inﬂuenced by many factors besides the market supply and demand impact. As the view of the electricity price and electric power market development in most countries, the design of RTEP pricing method, strategy choice and pricing level should consider the impact of users, the electric power enterprise and government regulation.

(1) Users As the consumer of electricity, the user impact on electricity pricing has improved gradually during electricity pricing form shifting. In the form of single static electricity pricing, electricity price is mainly determined by the power companies and government, based on the costs of generation side and supply side. The demand side is diﬃcult to play a role as part of the supply and demand [53]. And for TOU pricing, diﬀerent property of the production and living activities leads to the change of consumption demand in peak-valley period. The electricity price will be set according to diﬀerent electricity demand in each period, which reﬂected the certain eﬀect of demand side by the form of electricity consumption changes. However, the TOU pricing method is mainly based on the long-term electricity consumption and guided the demand responds through peak-valley price. In RTP pricing, the shorter updating cycle of electricity pricing makes both the supply and demand sides had equal status in the pricing process. The RTP mode has maximized the eﬀect of demand side and reﬂected the price leverage eﬀectively. As a form of increasing block pricing, the RTEP aﬀected not only the electricity pricing by demand side, but also the user's choice of the price, at the same time in the process of electricity consumption.

The electricity consumption mode has been changed a lot with the development of economy. He and Reiner [65] believed that the electricity demand of China has transferred from the basic lighting to social communication and entertainment. Basic electricity consumption was aﬀected by multiple factors at present [66], including the geographical environment and climate property impact [16,65,67], diﬀerences between the urban and rural economic development level impact [16,17], household ﬁnancial impact [10,67,68] and other impacts [69,70]. Reinders et al. [67] and Lenzen et al. [68] provided that the main impacts of residential electricity consumption are the family income and expenditure. The inﬂuence was even more signiﬁcant than family electricity direct or indirect demand. The Family ﬁnancial impact directly aﬀected the quantity and quality energy consumption of home appliances and willingness to pay. In addition, the household income in China especially inﬂuenced on family house size. The geographical environment and climate factors inﬂuenced the residential electricity usage within a certain range, including the daily electricity peak-time and the seasonal electricity property. Murata et al. [16], based on the analysis of the questionnaire survey to the inhabitants of 13 cities in China, has found that the diﬀerence between large and small electricity consumption users was on the functions of cooling and water heating. These two functions are mainly caused by climate change [67]. At the same time, the types and quantities of household appliances, caused by the diﬀerences of the urban and rural economic development level, also cannot be ignored. The average number of household appliances diﬀerences of urban and rural [17] and the penetration rate of many new appliances in the economically developed cities or in other parts are also contributed to the electric electricity consumption [16].

(2) Power companies The national Electrical Supervisor Regulation Commission (SERC) divided the China power system into power generation, transmission, power supply and utilization [3], and three of them are power enterprises. Due to the reason that electricity pricing was built on the basis of actual costs incurred in power generation and power supply, the power enterprises are crucial to electricity pricing. Traditional China's power industry was monopoly by the government in long-terms, which made the power enterprises depended on the government. The government invested power generation enterprises in ﬁxed assets freely, which makes the expectation proﬁts of power enterprise unreasonable with electricity pricing. After the reform, the present electricity production has diverse ways and power generating forms are abundant. The new energy, especially renewable energy, will intensify the competition in power market after further liberalization [71]. Meanwhile, the improvement of the transmission and distribution grid trading technology and pricing reform improved their management and promoted to reduce electricity costs.

(3) Government Power, as the part of the energy industry, is related to the national economic lifeline. As a public utility, the steady and healthy development of power industry needs to be under proper supervision of the government and related departments. However, excessive regulation of market competition has negative impact on power industry and since the 1880s, the regulation all over world has gradually deregulated [72,73]. Wang et al. [74] believed that the government regulation of the power industry is mainly divided into two categories: one is that let electricity policy formulation department responsible for supervision, like Germany, France, other European countries and Japan; and the second one is similar to countries such as Britain and America, using the independent regulation system and regulatory agencies. The relationship between the central government and local regulators also can be divided into vertical regulation and multi-level regulation. In some countries, especially Britain, several branches regulators were set up in diﬀerent regions [75]. While some other countries, represented by the United States, choose two levels as federal and state regulatory. Federal regulation will adjust the power market and the state will take charge in the management of local power industry and have larger autonomy [57].

Before the reform of electric power, in order to adapt to the rapid growth of electricity demand, the China's government has controlled all transactions of the whole power industry. The responsibilities include the whole process of electric power production control and the price decision of electricity. However, with the changing of electricity supply and demand relations, Wang et al. [74] proposed that with the continuous development of China's economy, the electric power supervision system has become an obstacle. For the ﬁrst time in 1997, the China's government has tried to separate the power operation and supervision department into the State Power Corporation and the State Economic and Trade Commission. In 2003, the SERC was set up by the State Council to observe the duty of national electricity regulator. Xu and Chen [76] pointed out that the regulatory functions of SERC were adjusted for many times by the NDRC, to prevent its determination of electric pricing. And ﬁnally in 2013, the SERC was restructured and incorporated into the National Energy Administration, managed by the NDRC. The function of new SERC also turns more to maintain security, order and stability of electric power market. Government supervision strength is also related to electric power market perfection [76]. As the market has become increasingly strength of China's power industry, the supervision department will also relax some regulation of power industry. The focus of the work turned to the regulation of competitive process and more incentives to stimulate competition. In fact, Ruﬁn et al. [77] compared the electric power reform in China, India and Brazil and believed that the reform led by the Chinese government has the most signiﬁcant eﬀect.

2,A review of residential tiered electricity pricing in China,"At present, the unformed market-oriented pricing mechanism has become a great challenge faced by China's electricity pricing. And the unreasonable electricity pricing caused by cross subsidization has become increasingly serious with the economic development and energy shortage. Tiered electricity price (TEP), which was developed and used since 1970s, was introduced into China as a new electricity pricing method for residential electricity consumption. The TEP can also improve the tariffs, the behaviors and the efficiency of residential electricity consumption. In this study, we use the fundamental theory of the Electricity Economics to analyze the pricing methods and the forms of China's power market with the reform of electric power industry. We also point out the characteristics of residential tiered electricity pricing in China, which is also compared with other countries, such as the United States and Japan. The main factors influencing the residential tiered electricity pricing design are discussed in this paper from the perspectives of users, the electric power enterprise and government regulation. Then we point out the main problems of China's existing tiered electricity pricing, including inadequate level of public awareness and acceptance, unreasonable tiered and electricity price standard, insufficient reflection in regional differences, less combination with other electricity pricing forms, and low-level of smart meter application.","4.2. Challenges for implementing of RTEP in China

The RTEP in China has been implemented for more than three years and the speciﬁc implementation has improved in a series of process from the initial pilot scheme to the currently executing RTEP standard. Before the implementation of RTEP in July 2012, most provinces and regions held diﬀerent scales of hearings and listened to the public and media opinions, to correct their standards. From 20142015, most of the provinces changed the standard interval of RTEP from monthly to bi-monthly or yearly, to reduce residential electricity consumption ﬂuctuations impact on electricity bills.

From the view of China's residential users, the implementation of the RTEP has less impact on changing the residential electricity spending overall, in which 82% of households have no obvious changes in electricity expenditure. The average electricity cost of the second tier users increased 3.44–10.37 CNY every month and the growth of third tier users were 48.28–254.24 CNY [54]. Sun and Lin [15] believed that the sensitivity of price changing for diﬀerent levels of income families was also diﬀerent. The low-income families will be more sensitive than high-income households to electricity price rising [78]. Wu [79] presented electricity price can signiﬁcantly improve electricity consumption eﬃciency. And Wang et al. [80] also suggested that the user willingness to consider and choose energy-eﬃcient appliances has improved, when electricity price rose excessively. Therefore, RTEP can better guide the development of residential electricity consumption in the direction of high eﬃciency and economical way. And high income family, especially the one with high electricity consumption, will spend more on electricity cost to induce better electricity consumption [51].

In addition to the positive impact of RTEP, the problems existing in the current tiered electricity price of China were summarized in ﬁve points.

(1) The public awareness and acceptance level is not high Although the RTEP has been widely implemented all over the world since the 1970s, for China it is still a novelty. A large part of the residential users misunderstood the RTEP as a policy to improve the electricity cost, and emotionally conﬂicted to the policy [56]. On one hand, Du et al. [56] believed that the reason of such misunderstandings was low price beneﬁts, which was enjoy by China's residential users from price subsidies for a long time. The users were not aware of the status quo of low residential electricity level and its negative inﬂuence on the social economy. They performed sensitive to electricity price ﬂuctuation and the sudden raise electricity price cannot be accepted [81]. On the other hand, the misunderstanding was also caused by the monopoly of national electric power industry [82], which has made unreasonable proﬁt levels. The residential users believed that the increase of electricity price is to enlarge the further proﬁts of electric power enterprises [83], so they resist the electricity price rising as the protection of their own interests [10].

Chen and Wang [84] proposed that China's government has too much ""political baggage"", in the process of pursuing the RTEP and overly worried the residential accept ability of electricity price policy changing. It made the low price problem insoluble. However, Wang et al. [77] also pointed out that due to the political sensitivities of residential electricity price, the government should be carefully considered residential acceptance degree. Herter et al. [85] presented that electricity price reform should give full consideration to the needs and attitudes of residential users. Therefore, eliminating misunderstanding will promote the implement of RTEP in China. Ma and He [71] pointed out that low transparency will make the policy reform could not achieve the desired eﬀect and China's government should work on the transparency improvement of power policy and promote science popularization of electric power reform to masses. (2) The tiered and standard of the electricity was unreasonable Electricity pricing schemes are inﬂuenced by supplier ability, allocative eﬃciency, the distribution policy and so on [86,87] and the reasonable RTEP will also aﬀect the energy saving and eﬃciency. Especially when the ﬁrst tier consumption was set up too high, the actual implementation of RTEP will be meaningless. It will also cause the subsidies from low-income families to highincome families with social unfairness [58,88]. He and Reiner [65] proposed the ﬁrst tier have the protection eﬀect to low-income families in developing countries, by maintaining the basic lighting and heating consumption.

Currently, the RTEP of China still has China's characteristics.

Due to considering the problems of electricity structure in a longperiod, most of the residential electricity expenditure was not aﬀected after the implementation of the RTEP, which set down by the China's government and abided by pricing principle of RTEP

[82]. Such pricing principles mainly considered residential acceptance of price changing, which also means the RTEP have not actually improved residential electricity price raise. The reform of residential electricity still needs to achieve a signiﬁcant increase.

For supply side, RTEP improved residential electricity price overall and, to a certain extent, eased the deﬁcit of electric power enterprise in the ﬁeld of residential. However, the amount of income is mainly used for compensating the cost without proﬁts. To the problem of less proﬁt, Lin and Jiang [89] pointed out that the subsidies have directional problems. As a transition economy, the subsidies are necessary in the development process and rashly abolishing them may be harmful to the macro economic development. They suggested electricity subsidies should transfer from the demand side to the supply side.

(3) The price level was not fully reﬂecting regional diﬀerences The condition of vast land area and the population of many natural geographical restrictions create signiﬁcant imbalances in China's power supply and demand [72,90]. For the power supply perspective, the coal resources are mainly located in the north and west areas, wind power resources are mainly in coastal and western regions, hydropower resource is mainly in the southwest region. And from the view of electricity consumption, the southern, eastern and coastal areas, with the developed economy and large density population, has much demand than northwest [91]. The supply and demand imbalance phenomenon was a direct result of not uniﬁed tiered electricity price speciﬁc standard, so the provinces independently formulated their own applicable standards to tiered electricity price in the region, according to the local economic development and social environment factors. This method has fully considered the regional imbalance of economic development in China, but the process of the central government implementation was lack of macroscopic control and has no coordination communication between provinces. It relatively made the electricity price level of economy developed city been lower than less developed city.

The tiered electricity price in Gansu and Beijing is an example seen in Table 1. As a typical ﬁrst-tier city, the ﬁrst tier of residential electricity consumption in Beijing under 1 kV voltage level is 240 kW h per month and the electricity is 0.4883 CNY per kW h. However, in the signiﬁcantly less developed economic province Gansu, the 240 kW h per month was in the second tier of electricity consumption and the electricity is 0.560 CNY per kW h. At the same time if the economic level and the impact on electricity consumption were excluded, and the ﬁrst tier electricity price level is the only considered reason, the one of Beijing is below 23 regions as there are 29 regions executed tiered electricity price in China. Obviously during the implementation process of RTEP in China, the national electricity balance coordination was inadequate and the price did not reﬂect actual diﬀerences of regional economy levels.

(4) Less combination with other electricity form and special welfare form a single user. The current tiered electricity price of China is still in its early stages. The combination with other forms of electricity, especially with the dynamic electricity price form, and the portfolio forms application proportion of province are inadequate [92,93]. The current combination form are mainly including: joined wet season and dry season electricity price, which piloted in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces as rich application of hydroelectric power in southwest China; distinguished the season in south ﬁve provinces to stagger the summer peak electricity [92]. In addition, the TOU price was chosen in ﬁve relatively high economic developing level provinces and cities. For 29 provinces and regions executed tiered electricity price, the regions with non-combination tiered electricity price form are still more than half. Due to the factors of electrical equipment penetration rate and economic development level, the diﬀerence in electrical level between urban and rural areas is huge [94]. The rural electricity consumption is obviously lower than the city one. Lin and Jiang

[10] presented that as the increasing situation of the regional discrepancies of the income and consumption level between rural and urban residents, the tiered electricity price should also consider separating the price standard of urban and rural areas. And for the special user subsidies, China chooses to adopt a free tier on low-income households in the form of providing a small amount of free electricity monthly. The forms and objects of welfare are relatively unitary and should be considered on the basis of reference to other countries and regions of preferential policies of electricity price. The welfare objects can expand to the unemployed, elderly families referred to in the Hong Kong mode

[59], and special welfare should also be taking into consideration such as added holiday in the United States mode [60]. As the way to prevent the misuse of welfare, the subsidization could be used as the form of taking electricity price in proportion to preferential in ﬁrst tier [95].

(5) Lack of smart meter application level.

Smart meters was thought to be important supportive equipment of demand side management, which help to understand the user behavior analysis in micro perspective and prediction of electricity consumption volatility and trend [67,96]. Especially, the wide application of data mining technology in the power industry made power data, which collected by smart meters, helped to optimize the electricity pricing [97–99]. Martiskainen

[100] proved that smart meters has signiﬁcant inﬂuence to residents of electricity eﬃciency and can guide electricity behavior to make the users realize the unreasonable electricity consumption. Xu et al. [101] found that the eﬀect of smart meters for residential energy saving is remarkable, by analyzed the households smart meters sample of Shanghai, China.

The current application of smart meters in China was still under stage of alternative popularization. User data collection and analysis has not achieved universal coverage, which also limits the development of tiered electricity price from the technology. Recently, China is in the stage of smart grid construction. Smart meters as terminal equipment of the smart grid are rapidly promotion. State Grid Corporation of China had invite for bids

75.8869 million smart meters in 2012, up 12.17% from a year earlier, and accumulated to 184 million.

5. Conclusions

The tiered electricity price reform in China has been implemented for nearly four years and after this the China's government has promulgated a series of relevant policies and regulations to push forward the reform of electric power system. It has assisted and promoted the current tiered electricity price in positive way. This paper analyzes the basic principle of tiered electricity price in China and speciﬁc implementation process. It has a certain positive eﬀect to the current unreasonable price structure and the price level of China. But policy has also exposed many problems up to now. The problems was classiﬁed into ﬁve questions in this paper, including: misunderstanding of users still existence in the process of policy implementation; the basic principles for electricity prices in order to improve users' acceptance is not conducive to further increase in electricity prices; the current electricity price considered the regional diﬀerence is not reasonable enough; lack of combination with other forms of electricity price and the welfare for special users is too single; hardware equipment doesn’t have high level. At the same time, the three inﬂuence aspects of tiered electricity pricing were considered in this paper. Finally based on the analysis results, the development direction of future tiered electricity price in China shall include the following aspects:

In the trend of China's increasing electricity consumption with rapid economic development, the tiers mode of California classiﬁcation, with annual benchmark dynamic electricity consumption instead of the ﬁxed standard, should be considered as a future direction. It will make the grading standard more reasonable but also eﬃciency.

Besides the improvement of electricity consumption blocks, it also can distinguish by the quality of power supplying to change the electricity price structure. Chen and Wang [84] believed that diﬀerent demand of power supply quality will aﬀect their willingness to pay. It will be a developing direction of electricity price promotion by charging more electricity price to higher quality requirements users. Obviously, the power supply capacity and eﬃciency in China are also put forward new requirements.

The tiered electricity price combined with peak and valley time-ofuse electricity price has well applied in many countries for a long time. The allocation of power resources in time greatly improves the eﬃciency of power utilization. The application in 5 provinces of China has received the good eﬀect and it should be considered for wider use in the future. At the same time, it should also consider other forms such as seasonal electricity price combined with tiered electricity price.

From the perspective of the historical development of China's electric power reform, the adjustment of electricity price will be a gradual process [72]. Sun and Lin [15] pointed out that if China wants to achieve reasonable residential electricity price, a long-period reform process will be necessary. Lin and Jiang [10] also believed that the tariﬀ design should take the social stability, residential aﬀordable ability, energy eﬃciency and cost recovery into account and the electricity price reform wouldn’t achieve in a short term. The tiered electricity price is an important part of electric power reform in China. The diﬀerence of national conditions, social form and stages of development determines the tiered electricity price in the application and development of China, which should not copy the development model of other countries, but the reform will continue to proceed."
3,An empirical case study about the reform of tiered pricing for household electricity in China,"The reform of tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) in China was implemented nationwide in July 2012. The main purpose of the policy is to promote reasonable resource allocation and utilization. Based on the micro household-level survey data, this paper investigates the effect of the TPHE on achieving the twin objectives of efficiency and equity respectively. Results demonstrate that under the current scheme of the TPHE, the incentives for electricity conservation are effective and the distortion of cross-subsidies in electricity tariffs in China has been reduced. However, price sensitivities of household electricity demand across different income groups are influenced by various factors. Future policy should concentrate on the design and improvement of the TPHE to establish a comprehensive pricing mechanism. Meanwhile, complementary policies should be enacted to support the TPHE, which will be helpful for further improvement of the TPHE and the establishment of other pricing mechanisms of resource-products in the residential sector.","1. Introduction

The Chinese central government has announced to carry out energy price reform, which aims to establish a rational energy pricing mechanism and resolve issues of resource pricing and efﬁciency [1]. Energy price reform in China has recently reached a ‘‘critical” stage, because the reform object – the residential sector is quite sensitive [2]. In particular, the electricity pricing mechanism, which is closely related with resident life, attracts increasing attention from economist and policy makers. Based on the comprehensive opinion poll and rigorous analysis, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) proposed the tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) in China in November 2009. Under this pricing system, household electricity prices will be set in three tiers based on the volume of electricity consumption. Speciﬁcally, households who consume more electricity will be forced to internalize the costs of higher electricity consumption, while other households who consume less electricity will be left intact. The implementation of TPHE has two positive effects. First, the integration relation between electricity price and household electricity consumption will promote the efﬁciency of electricity consumption. Second, the TPHE makes sure that subsidies to electricity consumption would be distributed to the neediest people. In general, the TPHE not only stimulates the potential for residential electricity-saving, but also phases out untargeted energy subsidies that favor the rich rather than the poor. In 2014, the National Energy Bureau issued the energy work guidance, indicating that the reform of electricity sector would be further promoted. Since the attention to the sustainable development and social welfare is continuously growing, the pricing mechanism of electricity, which has to satisfy objects of both efﬁciency and equity, is on the top of the government’s agenda. Since the concern about the electricity pricing mechanism is continuously growing all over the world, the public investigation and analysis over the scheme, goals and effects of different electricity pricing mechanisms are abundant. Thus, we integrate some typical studies for comparison analysis (see Table 1). We can ﬁnd that many electricity pricing mechanisms are different, and each mechanism has different electricity tariffs. Filippini [3] analyzed the panel data of 40 cities in Switzerland during 1987–1990 and concluded that ‘‘Time-of-Use Electricity Rates” were more efﬁcient than the overall increase in electricity prices. Under same electricity pricing mechanism in Norwegian, Ericson [4] found that higher demand ﬂexibility tended to increase the propensity to select dynamic tariffs, while consumption patterns did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence tariff choice. Using time series data of Turkey during 1971–2006, Dilaver and Hunt [5] showed that price elasticity of residential electricity demand ranged from À0.10 to 0.57, while the elasticity of residential electricity consumption was between 0.41 and 2.29. Wang and Li [6] reported a survey of 43 Time-ofUse (TOU) pricing programs targeted industrial customers and offered by U.S. utilities, and examined various industrial scenarios to predict electricity cost savings when customers were facing the transition from ﬂat rates to TOU pricing. Erdogdu [7] analyzed the impacts of market reform on electricity prices and cross-subsidies in the electricity sector using panel data of 63 countries during 1982–2009. Results showed that the ﬁxed or consistent electricity market model couldn’t be adopted by different countries or regions, and the levels of electricity price and cross-subsidies should be decided by factors such as the national electricity consumption, income levels and regional characteristics. Chattopadhyay and Duﬂo [8] indicated that the cross-subsidization of electricity price in India was inefﬁcient and unsustainable, and proposed the corresponding reform plan. Upton et al. [9] provided information on electricity consumption change and costs on dairy farms through the simulation of various electricity tariffs, and how these tariffs interacted with changes in farm management. For most countries such as Norwegian, America and Japan, the TPHE (including time-differentiated tariffs and amount-differentiated tariffs) is a widely used mechanism in residential electricity sector.

It is not easy for the government to make a rational decision on residential electricity pricing, especially in China, which is experiencing a vital political and economic transition. A large number of empirical studies on the mechanism for residential electricity in China mainly focus on price sensitivities and subsidies.

Price sensitivities of residential electricity consumption are inﬂuenced by many factors, and one of the most important factors is household disposal income. Some macro factors (such as population growth and urbanization rate) and individual preference (such as lifestyle) also effect electricity consumption. Thus, Holtedahl and Joutz [10] discussed the inﬂuences of household disposable income, population growth, electricity price, rate of urbanization and temperature on residential electricity demand in Taiwan. Using the logit regression model, Wang et al. [11] analyzed the willingness and behavior of residential energy saving and concluded that the economic beneﬁts, consumption habits, social norms and policies had positive impacts on residential electricity saving in Beijing. The complex price sensitivities of residential electricity consumption required a non-linear pricing mechanism that could distribute electricity to the one who had higher demand, and the utilization efﬁciency would be improved. Lin and Jiang [12] showed that the single electricity price system couldn’t solve the complex social and environmental issues so that China should design the four-ladder increasing block electricity tariffs to promote equity and efﬁciency. In general, the TPHE provides

opportunities for households to choose the energy-efﬁcient lifestyle and thus encourages electricity saving.

A reasonable price mechanism is conducive to improving the effectiveness of subsidies and ensuring the equity of allocation. Under the former subsidy mechanism, most subsidies went to high-income residents [13] and it is urgent to reform the inefﬁcient cross-subsidies [14]. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the optimal allocation of cross-subsidies among different income groups.

The principal goal of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the TPHE policy. Speciﬁcally, there are four distinctive reasons for studying the effect of TPHE reform.

First, the nationwide TPHE reform in China, which is the reform of residential energy pricing for the ﬁrst time, would have an important impact on the energy consumption behavior of 1.4 billion people. In other words, household energy saving actions would likely be stimulated in this new integrated power tariff system. To our knowledge, the relative research rarely paid attention to the analysis of the reform effect about efﬁciency and equality. Since the reform features the inﬂuence on the behavior of microeconomic entities, we investigate the price sensitivity of different households, and evaluate the reallocation of the residential electricity subsidies. Therefore, studying the energy pricing reform of residential sector offers an opportunity to understand the revealed preference of household decisions about electricity use, and we contrast their choices with the goal of public policy makers.

Second, except for the household income which has been commonly considered in the previous research (e.g., [14]), our study introduces three variables related with the TPHE reform, and examines whether these variables have the signiﬁcant impact on the energy saving behavior. The ﬁrst one is the household energy expenditure. To optimize the household utility and minimize energy expenditure, households which have higher electric bills might be more sensitive to the TPHE reform, and would be more likely to take energy saving actions. The second variable is a dummy, which investigates whether households have installed solar water heaters before the reform. If households have already taken energy saving actions such as the installation of solar water heaters, they might be more motivated by the price reform. The third variable is also a dummy, which evaluates whether households understand the TPHE reform. In our study, we ﬁrst examine the relation between the policy understanding level and the policy effect, and then conduct a further analysis on the investigation of whether the relation varies among different income groups.

Third, in order to evaluate the actual effect of the policy, we use the data after the implementation of TPHE reform. Different from the advanced assessment in previous research of Lin and Jiang [12], we adopt the micro household-level survey data in 2013 and 2014, and quantitatively estimate the redistribution of residential electricity subsidies. The empirical results show that compared to the case before the reform, the TPHE reform not only improves the equality of subsidies allocation among different income groups, but also reduces 6.62% of subsidies to residential electricity consumption.

Fourth, our empirical analysis highlights the positive role of TPHE reform in the improvement of efﬁciency and equality, and provides answers to the debate about the efﬁciency of the implementation of the TPHE (e.g., [15,16]). In other words, the TPHE reform makes households more sensitive to energy price change, and provides incentives for households to take energy saving actions. However, the process of energy price reform in China is still slow. We argue that more targeted design of the TPHE should be promoted gradually and progressively to achieve the maximized efﬁciency and equity. In this paper, using the micro household-level data of nine provinces from China’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS) in 2013 and 2014, 1 we expand the research of Sun and Lin [14] and examine whether the policy led to a reduction in inefﬁcient energy consumption behavior by employing the linear probability model. In addition, this paper examines the equity of redistribution mechanism of electricity subsidies. To assess the magnitude of these changes, we employ a price-gap strategy and estimate the impacts of the TPHE on the reallocation of cross-subsidies after the policy.

The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the methodology. Section 3 provides data presentation. Section 4 evaluates efﬁciency of the TPHE. Section 5 evaluates equity of the TPHE. Conclusions and policy recommendations are provided in Section 6.

2. Methodology

2.1. The linear probability model (LPM)

In this paper, we discuss a binary outcome, and the household electricity consumption of discrete choice can be deﬁned to indicate whether households change energy-inefﬁcient behavior. The multiple regression model can be written as

Pðy ¼ 1jxÞ ¼ a 0 þ c 1 x 1 þ c 2 x 2 þ Á Á Á þ c K xK 

ð1Þ

where y is a binary variable; if y ¼ 1, it implies that more energyefﬁcient behavior is adopted by households after the implementation of TPHE; if y ¼ 0, it implies that households do not change their energy consumption behavior even if the TPHE reform has been implemented. x j denotes all of the explanatory variables. Eq. (1) shows that the responsibility Pðy ¼ 1jxÞ is linear in the parameters b j . In the linear probability model (LPM), b j ¼ @Pðy ¼ 1jxÞ=@x j , which measures the change in the probability of success given a one-unit increase in x j , holding other factors ﬁxed.

We can turn the estimated Eq. (1) into

Pðy ¼ 1jxÞ ¼ GðxbÞ   pðxÞ

CRECS, supported by China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, is a nationwide survey that carried out twice a year. The face-to-face survey focuses on the issues of household energy use, such as the household income, number of family members, energy consumption by type, electricity costs, gas costs and consumption of transport energy. The data used in this study is based on the surveys in July 2013 and January 2014.

where GðzÞ ¼ z is an identical equation, and satisﬁes 0 < GðÁÞ < 1 in the open unit interval for any z 2 R. Eq. (2) can be pulled by the general latent variable model when GðÁÞ is a cumulative distribution function (cdf), such as

where e is a continuous distribution variable and e and x are mutually independent with property that the probability density function (pdf) of e is symmetric. Then for any z 2 R, there exist, so we can obtain as it is showed in Eq. (2). In the Probit model, 

The Logit model is a speciﬁc form of Eq. (2) when the following condition is satisﬁed: 

We adopt both the Probit model and Logit model to estimate our outcome of interest.

where Y i is the dependent variable. Y ¼ 1 indicates that the households take actions to save energy or improve their electricity efﬁciency after the TPHE reform, while Y ¼ 0 implies that households do not change their electricity consumption behavior. The variable of ln income denotes household disposable income (after-tax income), ifknow refers to whether households understand the policy of the TPHE. If households understand the policy of the TPHE, then ifknow ¼ 1, otherwise, ifknow ¼ 0. bill is the expenditure of electricity (k ¼ 1), gas (k ¼ 2) and transportation (k ¼ 3). X indicates the control variables, e.g., scale of the households is denoted by num, the dummy of survey month is denoted by month (month ¼ 0 indicates the sample is from the survey in July 2013, and month ¼ 1 indicates the sample is from the survey in January 2014), and the dummy variable of ‘‘the installation of solar water heaters” is denoted by ifsol. Table 2 shows the main variables listed above and their deﬁnitions.

To interpret the estimates, a change in independent variable changes the probability of Y ¼ 1. If the independent variable x j is continuous, for example, x j ¼ ln income, then from Eq. (4), we can obtain

If the independent variable x j is binary, for example, x j ¼ ifknow, then from Eq. (4), holding other factors ﬁxed, we can get the partial effect of ifknow, If the independent variable x j is discrete, for example, x j ¼ num, then from Eq. (4), holding other factors ﬁxed, we can get the partial effect of num, 2.2. The price-gap approach

The former untargeted cross-subsidy mechanism of electricity consumption in China is lack of efﬁciency and equity. Under the former electricity pricing mechanism, most subsidies went to high-income people, implying that the rich was subsidized by the poor. By setting different electricity-pricing tiers, the TPHE modiﬁes the traditional model of cross-subsidies, reallocates the public resources and generates large budgetary savings.

Based on the study of Lin and Ouyang [17], we adopt the pricegap approach to estimate the scale of cross-subsidy in electricity price. The price-gap approach proposed by Corden [18] has been widely used by many researchers for analyzing the effects of energy subsidies. Firstly, we calculate the price-gap by the difference between the benchmark price and the terminal price. Then, using the constant elasticity demand function [19], this paper estimates the change in subsidy to residential electricity consumption. In order to highlight the impact of TPHE on subsidies change, we use the previous electricity price as a reference.

where elas stands for the price elasticity of demand for household electricity; Q 1 and P 1 denote the electricity demand and electricity price under the scheme of TPHE, respectively; Q 0 and P 0 represent the former electricity demand and electricity price, respectively. Therefore, DQ ¼ Q 1 À Q 0 measures the electricity consumption change before and after the implementation of TPHE.

3. Data presentation

This article uses the data of urban and rural households from the CRECS in July 2013 and January 2014. There are 2441 valid samples of households. The statistical description of survey data is shown in Table 3.2 

Results show that 40.7% households adopted energy-efﬁcient behavior after the implementation of the TPHE, indicating that the TPHE provides effective incentives for electricity saving. Similar results can be found in the study of Olmstead et al. [20]. The average residential monthly electricity bill is 130.25 CNY with a standard deviation of 102.06 based on our survey data. The average residential monthly gas bill is 49.56 CNY with a standard deviation of 42.66. The average residential monthly transportation bill is 446.79 CNY. Generally, energy bill is an important component of household expenditure, and bills of transportation and electricity occupy larger shares in total energy consumption expenditure. The average family members are 3.14 persons, which are in accord with the ﬁgures in the Sixth National Population Census of China (3.10).

Classiﬁcation of households that adopt energy-efﬁcient behavior after the implementation of TPHE is shown in Table 4. Surveyed households are classiﬁed into three groups according to the indexes of household annual disposable income, knowing about the TPHE and the installation of solar water heaters. It can be seen that compare with the low-income group, only 32.3% households, whose annual disposable income is higher than 98,889 CNY, have adopted more energy-efﬁcient behavior after the TPHE reform, implying that high-income group is relatively less sensitive to the TPHE policy. 43.8% households chose to save electricity when know about the implementation of the TPHE, indicating that the disseminating the TPHE policy is an important instrument to reduce residential electricity consumption. 47.0% households who have installed the solar water heaters before the TPHE reform, tend to choose an electricity-saving behavior. Results show that households who live an energy-efﬁcient life tend to save more energy than households in the other group.

4. Evaluation of efﬁciency

Based on the analysis above, feedbacks for incentives of the TPHE are distinct among families at different income levels. Some factors have positive effects on electricity saving, while others impede the improvement of energy efﬁciency. According to Eq.

(4), we analyze the major factors affecting household energy saving and evaluate the efﬁciency of the TPHE using the linear probability model. Our main estimation strategy employs the probit regression (Columns (1)–(3)). Table 5 reports regression results. In order to differentiate the effects of variables, 3 models are developed in this paper. Model (1) only considers variables of income, the installation of solar water heaters and knowing about the TPHE policy; on the basis of model (1), model (2) includes family demographic variables and dummy of survey month control; model (3) further includes households’ energy consumption bills. Columns

(4)–(6) in Table 5 report estimates using logit regression using the same strategy with probit regression models (1), (2) and (3).

As shown in Table 5, most regression results are signiﬁcant, indicating the robustness of the models. Under the mechanism of the TPHE, factors of household income, the installation of solar water heaters, knowing about the TPHE and family demographic variables signiﬁcantly impact household electricity-saving behavior.

Our results suggest that income has a negative impact on improving the energy efﬁciency, implying that there are lower probabilities for high-income households to save electricity. These results suggest that a ten thousand CNY increase in income will lead to a 0.7–1.4% reduction in the probability of households changing consumption pattern into energy conservation. The planned behavior-deﬁned as the installation of solar water heaters, which captures the potential for energy-aware-affect how households choose electric consumption pattern. Consistent with the results of Table 4, the relationship between installation of solar water heaters and probability of energy saving after the TPHE is signiﬁcant and positive. In terms of magnitude, we ﬁnd that introducing energy-saving appliances results in an increase in probability by roughly 20.7%. Knowing about the TPHE has a positive impact on household electricity saving. Households who know about the TPHE are 27–29% more likely to adopt energy-efﬁcient behavior. Wang et al. [11] also showed that the public awareness on electricity saving and environment protection promotes energy saving in the residential sector. Based on survey data, 13% of surveyed households are still unfamiliar with the TPHE, implying that the Chinese government needs to further promote the publicity of the reform policy.

Turning to the remaining control variables, we ﬁnd that the electric consumption bill and gas consumption bill have signiﬁcant effects on increasing the probability of energy saving (Column 3 in Table 5), suggesting that households with higher electricity consumption are more likely to develop an energy-saving living pattern. Namely, gas consumption is negatively related with electricity-saving since there is a signiﬁcant substitution effect between gas and electricity.

From the analysis above, the TPHE has improved efﬁciency by promoting household electricity conservation. In order to fully test different sensitivities to the TPHE pricing mechanism, design of the TPHE needs to be further improved, such as breaking down the policy of equal pricing in different income groups. Table 6 provides the marginal effect of knowing about the TPHE on probability of energy-saving across different income groups. The results in Table 6 suggest that there is smaller effect of knowing about the TPHE on the probability of energy-saving in relatively low income groups. However, as income rise above the ﬁrst tertile level of 60,000 CNY, the extent of impact of knowing about the TPHE on inclination of energy-saving rises markedly. The marginal effect of knowing about the TPHE then tapers off at higher income groups (100,000 6 income). As before, the middle income groups are mostly sensitive to TPHE after knowing about the TPHE and more possible to change their consumption behavior into energyefﬁcient pattern.

5. Evaluation of equity

The implementation of TPHE has a negative impact on household electricity consumption by improving the marginal cost of electricity. Besides, it also modiﬁes the untargeted subsidy mechanism to ensure that the poor receives subsidies. The consumption of electricity is often subsidized by the central government of China, which means that more subsidies would be allocated to the person who consumes more electricity. Under the former electricity pricing mechanism, high-income residents received most of subsidies while low-income residents received little subsidies. In general, the former untargeted cross-subsidy mechanism of electricity consumption in China is lack of efﬁciency and equity [17].

Due to the above reasons, this paper divides samples into three groups by income level and examines the impacts of the TPHE on the reallocation of cross-subsidies by price-gap approach. The result showed that the decreased amount of subsidy after the implementation of the TPHE was 25,658 CNY/month. Speciﬁcally, subsidies for the low income-low consumption group reduced by 3.65 CNY/mouth/household, while subsidies for the high incomehigh consumption group reduced by 27.18 CNY/month/household. From Fig. 1, under the new pricing scheme of TPHE, the share of subsidies of high-income residents declined 2.21%. On the contrary, the share of subsidies of low-income residents has improved 0.96%.

The result indicated that the implementation of TPHE helped to increase the relative subsidies for the low-income residents and reduce the total payment of subsidies. First, electricity consumption of households at low-income levels are almost in the ﬁrst electricity-price tier, thus they are less inﬂuenced by the relatively high price in the second and third tiers. Second, the absolute value of price elasticity of electricity demand is negatively related with income while is positively related with price [14]. The low price elasticity of high-income group indicates that high-income families pay more attention to the quality of life, so that the TPHE has little impacts on electricity saving behavior of high-income families.

In general, compared to the level pricing, the TPHE improved equity by making high-income households bear the cost of electricity price increases. The electricity price-gap between the industrial sector and the residential sector has decreased and the total cross-subsidy scale has declined. Besides, the reallocation of subsidies is more reasonable in terms of high-income families received fewer subsidies, while more subsidies went to low-income households. The implementation of the TPHE has brought positive effects to the social welfare and sustainable development. Considering that the pricing mechanism hasn’t achieved its full potential, the optimal level of each price tier needs further research [15]. Some studies indicate that the deregulation policy of government would contribute to the establishment of rational electricity-price and the optimization of consumer power consumption. Recent data revealed that, in fact, electricity prices were extremely variable and were much higher than the costs of generation. It is the latter characteristic of deregulated electricity-prices which is of particular interest to those who monitor the electricity markets for irregularities [21]. Considering that the TPHE in China is still in the initial stage, it is not possible to be comprehensively deregulated. Thus, we focus on how to set the optimal electricity-price tiers as well as the electricity-price in each tier to achieve the objectives of efﬁciency and equity.

6. Conclusions and policy recommendations

Energy price reform is regarded as one of the major policies to enhance the social equity and efﬁciency in many developing and transitioning economies. The TPHE is just the ﬁrst pilot step of residential energy price reform in China; future price reforms of natural gas and other public resources would possibly adopt the tiered pricing as well. Although the TPHE is conducive to improving efﬁciency and equity, the pricing mechanism still needs to be improved throughout the implementation process. Therefore, using micro household-level data from CRECS, this paper evaluates whether the TPHE achieves efﬁciency and equity and then suggests policy implications for decision makers.

The impacts of electricity price reform on residential electricity consumption behavior depends on several factors. First, it depends on the relative substitutability of different kinds of energy goods. Since gas is a good substitute for electricity, a higher gas consumption bill implies the willingness to reduce electricity consumption. Second, the effect on the magnitude of the reduction in overall electricity consumption depends on the publicity of policy and sensitiveness of households. The publicity is crucial to reduce the misunderstanding of ‘‘disguised price increases” and ease the tension between the reform policy and the general public. Furthermore, investigating the household price sensitivity is helpful to promote households to change the inefﬁcient and wasteful pattern of electricity consumption. Therefore, policy makers could use multiple media tools, such as television, internet, cellphone APP and the community advocacy to promote the comprehensive understanding of electricity price reforms.

Moreover, the TPHE not only reduces the cross-subsidization scale but also improves the reallocation of subsidies. It narrows the irrational electricity price-gap between the industrial sector and the residential sector and generates large budgetary savings the national subsidy expenditure decreased by 6.62%. The TPHE makes the subsidy mechanism more targeted by transferring subsidies from high-income households to low-income families.

Although the process of energy price reform in China is still slow, the future directions are clear. Analyses of the barriers as well as drivers of the reform provide a reference for policy makers to further promote the reform of energy pricing. Results of our paper show that, to a certain extent, the TPHE realizes the twin objects of efﬁciency and equity. However, establishing a fair and effective mechanism cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, in order to provide policy implications for decision makers, researchers need to make further research on drivers and barriers of energy price reform, explore the feasible path of reform and complementary policies to reduce uncertainty.

The Chinese government is suggested to promote the design of the TPHE gradually and progressively to achieve the maximized efﬁciency and equity. It can be expected that energy price reform would be further promoted to resource products in China, and in order to provide comprehensive implications for policy makers, studies such as the establishment of early warning mechanism, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the policy, and the enactment of complementary policies should be conducted to accurately grasp of the possible impacts of reforms and reduce the uncertainties of reforms."
4,Analyzing the elasticity and subsidy to reform the residential electricity tariffs in China,"The rapid and massive process of urbanization in China has made the energy consumption of the residential sector an important motivator in national energy consumption. As the most important part of household energy consumption, electricity and its demand-side management play fundamental roles when exploring the methods of energy reform in China. Based on the framework of household production theory, this paper estimates the elasticities of Chinese residential electricity from 2006 to 2016 by using the data of 286 cities, and the first difference generalized method of moment estimator is employed. The results show that the demand for residential electricity is inelastic to price and is mainly affected by total expenditure, price of appliance and temperature. We also find that factors impacting electricity consumption vary among regions, and the demand is elastic to price change with the samples of the lowest domestic product. With the elasticity we estimated, a Ramsey tariff is calculated and compared with the current tariff, and the subsidy for residential electricity consumption is also analyzed. Based on the results, we propose to raise the price appropriately, and suggest the implementation of diversified pricing schemes according to regional characteristics to control the consumption by realizing the price mechanism, and to promote energy-saving and emission reduction in the residential sector.","1. Introduction

Driven by the development of the economy and the improvement of people’s living standards, the electricity consumption of the residential sector in China has been growing rapidly in the past decades. In 2018, the total amount of electricity consumed by residents in China reached 968.5 billion kWh, with an increase of 10.4% compared with the previous year. 1 This large amount accounts for 14.2% of the total consumption of China in 2018. However, compared with the developed countries such as the US, whose household electricity consumption is 1378.65 billion kWh in2017, 2 the consumption level in China, especially the consumption per capita, is not high enough to reach its plateau.

Different from developed countries, the energy market in China has not developed to a phase in which the wholesale and retail price of power could be decided by the market itself (Ji, Li, & Sun, 2019; D.; Zhang & Ji, 2019). As an important strategic policy tool, the tariff is under control of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) for a long period of time, which leads to the loss of function of price in reﬂecting the costs of production and supply, and results in price distortions. China promoted a new round of reforms in electricity tariffs in 2005 with the targets of straightening out the electricity price and forming a transparent price mechanism. Even though in the process of reforming, the adjustment of the electricity tariffs in the residential sector is quite insigniﬁcant, especially when compared with the industrial and commercial sectors, both in its extent of variation and its frequency. However, residential consumption grows faster than other sectors, the consequence of the low tariff is that the value of electricity as a kind of resource cannot be reasonably reﬂected by the price, which is not conducive to resource conservation and environmental protection. In addition, the increasing consumption driven by the household income and the low price of residential electricity which is required for social welfare has inevitably led to a large number of cross-subsidies and socially unjust. In order to keep the household power price at a low level to guarantee the welfare of residents, the gap between the residential tariff and the long-term marginal cost of electricity should be compensated by other sectors and is usually paid by industrial and commercial end-users in China, which causes the problem of cross-subsidy. Lin and Jiang estimated the total subsidy as 356.73 billion CNY(Lin & Jiang, 2011), Lin and Liu estimated the cross-subsidy of 456.2 billion and 486.8 billion CNY of the year 2013 and 2015(Lin & Liu, 2016).

To deal with the serious problem of subsidy and the unfairness, a more active tariff for the household is required to improve the efﬁciency of power use and to promote fairness. In 2009, the NDRC put forwards a three-block increasing block tariffs (IBTs) for residential electricity in China and the policy was further implemented nationwide in June of 2012. According to the policy, the price for residential electricity is designed into three blocks: basic consumption, normal consumption, and luxury consumption. However, a large volume of electricity has been designed in the ﬁrst block with the lowest price, which covers a large proportion of users, and leads to an insufﬁcient effect in guiding the residents in the power market(Lin & Chen, 2018; Lin & Jiang, 2011; Xu, Wei, Ji, Wang, & Gao, 2019; Z.; Zhang, Cai, & Feng, 2017). The tariffs of residents in various provinces did not change much from 2006 to 2016, only after the implementation of the IBTs, the average electricity price increased slightly due to the increase in electricity consumption. Different from electricity prices, the electricity consumption per capita shows an escalating trend year by year (as shown in Fig. 1). For ordinary commodities, the price has a controlling or stimulating effect on demand. But for electricity, especially the residential sector, to understand whether the price policy can guide the demand side, estimating the elasticities is preliminary for the research.

To demonstrate the mechanism on the demand side, the elasticity of demand for residential electricity consumption is studied across the world. Zhu et al. analyzed the results of 103 papers and found that the short-term price elasticity of residential electricity ranged from À0.948 to 0.61, with the average value of À0.228, and the long-term price elasticity ranged from À4.2 to 0.6, with the average value of À0.577 (Zhu, Li, Zhou, Zhang, & Yang, 2018); Campbell estimated the long-term price elasticity of À0.82 for Jamaica residents by using the data from 1970 to 2014 (Campbell, 2018); Boogen et al. applied a dynamic model to study the electricity consumption of residents in Switzerland, and obtained the short-term and long-term price elasticity of À0.3 and À0.6, respectively(Boogen, Datta, & Filippini, 2017); Miller and Alberini analyzed the price elasticity of the US residential sector by using different data sources and estimation methods and found the elasticity ranged from À0.2 to À0.8 (Miller & Alberini, 2016); Okajima and Okajima estimated the price elasticity of residential electricity consumption in Japan by applying the dynamic panel and the short-term and long-term elasticity were À0.397 and À0.487 (Okajima & Okajima, 2013); Alberini and Filippini showed that the short-term and long-term price elasticity of residential electricity demand in the US were À0.1 and À0.7, with the data from 48 states (Alberini & Filippini, 2011). Substantial studies also provide conclusions on household electricity usage on the demand side in China. For example, by using the monthly data from 2007 to 2013, Hung and Huang analyzed the residential elasticity in Taiwan, and concluded that the short-term and long-term price elasticity were À0.451 and À1.130 for the summertime, while À0.819 and À1.270 for the non-summer time (Hung & Huang, 2015); Sun and Ouyang used the microdata from China’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey to estimate the price elasticity for household power usage and found it to be À0.387(Sun & Ouyang, 2016), while Du et al. concluded that the elasticity for the ﬁrst block in IBTs was-0.652 by using the same data set(Du, Lin, Sun, & Zhang, 2015).

From the evidence above, it can be seen that although there are enormous studies on the elasticity of energy consumption, the estimation of elasticity depends on the selection of models (static or dynamic) and the types of data (macro or micro), as well as the stages of economic and social development (growth or recession) and various backgrounds (Alberini & Filippini, 2011; Borozan, 2018; Cialani & Mortazavi, 2018; Ji, Xia, Liu, & Xu, 2019; Lin & Du, 2015; Lucia & Torr o, 2011; Nakajima & Hamori, 2010). Therefore, when making reference and comparison of existing data, we must pay special attention to the differences in its research background, which also puts forward the need for new research. This paper further explores the short-term and long-term elasticities of Chinese residents’ electricity demand based on the data of cities in China.

In the study of residential electricity demand, climatic factors and economic levels are important factors inﬂuencing residents’ preference in purchasing electricity as a good(Dilaver & Hunt, 2011)(Vesterberg, 2016), Okajima and Okajima, Fu et al. divided the integral sample into subsamples according to climate and estimated the elasticity for each subsample (Fu, Zeng, Feng, & Cai, 2018; Okajima & Okajima, 2013), Li, Silva, He and Reiner studied the price elasticity of energy demand of people with different income/consumption levels (Li, Yao, Yang, & Zhou, 2018; Silva, Soares, & Pinho, 2017; He & Reiner, 2016). Based on the integral sample, this paper will also divide the cities according to the climate and economic levels, to explore the impact of various factors on the residential electricity demand in different contexts.

Based on the existing literature, this study tries to explore the factors impacting Chinese residential electricity consumption, and contributes to the literature in several ways:

First, based on the household electricity demand model, which is developed on the basis of household production theory, the determinants of residential electricity demand are veriﬁed from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and the impacts of these factors are analyzed which in turn veriﬁes the rationality of the theory applied I this ﬁeld. Therefore, this theoretical foundation will provide a basis for the construction of the demand equation.

Second, by using the dynamic panel and the city-level data, and with a treatment on the endogenous problem, we estimate the short-term and long-term price elasticities of Chinese residents’ electricity demand and the heterogeneity of regions are considered. These subsamples will further explore the impacts of factors under various circumstances and would supply the policymakers with more targeted suggestions in regulating the electricity tariffs.

Third, based on the price elasticities obtained from empirical analysis, Ramsey pricing theory is applied in comparing the electricity prices among provinces. By the Ramsay approach, the optimized price is estimated, based on which the subsidy of Chinese residential electricity consumption is calculated. The optimized price will provide a reference for the formulation of electricity prices.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methods and data sources. Section 3 empirically estimates the elasticities and the impacts of other factors on electricity demand, Ramsey optimized price and subsidies are also analyzed in the section. Section 4 summarizes the main conclusions and puts forwards policy proposals based on empirical study. And the logic diagram is presented in Fig. 2.

2. Data and methodology

2.1. Methodology

2.1.1. Electricity demand model The electricity demand was well developed in the 1990s(Flaig, 1990), Filippini et al. extended the literature on the theory by using price/income and climatic conditions as explanatory variables (Filippini, 1999)(Labandeira, Labeaga, & L opez-Otero, 2012). 3 For the issues studied in this paper, families need to buy three kinds of goods from the market, which are electricity, alternative fuels, and capital equipment (household appliances for example), and families cannot obtain utility independently from any of these items. Therefore, it must combine these items to produce daily necessities. That is to say, households do not directly consume these items, but use them to produce a series of ﬁnal products and services, such as food, lighting, heating, etc. These products and services are called composite energy good(Q), while electricity, alternative fuels, and capital equipment are intermediate goods for household production. Using this basic framework of family production theory, we can get the composite energy good(Q), as is shown in Eq. (1): Adapting Filippini’s model(Filippini, 1999), the production function of composite energy good(Q) is dependent on household electricity consumption(E), alternative fuel(F), and the stock of household appliances(K). And the utility function for the household could be described as follow: Adapting Filippini’s model(Filippini, 1999), the production function of composite energy good(Q) is dependent on household electricity consumption(E), alternative fuel(F), and the stock of household appliances(K). And the utility function for the household could be described as Eq. (2) : where X denotes the numeraire good that directly yields a utility, and Z represent other characteristics that inﬂuence the household preferences. The household decision-making involves a two-stage optimization problem, the ﬁrst stage is the process of minimizing the costs of producing the composite energy good, which is shown in Eq. (3): where p_e, p_f, and p_k stand for the price of residential electricity, alternative fuel and stock of appliances, E, F, K denote the quantity of electricity consumption, alternative fuel consumption, and household appliances, and the cost function is shown in Eq. (4): Then we obtain the demand derived from inputs for electricity by Shepard’s lemma as in Eq. (5): In the second stage, households maximize their utility by deciding the quantity of composite energy goods and the numeraire good, subject to their budget or expenditure Y, as is illustrated in Eq. (6): The corresponding Lagrangian function is in Eq. (7): Then we obtain the demand function of Q by Eq. (8): And the demand function derived from electricity could be described as Eq. (9): It can be seen that the household’s electricity demand depends on the prices of electricity, alternative fuel, household appliances, total expenditure, and household characteristics. The family responds to price changes by adjusting the stock of appliances and the frequency of use. In the Long-term, the household might change the number of stocks or replacing new appliances with higher energy efﬁciency to adapt to the changes in price. While in the short term, most of them adjust the frequency of use. 

2.1.2. Electricity demand equation According to the household production function in 2.1.1, based on the assumption that the household electricity demand depends on electricity price, alternative fuel price, household appliance price, expenditure, household scale, and the climate condition, we use the logarithmic function to set the static model of residential electricity demand as follows: where E it is the residential electricity consumption per capita in the city i and in year t, FS it is the family-scale, CDD it and HDD it are cooling degree days and heating degree days, ε it is an error term. Since the independent variable and all explanatory variables are in logarithmic form, the coefﬁcient can be directly interpreted as elasticity. For details of variables, see Appendix A.

As is stated in 2.1.1, consumers make adjustments in capital stock to adapt the price change of goods under the constraints of total expenditure, in that way the long-term equilibrium is achieved. However, it is not easy for the capital stock to achieve a long-term equilibrium level, so the real electricity consumption is not exactly the same as the supposed consumption under long-term equilibrium. We assume that there is an optimal power demand, then there should be a convergent tendency of optimal level and real demand between two adjacent periods under an ideal condition. That is to say, the change in demand lnE t À lnE tÀ1 is simply the difference between the optimal demand under long-term equilibrium ln E t * and the actual demand of the previous period lnE tÀ1 multiplied by a coefﬁcient δ between 0 and 1(Shen, 2014), described as follow: Using Eq. (10), we can rearrange Eq. (11) as follows, where βs stand for the long-term elasticity: By rearranging Eq. (12) and inserting a statistical error term ε it , we get: where, 0 < δ < 1, β Ã s stand for the short-term elasticity, repressors are logarithmic in the mode so the coefﬁcients could be directly interpreted as elasticities. The long-term elasticity can be obtained from dividing β Ã by δ, and δ could be obtained by subtracting the estimated coefﬁcient of lnE i;tÀ1 from 1.

To avoid the dynamic panel bias, the generalized methods of moment (GMM) estimator is used in this study. To test whether the ﬁrstdifference GMM (FD GMM) or system GMM (SYS GMM) estimators are more suitable for the data in our study, we use unit root test to see whether the dependent variable has a near unit root property. We choose the Fisher ADF unit root test for that they hold the assumption of the individual unit root process in each cross-section series and is quite suit for the situation in China. And the result of the test is that the dependent variable E does not have a unit root at the conﬁdence interval of 95% and 99% with and without a time trend. Therefore, to avoid the problem raised by the initial condition in SYS GMM estimator when the time series is not long enough, 4 we utilize the FD GMM estimator, and the equation can be obtained as: 

2.2. Data description The empirical study of this paper is processed based on the annual data of China’s 286 cities from 30 provinces (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Tibet are excluded) from 2006 to 2016. The main alternative energy for electricity in Chinese households is natural gas, coal, and coal gas whose price data is not available, and the natural gas price has changed greatly in the past 15 years for the sake of policy changes rather than the compel of market, so the price index of water and fuel is used as the proxy variable of the price for residents’ alternative fuel. Similarly, owing to the lack of the actual price of household appliances at the city level, the index of the household appliance is used as the proxy variable of the price for residents’ capital stock. The Residential electricity consumption, resident population, expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, index of household appliance, and price index of water and fuel are all from China’s macroeconomic database of CEIC, and the data sources are the National Bureau of Statistics of China; data of Price for residents’ electricity consumption are from WIND database, and the data souse is “China Electricity Tariffs Analysis Yearly Report”. To eliminate the effect of inﬂation on variables, expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, Price for residents’ electricity consumption, index of household appliance, and the price index of water and fuel are adjusted to the basic year of 2006. For the lack of electricity price in a speciﬁc year, we supplement the data by averaging the prices of the previous year and the next year based on the stability of residential tariff in China; for the incomplete data of the resident population, we supplement by regressing the relationship between the resident’s population and the registered population based on their high correlation. Given that the electricity consumption per capita of some cities is signiﬁcantly lower than the national average, in order to control the data quality, the data under 5% and greater than 95% are excluded. Table 1 shows the speciﬁc description of the variable.

The possibility of omitted variables bias has been reduced in order to obtain an accurate estimation. Since the electricity tariff in China is determined by the government, the variable of price seems to be strictly exogenous. However, the only data we can achieve is the average value of each province which is calculated by dividing the revenue of electricity sales by the quantity. However, the IBTs means that a higher demand induces a higher average revenue, and thus a higher average price, this introduces an endogenous problem. That is to say, the changes in electricity consumption E will have an inﬂuence on the price p e, acting as reverse causality. Previous pieces of literature tend to either ignore this endogenous issue or use the price of the next year to overcome the issue, or otherwise use the cost for power generation as the instrumental variable(Burke & Abayasekara, 2018; Gonz alez-Eguino, 2015). With the consideration of the data availability, we instrument the electricity price by the average price paid by residents in the other 29 provinces, following the method of Burke et al.(Burke & Abayasekara, 2018; Burke & Kurniawati, 2018).The instrument variable (IV) approach is utilized based on the following reasons: ﬁrstly, electricity tariff in all provinces are ofﬁcially determined and subject to similar extra impacts and price shocks, if any; secondly, the trading across regions is initially planned by governors in China, this background will satisfy the assumption of this IV approach that the tariff changes in one region has no inducing effect towards electricity leakage across regions. Fig. 3 provides an overview of the inverse relationship between residential electricity price and our instrument.

We use the Hausman method to test the endogeneity of p_e, the results reject the null hypothesis that “all explanatory variables are exogenous” at a 5% signiﬁcant level, which means that p_e is considered to be an endogenous variable, thus we reject the null hypothesis of “weak instrumental variables”, and Durbin-Wu Hausman test is also utilized with the results that p ¼ 0.0228, and the endogeneity of p_e is conﬁrmed. We then use Kleibergen-Paap rk LM statistic and Kleibergen-Paap Wald rk F statistic to test the under-identiﬁcation and weak-identiﬁcation of our IV(Elliott, Sun, & Zhu, 2019), the null hypotheses which are that the matrix is not full column rank and the weak correlation between endogenous variable and instrument. The rejection of the null hypothesis for under-identiﬁcation with a large F statistic for Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald that exceeds the Stock-Yogo weak ID test critical values suggests that our instrument is valid. 3. Empirical study

3.1. Elasticities with the full sample of China

After the Hausman test, we use the ﬁxed-effects model to analyze the panel data, the results are represented in Table 2. Column 1 describes the regression results without considering endogeneity, while Column 2 and Column 3 represent the results of static models with IV by using the GMM estimator, where Column 2 includes only the core variables. The signs of the coefﬁcients are exactly consistent with our expectations.

To cope with the endogenous issue, we applied the IV in the dynamic models. We initially establish a regression of endogenous variable p_e and p_e_iv based on OLS, obtaining a ﬁtted value of the regression named Pe_hat; then we substitute p_e with Pe_hat in the dynamic model in Eq (13), by using the FD GMM estimator, from what we have the results of Column 4 and Column 5, while Column 4 includes only the core variables. The results of the test for serial correlation and Sargan test for over-identifying restrictions tell that there is no signiﬁcant second-order serial correlation, which indicates the validity of the lag order of the instruments in our model.

In Column 5, the estimated coefﬁcient of the price for residents’ electricity is À0.233, indicating a reverse relationship between electricity tariff and the consumption, and the price elasticity is À0.233, which means an increase of 10% in tariff will induce a decrease of 2.33% in consumption. The estimated coefﬁcient of expenditure is 0.512, which means that the short-term expenditure elasticity is

0.512. Then the long-term price elasticity for residents’ electricity demand could be calculated by the estimated coefﬁcient (which is

0.417) of E t-1 as À0.40 (À0.233/(1–0.417) ¼ -0.400), and the long-term expenditure elasticity is 0.878 (0.512/(1–0.417) ¼ 0.878). The coefﬁcient of household appliance is À0.535, the absolute value which is higher than the price elasticity, indicating that the price signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the decision of electricity consumption for the households, which means that the decrease in costs and sale prices in household appliances is playing an important role in the upward movement of residential electricity consumption as in accordance with the family production theory. The household power usage does not respond to the price change for residents’ alternative fuel at a signiﬁcant level. That could be explained by the current situation that electricity is essential in household energy consumption, and is not replaceable by other fuels at present. The cooling degree days as well impacting the demand signiﬁcantly with an estimated coefﬁcient of 0.071, illustrating the impact of high temperature on power consumption, this adds evidence to the argument that air conditioning is one of the most initial faces in household electricity consumption. To further explore the factors impacting the demand–side decisions, the full sample is divided into groups according to certain thresholds in the following work.

3.2. Elasticities and economic levels

Economic development is an important factor in power consumption (Chang, 2014; Dong & Hao, 2018; Lee & Chiu, 2013; Shi, 2019; Ye, Koch, & Zhang, 2018). In this section, we divide the cities into 5 quantiles according to the GDP per capita in 2016 and named as G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5 from the lowest to the highest in GDP. 5 Given that extreme value under 5% and above 95% are excluded, the number s of cities in each quantile are not exactly the same. Table C. 1 in Appendix C represents the details of each group. Estimated results by using the FD GMM estimator are listed in Table 3, and test for serial correlation in the second order and over-identifying restrictions are all passed, which indicates the validity of lag order of the instruments in our model. As is shown in the results, the residential electricity demand in every quantile is affected by the temperature, and this is especially true in the cities of medium and high economic level, for example, in the G3, G4, and G5, the demand for electricity is not only affected by the cooling degree days, but also by the heating degree days, which indicates that the power consumed by air conditioners play an important role in the residential power demand in the cities with relatively high income. For the quantiles of G4 and G5 with a high level of GDP, the price for the household appliance is also an essential factor in electricity use: the rise in the price for a household appliance in these two quantiles have a negative impact on the consumption of electricity for residents. One possible explanation is that the purchasing rate of energy-efﬁcient appliances is climbing in recent years in areas of higher economic level (Wang, Wang, & Guo, 2017). As the purchasing rate of energy-efﬁcient home appliances whose price is higher than ordinary appliances increases, energy efﬁciency is increased in this way, which in turn reduces power consumption. It can be seen from the coefﬁcient of p_f that only the cities with the lowest economic development will switch to other energy sources instead of electricity and change the structure of living energy consumption when the price for other fuels changes. But for most Chinese residents, electricity consumption in life is irreplaceable. By comparing the results of each group, it can be seen that the relationship between electricity consumption demand and electricity tariff is more obvious in cities with low economic development level, for example, the price elasticity of G1 with the lowest GDP per capita (1.013) is greater than that of G2 (0.729) and much higher than the national average (0.233). The result is consistent with previous studies, which claim a more developed region corresponds to a lower price elasticity (Charlier & Kahouli, 2019; Okajima & Okajima, 2013; Sun & Lin, 2013). That is to say, the present tariff does have some directive function in the power consumption of relatively poor residents, but for the households in a higher level of living, the tariff is not functional.For cities of relatively high economic level, the impact of price on demand is not signiﬁcant; for middle-level cities (G3), both expenditure level and climatic factors have greater impacts on household electricity demand, that is to say, relative to other regions, household power usage in middle-level cities is more susceptible to spending levels, while in the low-income regions the electricity usage is expenditure-inelastic for its characteristics as necessity.

3.3. Elasticities and climate

Residents’ electricity consumption is also affected by climatic factors (Burillo, Chester, Pincetl, Fournier, & Reyna, 2019; Kung, Zhang, Choi, Xiong, & Yu, 2019). In order to further explore the residential electricity demand under different climatic conditions, we divide the national sample into ﬁve climate zones according to the” Thermal Design Code for Civil Building” (GB50176) of China as: extremely cold region, cold region, seasonal region, warm region and temperate region, which are marked as T1 to T5 in this paper. Table C.2 in Appendix C represents the detailed classiﬁcation and descriptive statistics for the data.

The FD GMM estimator is used to estimate the parameters, and the results are shown in Table 4. In the cold region (T2) and the seasonal region (T3), the expenditure elasticity is statistically signiﬁcant, and the short-term elasticity is 1.047 for T2 and 1.037 for T3, and the long-term elasticity is calculated as 1.548 for T2 and 1.217 for T3. As to expenditure elasticity, both the short-term (À0.389) and long-term (À0.571) values in the extremely cold region (T1) are inconsistent with the full sample and other regions in sign. One explanation is that extremely the cold cities in China are more likely to purchase efﬁcient energy equipment, which is higher in expenditure and consume less power. And this could be further convinced by the signiﬁcantly negative effect of p_k on E, which means the higher the price for household appliances, the more energy-efﬁcient the equipment would likely be, or few appliances would be purchased, both of this will give rise to the shrinking in electricity consumption. Only in the warm zone (T4), the self-price elasticity of residential electricity is signiﬁcant, and the short-term and long-term price elasticity is similar (À0.784 and À0.747 respectively). By observing the data of T4, we ﬁnd that the number of cooling degree days in the area is much higher than in other climate zones (see Table C. 2 in Appendix C). Also, as is shown in Fig. 4, cities belong to T4 are mainly located in the central and eastern parts of China, where the electricity tariffs are relatively high (beyond 15% higher than the north, west, and northwest). This indicates that higher tariffs are more likely to affect residents’ consumption behavior, which may also give rise to the statistical signiﬁcance of price impact in T4; the electricity consumption of residents in T4 is also affected negatively by the price of household appliances, indicating that the power consumption in the warm regions may be related to the purchase and use of appliances for cooling. Despite the T4 zone, electricity demand in the extremely cold zone (T1) and seasonal zone (T3) are also affected by the price of household appliances. For the cold region (T2), the heating degree days in imposing a positive effect on power demand because some cities belong to the zone are located south to the central-heating line, 6 the need for household heating in these areas contributes to the residential power demand. We can conclude that the inﬂuencing factors of household electricity consumption under different climatic conditions are inconsistent. In both terms of expenditure elasticity and price elasticity, the long-term elasticity is greater than the short-term elasticity in most zones. Only the short-term price elasticity of the warm area (T4) is almost the same as the long-term value which indicates that the price change in this region can trigger a demand response that is consistent with its long-term equilibrium in a short period of time, indicating that the impact of price changes on consumer demand is both signiﬁcant and rapid.

From Fig. 4, T3 zone, which includes the largest number of cities, represents speciﬁc characteristics in terms of geography: T3 cities located in West China are more likely to be underdeveloped, the number of cities in G1 and G2 with the lowest GDP contributes to a proportion of 69.6% in the western T3 cities. On the contrary, eastern T3 cities are more developed, with a proportion of 59.3% contributed by the G4 and G5 groups. To avoid the bias induced by the heterogeneity of the sample, we divide the T3 zone into two groups according to the geographic location and mark them as eastern sample and western sample, the results are shown in Table 5. Belonging to the same climate zone, the western sample shows a statistically signiﬁcant price elasticity; while in the eastern sample, the price for household appliances affects the demand more obviously. That is to say, even under the same climate condition, the factors impacting the residential electricity demand are not always the same due to other conditions such as economic development.

3.4. Ramsey tariff and subsidies

3.4.1. Ramsey tariff Consumers with different income vary in sensitivity to price changes, based on this assumption, the Ramsey approach is a pricing method of inverse elasticity pricing rule which means that users with lower price elasticity are charged a higher price, and vice versa, to subsidize the ﬁxed cost and maximize the total social welfare. With the combination of cost on the side of producer and the consumer willingness on the demand side, the Ramsey approach has been widely utilized in quasi-optimal pricing of the public utilities for its indicating function in the ﬁeld of differential pricing which is often considered as a method most beneﬁcial to the social welfare.

Actually, the Ramsey approach has been replaced by other pricing rules in recent research by including more information on demand and supply sides such as line limit, trader’s collaboration and many other determinants of electricity consumption(Sueyoshi, 2010). However, up to now the available data on China’s electricity trading arrangements is too limited to conduct a more complex approach. Therefore, given the advantage of Ramsey inverse elasticity pricing approach compared to the ﬂat pricing, we propose the method in our research.

The core idea of the Ramsey approach is to maximize the social welfare subject to budget balance (to meet the balance of income and expenditure of monopoly enterprises), the target equation can be expressed as: where CS and PS represent the sum of the consumer surplus and producer surplus, E i and p i stand for the power consumption and tariff of the consumer group i, and C(Ei ,...,En ) denotes the cost for power supply. We obtain the Ramsey pricing formula by the Lagrange equation of Eq. (14) and the derivation of E i : where β ei is the price elasticity of consumer group i, MC is the marginal cost, and λ is the Lagrange multiplier; then 1þλ λ is deﬁned as the Ramsey index, and is denoted by R, which is supposed to be equal to each other among different consumer group.

We assume that the price elasticity is constant for simplicity as in Eq. (17): from integration we get: where k i denotes the scaling term for consumer group i.

In addition, the constraint of the Ramsey approach is to keep the balance of total revenues and costs of the power supply enterprises, then we obtain the function for ﬁxed cost F by Eq. (19): We can calculate k i by the data of E i , p i and the price elasticity β ei , and analyze R by Eq. (18), with the Ramsey index R, Ramsey tariff could be calculated as follow, which is obtained from Eq. (15): Due to the availability and the inconsistency of statistical resources, and considering the uncertainty of the marginal cost of power supply in China’s power grid enterprises, this paper assumes that the marginal cost of the power supply is the short-term marginal cost, and the marginal cost of each consumer group is equal in the short term. Referring to the “China Electricity Tariffs Analysis Yearly Report”, we use the average price of the purchased electricity in 2016 as the marginal cost of power supply, which is 0.371 CNY/kWh. In China, for the sake of the welfare, the tariff of residential electricity is lower than the marginal cost of power supply, and the gap is compensated by the normal industrial and commercial (IC) sectors in the form of cross-subsidy. By using the price elasticity of À0.233 for residents’ electricity demand estimated in 3.1, and referring to the elasticity of À0.413 for industrial electricity consumption estimated by Chen and Zuo (Chen Yongjun, 2018), based on the data of power generation and tariffs of the year 2016 in China’s 29 provinces except Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang (as is shown in Fig. 5), we calculate the present Ramsey indexes for     residential and IC sectors of each province by the equation of R ij 7 ¼ ðP ij À MC i Þ=P ij *   E ij   , and the results are shown in Fig. 6.

The Ramsey indexes of different sectors in the same region are supposed to be equal, however, this is not true currently. A wider gap of Rs between two sectors means that the tariffs are further form balance(Nahata, Izyumov, Busygin, & Mishura, 2007). From Figs. 5 and 6, we can tell the correlation between the indicators of P and R, which means a wider gap in tariffs will to some extent lead to a wider gap in Ramsey Indexes. For example, the values of R ic are relatively high in Beijing, Tianjin and Qinghai province, and the ratio of Ric /R r in Beijing achieves 9 and serves as the highest in the country, partly because that P ic in Beijing is on top of China and P r is at the average level. However, this relationship changes with conditions. For the western region, the values of R ic are generally higher, while the gaps of prices are not at a high level, this is mainly because the low-level marginal costs for power supply in the western region thanks to the power resource endowment such as hydro, for example, the cost of power supply in Yunnan province, who serves the cheapest power, is 0.233CNY/kWh, equals to only 52.6% the cost in Beijing and Guangzhou, and the Ramsey indexes are relatively high in these provinces for the low marginal costs.

By Ramsey tariff approach, we will discuss a relatively optimal price for residents’ electricity use, to better adapt to the rounds of tariff decrease in the IC sector and to release the burden of the national revenue.

We assume that the total amount which consists of residential power sales and IC power sales are able to cover the marginal cost of power grid enterprises (0.371CNY/kWh) without subsidies from other departments. Then we use the price elasticity for residential electricity demand of À0.233, and À0.431 for IC sector, we also use the national average price for the household in 2016 of 0.584CNY/ kWh, and 0.817 CNY/kWh for IC, and the consumption for residents of 842.1 Â 10 9 kWh, and 4002.6 Â 10 9 kWh for IC.We obtain the Ramsey index of 0.177 by Eq (15) and Eq (16), and then calculate the Ramsey tariff of 1.546CNY/kWh and 0.629CNY/kWh for residents and IC by Eq (20).

 3.4.2. Price-gap approach Price-gap approach is considered as one of the most practical methods in calculating energy end-user subsidies for its simplicity in conception and analyzing(Coady et al., 2010; Corden, 1957; Lin & Jiang, 2011). The fundamental idea of the approach lies in that subsidies lead to lower end-user prices of energy and a larger amount in consumption, which could be described as follows: And the quantity of subsidy could be calculated as: Here, E 0 and E 1 are the quantity of consumption before and after removing subsidy, P 0 and P 1 are the price before and after removing subsidy, β is the Long-term price elasticity.

With the Ramsey tariffs, the long-term price elasticity of residential electricity demand and the average sale price announced by the National Energy Administration of China in 2016, by using the price gap approach of Eq (21), we obtain the supposed electricity usage if the Ramsey tariffs are implemented, and then ﬁgure up the total subsidy and cross-subsidy at present price level by using Eq (22), and the results are listed in Table 6:

The ﬁrst column of data under P 0 in Table 6 represents the current average electricity price and residential electricity consumption on the national level; the second column is the Ramsey electricity price and electricity consumption if the tariff is adjusted, and the subsidy calculated in this column is considered as the total subsidy of residents’ electricity consumption; in the third column we discussed the condition that if the price is adjusted to the average sales price of electricity in all sectors of China in 2016 of 0.615CNY/kWh, and the amount of subsidy, in this case, can be deﬁned as the amount of cross-subsidy (Li et al., 2018). The increase in tariff tends to reduce the number of subsidies through two channels: the price and demand. When the unit electricity price is adjusted to the Ramsey optimal price, the total electricity consumption of residents will be reduced from 842.10 Â 10 9 kWh to 556.32 Â 10 9 kWh. The increase in price and the decrease in demand will both reduce the number of subsidies; similarly, even if the current tariff is merely raised to the average sales price, the cross-subsidies that accounted for 0.04% of the country’s GDP can also be eliminated.

4. Conclusion and policy implication

4.1. Main conclusions

Using the data of cities in China from 2006 to 2016, and applying the dynamic panel, this paper estimates the demand equation of residents’ electricity and examines the inﬂuencing factors of demand. The main conclusions drawn are stated below:

(1) Price elasticity. The results indicate that the residents’ electricity demand is inelastic to price at the national level. But the price factor does signiﬁcantly affect the demand in relatively underdeveloped areas (G1 and G2). Especially in the cities with the lowest GDP(G1), the household electricity demand is elastic to the price, and is also affected by alternative energy price, indicating that families in poor areas are more sensitive to tariffs. Even in the same climate zone, the western cities are affected more by the tariff. These results are pointing to a possible conclusion that it is the economic development that decides if the tariff matters or not to the residents’ behavior towards electricity consumption.

(2) Factors impacting demand. China’s residential electricity demand is also affected by expenditure levels, household appliance prices, and climate factors, but the inﬂuencing mechanism varies according to economic levels and the tendency seems to be obvious from G1 to G5: the expenditure, household appliance price, and low temperature only have signiﬁcant effects on power consumption in the afﬂuent societies, while in the cities with low GDP the tariff plays a role of more importance. According to our results, it is worth noting that the demand for heating appears to affect more than cooling in summertime in the cold cities of T2, and in the regions of more demand in cooling (T4), the price impact is more signiﬁcant. That is to say, in designing the residential electricity tariff, the special demand for heating and cooling, especially the cities without central heating facilities served as infrastructure, should be taken into account, and energy-efﬁcient equipment is performing a role in reducing power consumption.

(3) Optimal tariffs and subsidies. The current residential electricity tariff is at a far lower level than it is supposed to be for the sake of total welfare. The calculated Ramsey optimal tariff for residents is almost 3 times the current price. If the tariff is adjusted to such a level, up to 400 billion CNY of subsidy could be eliminated, and the burden of 33 billion CNY for the normal industrial and commercial sector, which is used to be served as cross-subsidy could be released.

4.2. Policy implications

According to the conclusions above, this paper argues that:

Firstly, up till now, the IBTs has not performed as expected in the reform. By broadening the blocks, the government and the grid enterprises might ﬁnd access to a new subsidizing method, in which the higher-income residents subsidize the lower-income ones. This new method will not only continue to protect “lifeline” people by non-proﬁt power service, but also will balance the costs of power supply after the reduction of normal industrial and commercial electricity tariff, and even will promote the resource redistribution.

Secondly, the main inﬂuencing factors of residents’ electricity demand in different regions of China are not exactly the same. And the optimal tariffs are different due to the heterogeneity in power resource endowments and the pricing elasticities. Therefore, diversiﬁed pricing methods according to local conditions are suggested to function the price as a market signal and to impel market-oriented reforms.

Thirdly, serious cross-subsidy not only distorts the price signal but also hinders the process of the power market reforms. Although it is not realistic to completely eliminate cross-subsidy in the short term, as the economic level in China and the electricity demand of residents are both on the track of gradual increase, it is feasible to ﬁgure out a way of cutting down the quantity and clarifying the routes of subsidy, which is absolutely not clear up to now.

Finally, energy-efﬁcient equipment should be further promoted in the reduction of energy saving, especially in wealthy regions.

The demand for China’s residential electricity is inelastic, especially in the higher-income cities, the consumption is not even affected by price factors. Therefore, appropriate rising in the tariff can promote the function of price in reﬂecting the value of energy resources, and raise the efﬁciency by reducing excessive consumption. There is still space before the proportion of residential electricity consumption touching the ceiling, so the effective control and guidance on the consumption are of great signiﬁcance to the energy conservation and emission reduction targets in the incoming developing stage."
5,Application value of energy storage in power grid: A special case of China electricity market,"With the increase of renewable energy permeability and the development of distributed grid, energy storage plays an increasingly important role in the power system. A lot of studies have shown that energy storage can already be economically feasible. However, most previous studies concentrated on the value of energy storage in the free electricity market. In China, the power grid monopolizes the process of electricity transmission, distribution and retail, and the feed-in tariff and retail prices of electricity are regulated by government. It is difficult to analyze the application value of energy storage for China's electricity due to the lacking of data. The major contribution of this paper is to evaluate the application value according to the data of a provincial power grid. The results support the argument that energy storage can generate positive returns. The optimal storage capacity and operational strategy are also discussed in this paper.","1. Introduction

In 2016, China's electricity consumption was 5219 TW-hours, accounting for one-fourth of the world's electricity consumption. With the rapid economic growth, electricity consumption also maintained an upward trend. In response to the incensement of electricity demand, power grid investment also maintained rapid growth. The power system design is load-following, that is, the power supply terminal needs to be adapted to the demand. Due to the volatility of electricity demand, grid investment often retains greater redundancy. In recent years, the amount of investment in the power grid even exceeded the amount of power investment. Considering that the share of electricity consumption in the tertiary industry and household consumption in China is still increasing, and that the proportion of unstable renewable energy sources is also rising, the grid operation will face more challenges in the future.

Energy storage system (EES) is considered as an important technology to enhance the ﬂexibility of power systems, transferring loads and reducing the cost of power grids [1,2]. Currently, more than 99% of the energy storage capacity is large-scale energy storage devices such as pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES), which accounts for 3% of the global generating capacity [3]. In recent years, with the decline of battery cost, the battery energy storage (BES) has become to receive widespread attention [4]. The BES has the advantage of high energy conversion efﬁciency, especially for some battery such as lithiumion battery can reach 94% conversion efﬁciency [5]. In addition, the BES is always applied in the distributed energy storage (DES), which can be distributed allocated on the demand side and reduce the grid reinforcement investment.

Most of the current research of ESS applications is focused on the free electricity market. The applied value of energy storage is mainly derived from price arbitrage [6]. However, China's electricity market is a typical regulated market whose electricity price is regulated by government [7]. So it is difﬁcult to obtain the true marginal cost of electricity and assess the value of energy storage.

The major contribution of this paper is to evaluate the application value of energy storage in China according to the load data of a provincial power grid. We estimate the revenue of energy storage from the reduction of grid reinforcement and peak load shift. Considering that the operating mode of the ESS will affect the investment return, we apply the dynamic programming method to address the optimal storage capacity and operational strategy. The results of the relevant analysis can provide useful information for regulators and grid companies to arrange energy storage conﬁgurations more reasonably.

It should be note that we only consider the application of battery energy storage which is allocated on the terminal side in this paper. Some other storage technologies such as pumped storage and compressed-air energy storage are not included. Due to the limitation of the data, we can only provide a preliminary calculation for the allocation value of energy storage in China's power grid. However, we still believe the result might be useful for the policy maker and stakeholders.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy reviews the application of energy storage in the power grid and the method to solve the optimal operation mode of ESS. Section 3 gives an overview of the status of China's electricity market, and presents the optimal storage model for the regulated market. Section 4 describes the result and examines the inﬂuence of exogenous variables. Conclusions, as well as policy implications, are drawn in Section 5.

2. Literature review

The electrical system is a complex system which needs to be analyzed by using techniques from complexity science [8]. The permeability improvement of intermittent renewable energy and the proportion increase of household and commercial in the electricity consumption structure may threaten the reliability of grid, and increase the operational cost of conventional power systems. The energy storage is a key section to deal with these challenges [9].

The adoption of ESS can bring a number of high-value applications for the power grid [5,10], and increase the total social surplus [11,12]. ﬁgured out that the role of ESS can be recognized either on the generation side or the demand side, and providing the ancillary services for the power grid. These advantages include [1]:

On the supply side, ESS can improve the power grid's ability to absorptive renewable energy [13e15], reducing investment and operating costs of power supplies [16,17] and bringing down the peak feed-in tariffs [18].

On the demand side, ESS enables the consumer implement the demand side management [19,20], conduct price arbitrage [21,22] and deploy distributed photovoltaic systems [23].

Energy storage is also of great value in grid systems [24]. The ESS can enhance the reliability of grid, and making more efﬁcient use of the network [25], eliminate peak-valley gap and smooth the load [26] and improve the operation efﬁciency of the power grid [27,28].

In recent years, a lot of researches are focusing on economic viability and optimal scale of energy storage [21] estimated the economic viability of energy storage in US electricity market and calculate the proﬁt-maximizing size. The results showed that the energy storage can achieve an attractive internal rate of return for some regions [29] investigated the optimal procurement and scheduling of battery storage in distribution system with high photovoltaic (PV) penetration [30] assessed the economic viability of storage projects in the power grid under increasing wind penetration levels [31] quantiﬁed the economics of energy storage participating in arbitrage and regulation services within different markets [9] evaluated the economic viability of battery energy storage, and estimated the optimal storage scales for energy storage in China.

The energy storage on the terminal side is growth fast in medium and smaller scale systems [32]. In distribution, EES can be installed in various places from the substation down to the end customers [33], which is often treated as DES. The DES can bring a lot beneﬁts such as improving the reliability, enhancement of distributed generator and reducing equipment cost [34]. Batteries are probably the best option for DES [35]. The battery systems can offer a number of high-value opportunities in energy storage for the

grid [5,36] conducted the techno-economic analysis for residential battery storage systems and determined the optimal sizing [37] proposed a strategy for optimal integration of battery energy storage and illustrated that the DES can improve the hosting ability of the utility grid.

3. Methodology

3.1. Market description

The electric utility of China is monopolized by two grid companies, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and the China Southern Grid Corporation (CSGC) [38]. These two giants control the process of transmission and distribution (T&D), distribution and retail. Although the power plants have been separated from the grid company since the last round reform, the feed-in tariff is still regulated by power grid and local regulators [39,40]. Due to the monopoly in T&D process, the amount of feed-in electricity is also dispatched by the grid companies. During operation, the power grid enterprises play the role of guaranteeing the power supply. In each province, there are local grid companies which are afﬁliates of SGCC and CSGC. The two power grid companies implement vertical management of provincial power grid companies, and provincial power grid companies undertake the actual operation of network planning, construction, maintenance and power reliability guarantee.

The electrical grids represent both a natural monopoly and an essential facility. The power grids have to be regulated to avoid the abuse of market dominant position [41]. In China, the provincial government remains directly involved in investment and planning decisions, the feed-in tariff and retail price are different in each province [42]. The current price mechanism is that “retail price ¼ feed-in tariff þ T&D price þ T&D loss þ government fund”

[43]. Feed-in tariff is the price purchased by power grids when access to the main grid. T&D price is the transmission and distribution cost included in the sales price. It mainly includes the depreciation of T&D facility and operating costs. The price variance between purchase and retail of each province often represents the cost in T&D process.

In the actual implementation, the pricing of electricity often adopts a ﬁxed price mechanism. For example, the retail price for the general industrial and commercial department is usually identical

[43]. Although there the peak-valley prices policy is implemented, the electricity price is also conducted a ﬁx price mode, which without taking into account the real-time cost of electricity. For such monopolistic state-owned enterprises as the power grid, economic interests are not their primary purpose. Grid companies often sacriﬁce economic beneﬁts to ensure the reliability of power supply. At the peak of electricity demand, electricity prices are lower than the marginal cost of electricity supply. In the actual operation process, due to the lack of ﬂexible price mechanism, and the mandatory task of the power grid for power supply, the power grid infrastructure often maintains a large degree of redundancy, which results in an inefﬁcient of grid investment.

3.2. The model design

Taking into accounts the special condition of China, the method to analyze the application value of energy storage in the previous studies may be hard to be adopted. On the one hand, the retail price of electricity is regulated and couldn't reﬂect the actual marginal cost of electricity supply. On the other hand, under the ﬁx price mechanism, it's difﬁcult to evaluate the consumer's reservation price of the electricity.

To deal with these problems, we propose an analytical framework to evaluate the beneﬁt of energy storage in the power grid which is installed on the terminal side, which can be regarded as a kind of demand side management tool. Fig. 1 provided the illustration. The EES includes battery system and inverter. By allocating the energy storage, the terminal load of the demand side can be smoothed and the infrastructure investment of the power grid can be reduced [34].

The beneﬁts of the electricity energy storage (EES) for power grid are mainly in two aspects. First, EES can shift the load and reduce the peak load, so that the power grid can reduce the investment for the facility. The savings in investment costs can be seen as a beneﬁt. The second is the reduction of feed-in cost. The marginal feed-in tariffs of the grid at different time points are different. In the peak period, the marginal feed-in electricity is supplied by high cost generators such as gas generation and pumped storage. The load shift from peak to valley will decrease the share of high feed-in tariff supply. The optimization objective function is presented in Eq. (1), which aims to maximize the proﬁt of the power grid for a certain customer load mode when applying the EES. The symbol R gc y represents the reduction of grid reinforcement costs, R ls is the revenue of load shift and C ESS y is the investment cost of the DES facility. Of course, there are some other beneﬁt by allocating the EES such as the value of ancillary and max To evaluate the reduction of grid reinforcement costs, it's required to know the unit construction cost the power grid. However, since the China's power grids never published the speciﬁc investment data, we need to push backwards through the actual operating costs of the grid. As illustrated in Eq. (2), we decompose the operation cost of the power grid into two parts: the T&D loss cost and the grid capacity cost. Wherein, C Grid represents the annual T&D and feed-in cost; E is annual power purchase, h loss represents the line loss rate, P B represents the average feed-in tariff, Lmax  represents the maximum load of the power grid, and C lg represents the annual unit load capacity cost. It should be noted that the T&D costs of the power grid are simpliﬁed as a linear function of the power grid capacity. This implicitly assumes that the grid is constant returns to scale. While this may introduce some bias, making such simplifying assumptions is useful in analyzing key issues where data sources are limited.

In the condition of price regulation, the proﬁtability of China's power grid enterprises is often very low. The rate of return on the grid may be hard to cover the economic rent (ie, opportunity cost) of the grid assets. Therefore, according to the research of [9], we assume that the grid has zero economic proﬁt, which means the sales revenue equal to the grid cost (Eq. (3)). In the equation, R Grid is the annual electricity retail revenue of the grid, P S is the average retail price. In fact, R Grid equivalents to the difference between the feed-in and retail process.

By adopting EES, the peak load can be reduced. According to the unit cost of grid capacity, we can calculate the revenue from the reduction of grid reinforcement costs R gc y , which can be expressed as Eq. (5). In the equation, the return of the grid is a linear function of the maximum load variation of the grid.

The variation of peak load DL max will be affected by the installed capacity of the DES and the speciﬁc operating mode. When the energy storage facility is put into operation, it will affect the grid load. The variation of grid load can be expressed by Eq. (6). l g is the spot load of the power grid, l c is the spot load of the demand side, and is the charge-discharge volume from the energy storage system to the grid.

In the absence of energy storage devices, the grid load l g will equal to the demand side load l c . After connecting the DES, the grid load will change due to the load transfer. According to the maximum load before and after the adoption of DES, the variation of the peak load can be calculated which is shown in Eq. (7). The symbol l g represents the annual maximum load of grid (Eq. (8)), and l c represent the annual maximum load of demand side (Eq. (9)).

The stored quantity of electricity is given by Eq. (10). The symbol xðtÞ represents the net output electricity of DES in period t. When xðtÞ ! 0, the DES is in the process of discharge, the energy conversion efﬁciency of the battery h ES and the efﬁciency of the inverter h inver need to be taken into consideration. If xðtÞ < 0, the DES is in the process of charge, it may need to consider the efﬁciency of the inverter. The stored quantity in each hour SðtÞ should be greater than 0 and less than the max storage capacity S C (Eq. (11)). The charge and discharge volume should satisfy the maximum power constraint of the energy storage system (Eq. (12)). The upper limit of power Pow H is proportional to the max capacity of the energy storage system (Eq. (13)), where the scaling factor x is used to denote the ratio between system capacity and maximum power.

In China, the feed-in tariff is also regulated by the government. A ﬁx price mode is adopted for the generator. However, the feed-in tariff is different for different kind of power generator. The coal power and hydropower is often implemented a low feed-in tariff, and supply for most of the needs. But in the period of high demand load, the marginal generator is gas generator, which adopts a high feed-in tariff. The revenue of load shift is the price deviation between charge and discharge process, which can be calculated by Eq. (14). The symbol R ls represents the revenue of load shift, and P E is the marginal feed-in tariff. P E will change with the capacity of storage. As shown in Eq. (15), when the capacity of energy storage is small, all the marginal feed-in power which is substituted by energy storage is source from high-cost generator such as natural gas power generation. With the extending of energy storage capacity, the ratio of high feed-in tariff electricity in the marginal electricity support will decrease. The symbol P H represents the high feed-in tariff, and the symbol P L is the low feed-in tariff. The g H is the volume of high feed-in tariff power generator.

electricity. The capacity of the energy storage is determined by the peak load deviation and the price deviation.

Some previous studies have used dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to solve this kind of problem [45] [46]. To solve our model, we combine the enumeration method and the DP algorithm. First, we enumerate all the storage capacity, and then adopt the DP algorithm to determine the optimal operating mode under each storage capacity. According to the revenue and cost under different storage capacity, we can get the optimal storage scale.

When conducting the DP algorithm, there was the need to decompose a large optimization problem into some sub problems. The solution of a sub problem depends on the state of the solution of previous states. Since electricity demand tends ﬂuctuate in days, we decompose the whole operational problem into sub problems which treat one day as a cycle. The time interval between sub questions is T ¼ ½T 1 ;T 2 ;/T n . Under a certain storage capacity, the annual cost of EES is also determined, and can be regarded as a constant when solving the optimization problem. In the initial state, that is, for the ﬁrst sub problem, the optimal solution is given by Eq. (20). The storage volume at the end of the ﬁrst sub problem should be used as the initial value of the next sub problem.
 
In general, EES on the terminal side includes two main sections: power conversion system (PCS) and energy storage section [44]. In the model of [9], the investment cost of EES can be calculated by the cost of storage battery and inverter. According to Eq. (16), the investment of storage system C ESS is a function of storage capacity, unit cost of storage battery C S unit and unit cost of inverter C inv unit . Since we calculate the annualized investment income in Eq. (1), investment cost should also be apportioned to the annual investment cost according to the lifetime of the EES and the discount rate. Eq. (17) and Eq. (18) give the speciﬁc calculation method.

Eq. (21) provides the optimal function of the sub problem. The net output volume xðtÞ will inﬂuence the peak load and should be treated as the state variable.

The peak load l g is a function of the state which will change with the progress of the sub problem. As can be observed in the previous equations, the maximum load on the grid depends on the initial load and the discharge volume of the energy storage system. When solving for the k-th sub-problem, we can get the maximum load change of the power grid based on the charge-discharge volume from the initial time to the state k (Eq. (22)).

The above equations could be organized as the form of Eq. (19). The decision variables in the optimal problem include the installed capacity of energy storage S C and the discharge volume of EES at 8760 time points xðtÞ.

For the non-initial state solution, the new state contains the state of the previous sub problem and the solution of the current sub problem. Speciﬁcally, as presented in Eq. (23), the decision variables in the interval ½T nÀ1 ; T n  need to satisfy the condition of Eq. (24).

3.3. Data summary

(19)

The system operating conditions can be described in Fig. 2. The reduction of peak load can reduce the cost of power grid. The price deviation between charge and discharge can bring the revenue from arbitrage. When the load is low, the marginal feed-in tariff PE  is low, and when the load is increase, the marginal feed-in tariff will increase until all the marginal supply are from the high cost

To verify the value of the model, we use the data of a provincial grid, which includes the spot load in the whole year, and the marginal power plant in each time point. . In 2015, Anhui's electricity consumption was 179.5 TWh, which exceeded the electricity consumption of the Netherlands, Poland, roughly 60% of UK's and one-third of Germany's electricity consumption. Fig. 3 illustrates the probability density distribution and cumulative density distribution of Anhui power gird's annual spot load in 2015. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the load distribution in Anhui Province is close to the normal distribution, and the right side also shows the characteristics of long tail distribution. The capacity of the power grid needs to satisfy the peak load. For most of the period, the grid is operating in an unsaturated state. The case we choose had an annual maximum load of 28.68 GW, and annual minimum load of

8.59 GW. The maximum load is 3.34 times than the minimum load. The average load was 16.37 GW which was only 57.1% of the maximum load. In more than 90% of the time, the grid load is below

19.3 GW. This implies that the maximum load of the power grid is actually only satisfy the peak load of a few hours.

The load characteristics of the power grid bring a lot of potential for the application of energy storage. The occurrence of extreme load is very short means the marginal supply beneﬁt to the maximum load is small. However, the marginal cost to supply the peak load will not decrease. In fact, all the investment cost of the power grid will be spread into the retail price and ﬁnally transfer to the consumers. If the energy storage system is used to cut the valley and ﬁll the peak to help improve the utilization of power grid equipment, the investment scale of the power grid could be curtailed effectively.

The main parameters of the model are summarized in Table 1. The investment cost and system parameters of DES source from Ref. [43], the electricity consumption is from Anhui statistical yearbook 2016; the annual average feed-in tariff and annual average retail price source from Ref. [47]; the peak load, spot load, high feed-in tariff and low feed-in tariff are provide by the Anhui provincial electric power company.

4. Result and discussion

4.1. The optimal energy storage size Fig. 4 illustrates the revenue and cost variance with the energy storage capacity. Since the unit cost of the distributed energy storage is constant, the total energy storage cost C ESS increases linearly with the increase in the capacity of DES. The revenue of power will grow with the capacity of DES. However, the marginal revenue of total revenue will decrease due to the marginal revenue of grid reinforcement reduction R gc and load shift R ls will decrease. When the installed capacity of energy storage is small, adding one unit of energy storage can effectively reduce the peak load of the power grid and reduce the construction cost of the power grid. However, with the increase of the capacity of energy storage, the effect on peak load reduction will gradually decrease. The net revenue equal to the total revenue minus the energy storage cost, which exist an optimal revenue point. For our research case, the optimal storage capacity is 5 GWh where the net revenue can achieve a max level. This result can help us quantitatively analyze the optimal value of energy storage applications.

Fig. 5 can help us better understand the reason why the marginal revenue of grid reinforcement is decrease. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the load distribution of electric power is often unbalanced and the peak load occupies a shorter time. When the maximum load of the grid is decreasing from L 1 to L2 , the required energy storage capacity is equivalent to the area of ABC in the diagram. When the load is reducing from L 2 to L3 , the required energy storage capacity is equal to the area of BCDE in the diagram, which is higher than the area of ABD intuitively. Therefore, with the drop of high load, the requisite capacity to further reduce the maximum load of the same amplitude is increased.

In addition to the revenue of power grid reinforcement, the revenue from load shift will also decrease with the increase of the DES capacity, which is mainly due to the limited quantity of high-priced electricity. When the capacity of energy storage is small, most of the energy storage can be used to substitute the high-price electricity. However, as the capacity of energy storage increases, most of the high-priced electricity will has been substituted, and it will be more difﬁcult to obtain peak shift beneﬁts. Fig. 6 shows the load curves of one week in different seasons to show how the energy storage system will inﬂuence the power grid. The customer load represent the load demand of the customer side, and the grid load represent the load of grid support which equal to the customer load plus the storage load. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the adoption of the energy storage system can effectively reduce the peak load and achieve a load shifting. The load of grid will be smoother compare with the actual customer load.

Energy storage on the terminal side can bring great beneﬁts to the power grid, but because it often needs to be deployed on the demand side, the grid needs to transfer part of the revenue to the customers. Therefore, how to design an appropriate beneﬁt allocation mechanism is essential to realize the value of EES. In the free electricity market, the price of electricity ﬂuctuates in a relatively large range, so the proﬁt of EES can be realized through arbitrage. Simultaneously, the power grid can also beneﬁt from the arbitrage process [48]. However, for a regulated electricity market like China, demand-side electricity prices are strictly regulated because power grid enterprises monopolize the transmission, distribution, and sales of electricity. At present, many regions implement peak-valley pricing, that is, electricity prices are divided into three periods, which are peak, valley and ﬂat. However, the research of [43] pointed out that peak-valley electricity prices and peak-valley time periods are often ﬁxed. They argued that the arbitrage of energy storage in China's electricity market may make the deployed of EES unreasonable under some conditions. In other words, when the price is ﬁxed, if the net present value of the energy storage investment is negative, there will be no installed energy storage capacity. And if the net present value is positive, it may lead to excessive capacity of energy storage and make the load distribution more unbalanced.

4.2. Sensitivity analysis

The parameters such as discount rate, battery cost, battery system life, peak electricity price, grid cost, which are considered as exogenous variables in the model, may affect energy storage investment. The values of these exogenous variables may change constantly. To analyze the inﬂuence of exogenous variables, sensitivity analysis is conducted in this section.

Fig. 7 describes the effect of the variance of different variables. The ﬁrst ﬁgure in Fig. 7 is about the inﬂuence of discount rate on the optimal energy storage capacity and the optimal return. As the discount rate decreases, the optimal investment scale will increase and the optimal return will increase. This is mainly due to the fact that the present value of future income will increase after the discount rate decreases, which brings higher applied value to energy storage. Since the investment expenditure is paid at the launch period, the marginal cost of energy storage does not vary, so the optimal energy storage capacity and income increase at the equilibrium point.

The cost of the battery also will inﬂuence the optimal scale of energy storage. The lower the cost is, the higher the optimal energy storage capacity will be. In addition, the cost of batteries is probably one of the most variable factors. According to the estimation of [49], the annual cost of lithium batteries fell by an annual average of 8% during 2007e2014 and the trend is still likely to pursue. The cost of battery is the major part of EES investment. The application value of energy storage will increase with the decline of battery cost in the future.

In practice, a more ﬂexible approach can be taken to reduce the cost of the energy storage system. As indicated by Ref. [50], the current secondary energy storage devices which are reused based on decommissioned vehicle batteries are also one way to improve

Fig. 7. The optimal storage capacity and proﬁt under different condition.

utilization efﬁciency. China is currently the largest market for electric vehicles in the world, and sales of electric vehicles are still growing rapidly [51]. Therefore, there will be considerable retired vehicle batteries in the future, which may be suitable for the EES system. Of course, the energy conversion efﬁciency of the retired batteries will be low, so the exact value of the application remains to be further studied.

System lifetime will also affect the application value of energy storage. A longer service life of energy storage facility would enhance the corresponding optimal energy storage scale and income. However, because of the limitations technology, it is often more difﬁcult to extend battery life than to reduce costs. To lithium batteries, for example, the main impact on the lifetime is the stability of the electrode, which requires a breakthrough in material technology. This requires the government to increase investment in basic research of battery materials.

The increase of high feed-in tariff will enhance the optimal capacity of EES and the proﬁt. The main reason for this phenomenon is that the increase of high feed-in tariff will enhance the revenue from load shift. China's current high feed-in tariff generators are mainly sourcing from natural gas generation and pumped storage, which is used to respond to peak load of. China's natural resource endowment is characterized by a lack of natural gas, which led to a high natural gas prices. Although the price of natural gas is also regulated by the government, the consequence of this is the lack of supply of natural gas. At present, the annual operation hours of China's natural gas power generation is 2340 h, which are equivalent to running with only 26.7% of the load. Therefore, if the demand for natural gas goes up in the future, the high feed-in tariff still has the possibility to rise. Moreover, LNG accounts for a large proportion of the natural gas supply. The price of LNG tends to be more volatile. For example, for SeptembereDecember 2017, LNG prices in the Chinese market have risen by 156% due to a shortage of LNG supplies. Considering the inﬂuence of natural gas price increase, the application value of energy storage in the future will be further enhanced.

The grid reinforcement cost will also affect the optimal result. Grid reinforcement cost analysis can be adopted to evaluate the new electricity infrastructure. On the one hand, as the price of land, labor and material rise, grid reinforcement costs will rise. Also, the expansion of the power grid may be based on the existing grid and the corresponding cost may be lower than the original construction cost. Here, we use the total asset turnover rate of SGCC as the indicator to evaluate the variation trend of grid reinforcement cost. The SGCC accounts for more than 80% of China's electricity market and can be representative of China's power grid. The total asset turnover rate equals operating income divided by total assets. The operating income of grid comes from sales revenue, which is linearly related to the electric sales volume. The total asset of the grid is the value of grid infrastructure. In 2008, the aggregate asset turnover rate of SGCC was 0.6814, while its total asset turnover rate in 2016 was 0.6434. The slowing down of asset turnover means that when the same unit of electricity is supplied, the cost of the grid is on the rise in recent years. If the trend will continue in the future, the value of energy storage will increase.

5. Conclusion and policy implication

Energy storage has the application value in the ﬁeld of load shift and peak load reduction. At present, the frequent business mechanism of energy storage is price arbitrage. In a free market, the price arbitrage of electricity can bring beneﬁts to both the grid and the arbitrageurs. The arbitrageurs can acquire revenue from arbitrage, and the grid can smooth the load demand. However, for a regulated market such as China, the electricity price is always regulated by government and does not reﬂect the true cost of electricity supply. However, China is the world's largest electricity market, accounting for 1/4 of the world's electricity consumption. Therefore, it is of profound signiﬁcance for government and power grid enterprises to study the application value of energy storage in regulated electricity markets. Based on the previous literature, and from the perspective of power grid enterprises, this paper sets up a framework for analyzing the application value of energy storage in a regulated market. In this model, the inﬂuence of the application of energy storage on the grid reinforcement cost and load shift revenue is examined. A dynamic programming method is adopted to determine the operation mode, which divides the optimal problem into some sub problems.

The results demonstrate that the energy storage can bring net revenue for the power grid. However, with the expansion of EES scale, the marginal revenue of grid reinforcement and load shift will gradually decrease, which implies that the application of EES is diminishing marginal returns. For a speciﬁed load mode and electricity demand, there is an optimal EES scale. Our model also calculates the optimal operation mode for the EES system. It is found that the EES can effectively reduce the load ﬂuctuation of the power grid. To further analyze the impact of exogenous variables, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine how the discount rate, battery costs, battery life, peak electricity prices and grid reinforcement costs will inﬂuence the optimal energy storage installed capacity. The results of this paper can provide valuable information and suggestions for power grid enterprises and policy maker:

First, since EES is often deployed on the demand side, a reasonable proﬁt distribution mechanism needs to be designed between the power grid and the customers. The subsidy mechanism can be designed referring to the distributed photovoltaic policy of China, which provide cross-subsidize according to the capacity of power generation. The exact amount of subsidy should be determined according to the revenue of the power grid. Under this subsidy model, the customer and grid companies can share the beneﬁt of energy storage, which lead to Pareto improvements. Meanwhile, due to the existence of the optimal storage capacity, a quota system can be adopted to ensure the optimal size of EES.

Second, the optimal energy storage scale is inﬂuenced by the battery cost and service lifetime. Battery cost is likely to remain declining, so the potential for future energy storage may be further expanded. For the government, it is necessary to increase R&D subsidies to speed up the progress of battery technology. In addition, an appropriate policy should be designed to promote the secondary utilization of the batteries of retired vehicles battery to reduce the cost of energy storage system.

Third, increasing the high feed-in tariff will increase the value of energy storage. At present, the peak demand of China's power is major relying on natural gas generation. However, as the price of natural gas is also regulated by the government and kept purposely low, the price of China's natural gas feed-in tariffs has been depressed. The efﬁciency of the electricity market can be improved by reducing the demand of peak natural gas power generation. Therefore, the government should reduce the regulation of natural gas price and stimulates the application of energy storage facility."
6,Challenges and strategies for electricity market transition in China,"China is currently pursuing electricity reforms that will create wholesale markets for electricity. Electricity markets hold considerable promise for facilitating China's transition to clean energy systems, but face obstacles. The most significant obstacle to market reforms is their potential financial impact on coal generation, which currently accounts for most of China's generating capacity. In this paper, we examine the impact of market reforms on coal generation in China, using Guangdong Province as a case study. We find that, in the near term, market prices are likely to lead to significant decreases in net revenues for coal generators relative to the current benchmark tariff, with 40%–60% of coal generation capacity unable to cover the cost of remaining in commercial operation. We estimate that existing coal generators in Guangdong had 94 billion yuan (US$14 billion) in outstanding debt in 2016, creating large risks for banks and raising questions about the potential impacts of electricity market reforms on China's financial industry. The impact of market reforms on coal generators creates two problems—transition and resource adequacy. The development of mechanisms for long-term resource adequacy provides a common solution to both of these problems.","1. Introduction

Electricity markets hold considerable promise for facilitating China's transition to clean energy systems. China is currently pursuing electricity reforms, outlined in the State Council's 2015 “Document 9” and subsequent regulatory documents, that would create wholesale markets for electricity. However, transition obstacles have the potential to frustrate market reforms. The most significant potential obstacle is the financial impact of market reform on coal generation, which currently accounts for most of China's electricity generating capacity.

This paper assesses the financial impacts of electricity market transition on coal generators in Guangdong Province, based on an analysis of expected market revenues and costs. The paper is organized into four sections. Section 2 (Background) provides an overview of how the risks associated with generation costs were historically allocated and how they are likely to be reallocated in a competitive electricity market. Section 3 (Methods and Data) summarizes the methods used in this analysis. Section 4 (Results) presents results. Drawing on the results, section 5 (Conclusions and Policy Implications) examines how policymakers in China can navigate the transition to electricity markets. 2. Background

The development of electricity markets will lead to significant changes in the allocation of risk across electricity generators, buyers, and customers in China. Focusing on coal-fired generation, this section provides an overview of historical approaches to setting generation tariffs in China and how electricity markets will reallocate that risk. Generation tariffs have substantially shaped the structure of China's thermal generation mix.

2.1. Generation tariffs in China, 1985–2018

In 1985, facing power shortages, China's central government opened generation investment and ownership to new, non-utility actors: provincial government-owned companies, foreign companies, and domestic private companies. The emergence of non-utility generators required a means to compensate them, which was achieved through wholesale generation tariffs. The first of these tariffs (“cost plus tariff” in Table 1) was developed in 1985. Restructuring in 2002 increased the importance of wholesale generation tariffs, as the national State Power Corporation was split into separate generation and grid companies.

In the 1990s and 2000s, successive rounds of revisions to wholesale generation tariffs sought to enable full-cost recovery for generators while providing stronger incentives for cost reductions. Table 1 provides a summary of generation pricing in China since 1985, focusing on coal generation tariffs. 1

Historically, generation tariffs in China faced two main interrelated challenges: (1) managing fuel—mostly coal—price volatility, given the political sensitivity around raising retail electricity prices; and (2) balancing incentives for generator availability and investment cost recovery.

China's generation tariffs were set on an energy (yuan/kWh) basis, which meant that generator revenues and profits were tied to their operating hours. To ensure fair allocation of these hours, in the early 2000s government agencies developed an annual planning process to set generator operating hours, based on a principle of “equal allocation for similar technologies” (State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), 2004). If generation capacity was scarce, average operating hours would increase and generators would earn above-average net revenues. If generation capacity was in excess, average operating hours would decrease and generators would earn below-average net revenues.

Political difficulties in raising retail electricity prices meant that pricing bureaus adjusted the benchmark tariff on an infrequent basis and tariff changes were only loosely tied to changes in coal prices. When coal prices were rising and pricing bureaus did not promptly adjust tariffs, generators absorbed the fuel cost increase, reducing their net revenues. When coal prices were falling and pricing bureaus did not promptly adjust tariffs, generators retained the increase in net revenues.

The electricity reform process initiated through Document 9 in 2015 seeks to replace both the wholesale generation tariff and the mechanism for passing through fuel cost changes with market-determined pricing (State Council of the People's Republic of China, 2015). To facilitate this transition, the central government began to allow larger industrial customers and competitive retail providers to contract directly with coal generators for energy. From 2015 to 2018, government agencies gradually reduced the number of planned hours allocated to coal generators, forcing them to rely on market transactions for an increasing share of their energy sales. At the same time, government agencies began to allow larger industrial customers to procure their energy either directly from generators or through a competitive provider.

This “medium- and long-term market” (中长期市场) includes two primary trading options: (1) one-year bilateral contracts for energy (MWh) signed between generators and load serving entities (LSEs); (2) monthly centralized auctions for energy (MWh) organized by a power exchange (South China Energy Regulatory Office (SCERO) of National Energy Administration, 2018a). The monthly auctions are cleared using a uniform market clearing price. In late 2018, Guangdong became the

first province to announce detailed rules for an electricity spot market, which will include day-ahead and real-time markets (South China Energy Regulatory Office (SCERO) of National Energy Administration, 2018b).

2.2. Generation cost recovery in a market environment

The transition toward market pricing will have a significant impact on generation cost recovery and the allocation of risks between sellers (mostly generators) and buyers (mostly large customers and retail providers).

In a competitive market environment, generators recover their investment and other fixed costs through net revenues: revenues minus short-run operating costs (Stoft, 2002) (Rothwell and Gomez, 2003). In long-term bilateral contracts, these net revenues are the result of negotiations between buyers and sellers. For instance, if a buyer and seller negotiate a contract for 350 yuan/MWh ($51/MWh) and the seller has an average short-run operating cost of 300 yuan/MWh, the seller will earn net revenues of 50 yuan for each MWh sold to the buyer. Contract prices are driven by supply and demand. In markets that are oversupplied, buyers will be able to drive down contract prices to levels close to the minimum level that generators need to remain in commercial operation (“going forward costs”). In markets where supply is tight, sellers will be able to drive up contract prices to levels close to or even exceeding the cost of new entry for a new generating unit.

In organized markets with uniform market clearing prices (monthly and spot markets in China), generators’ net revenues are the difference between the market clearing price and their short-run operating cost. If markets are competitive, generators will bid their expected short-run marginal cost in these shorter-term, uniform clearing price markets, to avoid the potential downside of not being dispatched.

In markets with well-developed forward markets (e.g., bilateral contracting, monthly auctions) and spot markets, prices will tend to converge toward spot market pricing, as market participants can arbitrage between forward and spot markets over time. 2 If spot market prices are low, buyers will tend to be reluctant to sign long-term contracts. If spot market prices are high, sellers will tend to be reluctant to sign long-term contracts (Pfeifenberger and Newell, 2011). As in all markets, the equilibrium between these competing forces is shaped by the balance between greed and fear. In electricity markets, this equilibrium is often shaped by regulations around resource adequacy that aim to ensure adequate generation resources (Cramton and Stoft, 2006; Cramton et al., 2013; Joskow, 2007).

Market pricing will tend to reduce fuel price risk for generators, as they can pass through fuel price changes to LSEs through a combination of fuel price indices in bilateral contracts and spot market pricing. However, a central tenet of wholesale electricity markets is that generators take on some, and in some cases a significant amount of, fixed cost recovery risk.

In China, a key challenge for the transition to electricity markets is that the majority of the country's electricity generation capacity consists of large, efficient baseload coal units that were built within the last decade-and-a-half. When supply exceeds demand, as it currently does in some parts of the country, average spot market prices will tend to fall to the short-run operating cost of a relatively efficient mid-merit coal unit, which may make it difficult for coal generators to recover their fixed costs. As a result, negotiations around stranded costs may become critical to the electricity reform process.

2.3. Stranded costs and electricity market transition: international experience

Questions around stranded costs were a central theme in the transition to competitive electricity markets in most countries. However, philosophies on allowing stranded cost recovery and mechanisms for recovering stranded costs differed significantly both among and within countries, due to differences in generation characteristics and regulatory cultures.

“Stranded cost” is3 typically defined as the difference between the regulated book value and market value of an individual asset or multiple assets, if the value of these assets is lower—and thus some approved costs and investment returns are unrecoverable—in a competitive market than under regulation (Maloney et al., 1997; Woo et al., 2003; Office and U.S, 1998; Kahn, 1998; Joskow, 2000). The existence of stranded costs presupposes regulated costs and returns, though performance-based cost mechanisms have often been considered a form of “regulated costs” (Woo et al., 2003).

This simple definition belies the complexity of defining, measuring, and efficiently and equitably recovering stranded costs. Successful navigation of these issues is critical to market transition. The collapse of California's electricity market in 2001 was due, in part, to the failure of regulators to understand and anticipate the tradeoffs and risks in different approaches to stranded cost recovery (Woo et al., 2003).

From a regulatory perspective, stranded cost recovery requires two determinations: (1) to what extent should companies be allowed to recover stranded costs; and (2) if companies are allowed to recover stranded costs, how should these costs be recovered (Hempling et al., 1994)?

In the United States, a polemical literature developed around the first question. Proponents of allowing utilities to recover stranded costs argued that utility investments and contracts were undertaken in good faith, were deemed prudent and approved by regulators, and were part of utilities’ obligation to serve all customers (Baumol and Sidak, 1995). Opponents argued that utilities should have made investments and negotiated contracts that were consistent with market outcomes, and, thus, that allowing them to recover stranded costs would be societally inefficient (Michaels, 1995). A third view argued that stranded cost recovery was inefficient, but allowing at least some recovery of stranded costs might be necessary to build broad support for reforms (Black, 1994), (Brennan and Boyd, 1997).

Table 2 provides a more general summary of arguments for and against allowing stranded cost recovery.

In practice, regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and some other parts of Europe allowed incumbent providers to recover most or all of their above-market costs as part of the transition to electricity markets. In the United States, these costs were primarily associated with above-market contracts with independent power producers that were mandated by the federal government's Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) and, to a lesser extent, with utilityowned high cost nuclear facilities. In the United Kingdom, stranded costs were primarily associated with publicly owned nuclear facilities. In the United States, the decision to allow stranded cost recovery was a regulatory decision rather than a legal one. Even at the federal level, there was never a legal basis for compensating incumbent providers for stranded costs.

The primary challenge to measuring stranded costs is that electricity market prices, and some generation costs (e.g., nuclear decommissioning costs), are not known in advance. Baxter and Hirst (1995) describe three methodological dimensions along which stranded costs are typically assessed: (1) administrative versus market, or whether the value of incumbents’ assets is determined by public agencies or market participants; (2) ex ante versus ex post, or whether stranded costs are assessed before or after market prices are known; and (3) bottom-up versus top-down, or whether stranded costs are determined on the basis of a detailed calculation of asset-specific costs or a high-level portfoliowide metric. In practice, regulators in the United States used a combination of divestment (market valuation), ex ante valuation and ex post adjustment, and top-down settlement with bottom-up verification and reconciliation.

The design of mechanisms for stranded cost recovery can have a significant impact on market outcomes. To guide the design of such mechanisms, Tye and Graves (1997) described several criteria: “reliable cost recovery, competitive neutrality, allocative efficiency, fairness of incidence on customers, transparency and predictability, administrative simplicity, objectivity, automatic termination, and incentives to mitigate.” In principle, U.S. regulators accepted that stranded cost recovery mechanisms should seek to minimize distortions on market prices and transactions, should be non-bypassable, and should limit cost recovery to a short, fixed period (Fox-Penner, 1997).

In practice, there was a diversity of designs for stranded cost recovery mechanisms, ranging from California's “headroom charge” (difference between market prices and frozen retail rate), to volumetric surcharges on loads, to fixed surcharges on loads via transmission or customer charges (Woo et al., 2003). Woo et al. (Woo et al., 2003) argue that fixed charges based on historical consumption provide the best balance among collection certainty, efficiency, and equity.

Issues around stranded costs in China's transition to electricity markets differ from that in the United States and Europe in three respects: (1) generation assets have already been transferred to separate generating companies; (2) the vast majority of these generation assets are owned by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privatization of these assets is unlikely; and (3) grid companies, which have historically been the only load serving entities in China, did not have long-term contractual liabilities with generators.

These differences suggest that, to a larger extent than in the United States and Europe, a threshold question for Chinese regulators will be whether the financial impact of market reforms on state-owned generating companies should be cushioned by allowing them to recover some or all of the investment costs that are stranded in the transition to markets. If the answer is “yes,” a key question for Chinese regulators is mechanism design and “who pays”: how the costs are spread across state-owned banks, other SOEs, and different classes of electricity consumers.

As in the United States (Hammond and Rossi, 2016) and Europe (Caldecott and McDaniels, 2014), the transition to a low-carbon electricity sector will also have implications for the potential for stranded assets—in particular coal-fired generating assets—in China's electricity sector. The transition to electricity markets complicates stranded cost considerations related to environmental policy, because, in principle, generators should be shouldering more investment risk.

3. Methods

This section focuses on analytics and definitions. The supplementary materials contain a detailed description of data inputs and sources.

The database of coal plants in Guangdong developed for this project includes 173 units with 63,890 MW of installed capacity. To calculate net revenues by generator, we categorize these 173 units into 6 bins according to their installed capacity and initial year of commercial operation. We assign average gross revenues and net revenues to each generator type based on the results of a market dispatch model described by Lin et al. (2018), where net revenues for generator type i (NR ) are equal to gross revenues (GRi ) minus short-run operating costs (OCi i ).

Short-run operating costs include fuel and variable operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.

We use three energy market price scenarios: (1) Low Market Price, which has low coal prices (800 yuan/tce) and a high hydro year (3550 fully loaded operating hours for hydropower); (2) High Market Price, which has high coal prices (1000 yuan/tce) and a low hydro year (2096 operating hours, based on 2015 actual); and (3) Benchmark, based on the 2016 benchmark tariff (0.4505 yuan/kWh) and 2016 operating hours (3932 h/yr).

Our projected average energy market prices in the Low Market Price and High Market Price scenarios are 302 yuan/MWh (US$44/MWh) and 371 yuan/MWh (US$54/MWh), respectively. These prices correspond to the marginal cost of a medium-efficiency (330–340 kgce/ MWh) coal unit. Table 3 shows projected gross and net revenues by generator type and price scenario, based on these market prices and the benchmark tariff. All values and inputs are in nominal terms.

Market revenues in Table 3 do not include revenues from participation in ancillary services or capacity markets or from scarcity pricing. Averaged across the coal generation fleet, ancillary services revenues would be small as a share of total revenues. We discuss capacity market revenues as a sensitivity in the results.

Generator annual fixed costs consist of labor, fixed maintenance, insurance, annual debt service, and tax costs. Generators are generally required to pay labor, insurance, fixed maintenance, and taxes to remain in commercial operation. We refer to these costs as “going forward fixed costs.”

To assign labor, insurance, and fixed maintenance costs (“fixed O& M costs”) to generators, we classifygenerators into six categories according to their installed capacity. For data availability reasons, these six categories are different than the six categories for assigning gross and net revenues. Fixed O&M costs for generator type j (FO j ) are the sum of labor (LAj ), insurance (IN j ), and fixed maintenance costs (FM j ).

Non-income taxes include operating, other, and value added taxes. “Other” is a residual category that includes urban construction, property, land use, and education taxes. Operating and other taxes are assessed on gross revenues. Value added tax is assessed on labor and capital value added.

Going forward fixed costs (GF ij ) i are the sum of fixed O&M costs (FO j ), operating and other taxes (OT ), and value added taxes (VT ij ).

Operating profit (OP ij ) is the amount remaining after generators have paid annual fixed O&M and taxes, or net revenues minus going forward fixed costs.

To assign capital costs to generators, we classify generators into five categories according to technology (ultra-supercritical, supercritical, subcritical), installed capacity, and initial year of commercial operation. Again, this classification (generator type k) is different than that used for revenues or fixed O&M costs. We match depreciation periods, debt share, debt interest, and loan repayment periods to generators based on their initial year of commercial operation.

Income tax (ITijk ) is assessed at the income tax rate (t) on operating profits minus annual depreciation (AD k ) and debt interest payments (DIk ).

For simplicity, we assume straight-line depreciation with matching depreciating and loan periods.

Generator net income (NI ijk )ijk is defined as net revenues (NRi ) minus fixed O&M costs (FO j ), operating and other taxes (OT i ), value added taxes (VT ), annual debt principal payments (DP k ), debt interest payments (DIk ij ), and income tax (IT ).

for 35% of the province's total installed coal capacity. The next two largest owners, China Energy Investment and Huaneng Power International, two of the central government-owned companies, hold 10% and 8% of Guangdong's total installed coal capacity.

On average, Guangdong's coal generation fleet is large, efficient, and new. Coal-fired units accounted for 61% of Guangdong's withinprovince installed generation capacity and 58% of its within-province electricity generation in 2016. Large (≥600 MW) units make up just over 60% of Guangdong's coal generation fleet (Fig. 1a) and three quarters of these large units use ultra-supercritical or supercritical technologies. Mid-size (300–350 MW) units account for most of the remainder (Fig. 1a).

About half of Guangdong's small-to mid-size coal generation capacity (≤350 MW) consists of combined heat and power (CHP) units. Many smaller (< 200 MW) units are on-site CHP. Nearly 70% of Guangdong's coal generation capacity was built after 2005 (Fig. 1b).

Guangdong's coal generation fleet is owned by 30 companies, with 92% of total capacity owned by 17 state-owned companies and most of this state-owned capacity majority-owned by local companies. Twelve of the 30 companies are privately owned, accounting for 8% of total capacity. The remaining units are owned by one international company. Fig. 2 shows the 12 largest companies in terms of installed capacity, representing 90% of installed coal capacity.

As Fig. 2 shows, coal generation ownership in Guangdong is relatively concentrated. The largest plant owner, Guangdong Yudean Group, owns 52 units with 22,375 MW of installed capacity, accounting

Guangdong's coal units have a significant amount of outstanding debt. We estimate that these units owe nearly 94 billion yuan (~US$14 billion, nominal yuan) in total debt principal and interest, based on 15year average loan repayment periods. Annual debt service payments for existing coal units peaked in 2015 and will be fully repaid in 2032, assuming no changes to repayment schedules (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 includes both historical and future debt payments for existing units; thus, for instance, an existing unit built in the year 2000 will begin making debt payments in 2000.)

Significant levels of outstanding debt are tied to the industry preference for debt financing for power projects in Guangdong—and in China more broadly. Estimates in this analysis are based on a capital structure with 80% debt.

4.2. Scenario results

Because most of Guangdong's coal capacity consists of large and new units, the going forward fixed cost curve (see Methods section for definitions) for the province's coal units is relatively flat. For most of the curve, going forward fixed costs are less than 200 yuan/kW-yr. The curve kinks when cumulative capacity reaches small on-site CHP plants and rises to a high of around 550 yuan/kW-yr (Fig. 4). Differences in going forward fixed costs among units are driven by economies of scale.

In the Benchmark scenario, all but two small on-site CHP plants have positive operating profits (Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b)—net revenues minus going forward fixed costs. Newer and larger plants have higher operating profits (Fig. 5c and d).

In the Low Market Price scenario, only about 20% of plants, representing around 40% of total installed capacity, have positive operating profits (Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b). These percentages are improved to 30% (of all plants) and 60% (of installed capacity) in the High Market Price scenario. In the Low Market Price scenario, only units larger than 1000 MW and built after 2010 have positive operating profits (Fig. 6c and d).

Operating profits are used to pay annual debt principal and interest, with the remainder used to pay income taxes and to provide return of and on equity capital. Fig. 7 shows total operating profit and annual debt interest and principal payments for each plant in the Benchmark and Low Market Price scenarios. Unit IDs are assigned to each unit in the order of their size (largest to smallest) and then year built (newest to oldest), with 1 representing the largest and newest unit. Units with zero debt principal and interest payments have already paid off their debt.

As shown in Fig. 7, in the Benchmark scenario, all but 10 units have high enough operating profit to pay annual debt4 interest and two-thirds Market Price scenario, no units can pay their full annual debt interest. In the High Market Price scenario, 13% of units can pay their full annual debt interest and 4% of units can pay full annual debt principal.

At a corporate level, 7 out of the 30 companies have positive operating profit and no companies can pay their full annual debt interest in the Low Market Price scenario. In the High Market Price scenario, 8 out of the 30 companies have positive operating profit and 2 (Huaneng and Datang) can pay their full annual debt interest. As shown in Fig. 8 in the Benchmark scenario, the top 10 companies by installed capacity have relatively high operating profits. However, their operating profits drop significantly under the Low Market Price and High Market Price scenarios, with one-third of these companies having negative operating profits. This means that their net market revenues are less than their going forward fixed costs. Net revenues—gross revenues minus short-run operating costs—for less efficient coal units would need to be much higher than in either market price scenario to significantly reduce the overall financial impact of wholesale markets on coal generators in Guangdong. For instance, net revenues for each category of coal generators would need to rise by more than 3.5 fold relative to the High Market Price scenario to enable more than 75% of all units are able to pay their full debt principal and interest. Increases in net revenues require an increase in market prices without a corresponding increase in short-run operating costs, implying a substantial increase in the number of hours in which gas or oil-fired generation is on the margin and a corresponding rise in average prices.

The difference between generator economics under the benchmark tariff and in wholesale markets explains why the transition to markets will be particularly difficult for less efficient coal units. Under the benchmark tariff, a 300 MW unit with 280 yuan/MWh operating costs that operates for 4000 h per year will earn 682 yuan/kW-yr (= 450.5 yuan/MWh – 280 yuan/MWh × 4000 h/yr × 1 MW/1000 kW) in net revenues. In a wholesale market, this unit may operate for only 2000 h per year and may often be the marginal generator or close to the marginal generator; if the average market clearing price when it operates is 350 yuan/MWh (its average revenues), it will earn 140 yuan/ kW-yr (= 350 yuan/MWh – 280 yuan/MWh × 2000 h/yr × 1 MW/ 1000 kW). Said differently, the historical combination of planned operating hours and the benchmark tariff maintained operating hours and net revenues for these units that were high relative to market outcomes.

To what extent would capacity payments ease the financial impact of wholesale market pricing on coal generators? Fig. 9 shows operating profit by coal generating unit, ranked from highest to lowest, for the three price scenarios (Benchmark, Low Market Price, High Market Price). In addition, Fig. 9 shows the effect on operating profits of paying generators an additional 100 yuan/kW-yr and 400 yuan/kW-yr in capacity payments in the Low Market Price scenario, with 100 yuan/kWyr representing a potential competitive price for capacity in an oversupplied market and 400 yuan/kW-yr representing a competitive price in a market in need of new investment (Lin et al., 2018).

modeling of economic dispatch in Guangdong. They are consistent with the province's generation mix, in which coal accounts for more than 80% of thermal generation.

In both the Low and High Market Price scenarios, coal generators are not able to repay their full annual debt interest and principal. In the Low Market Price scenario, only 20% of coal units (40% of capacity) are able pay their going forward fixed costs. In the High Market Price scenario, only two generating companies are able to pay their full annual debt interest.

As Fig. 9 shows, capacity payments—or equivalently some form of scarcity payments—could mitigate some, but not all, of the financial impact of market pricing on coal generators. With a 400 yuan/kW-yr capacity payment, generator operating profits are, on average, 25% less than they would be under the benchmark tariff. Thus, even when new investment is needed, competitive prices are likely to be lower than the benchmark tariff, raising the possibility of stranded investments.

5. Conclusions and policy inplications

Electricity markets are premised on the notion that generating companies take on more risk for investment cost recovery than utilities and independent generators did under a planned or regulated investment paradigm. This paper examined the implications of market reform for generation investment cost recovery in China, focusing on coal generation in Guangdong Province. Guangdong has announced plans to establish a spot market for electricity by 2019.

The analysis was based on Low Market Price (medium-level coal price, high hydro year) and High Market Price (high coal price, low hydro year) scenarios where average market prices are set by a midmerit (330–340 kgce/MWh) coal unit. These prices are based on

Nearly 20% of Guangdong's coal capacity is CHP. These units tend to be smaller and more expensive. However, the impact of electricity market pricing on CHP units is uncertain because a large fraction of their value may come from providing heat rather than electricity. The integration of CHP units into electricity markets in Guangdong, and in China more broadly, will have a significant impact on market outcomes because these units may be less sensitive to the operational and reliability needs of the electricity system. In U.S. independent system operator (ISO) operated markets, ISOs encourage greater flexibility from CHP units by requiring all generation, including CHP units, to be settled at spot market prices.

Coal generators in Guangdong have an estimated 94 billion yuan in total outstanding debt, with total estimated debt service payments of around 16 billion per year in 2016. The inability to service this debt would have significant implications for China's electricity sector, given both its size and the sector's heavy reliance on debt financing. It raises questions about the compatibility of competitive electricity markets, on the one hand, and state-owned generation companies that rely on state-owned banks for as much as 80% of their capital, on the other.

These results raise a natural question: Why would coal generators perform so poorly in Guangdong's electricity market? The main reason is that Guangdong has an excess of large baseload generation relative to what would be expected in a competitive market. Our market price scenarios (load-weighted average 302 yuan/MWh [US$44/MWh] and 371 yuan/MWh [$55/MWh]) are not abnormally low, relative to competitive electricity markets in other countries or to prices in

Guangdong's recent “live” market simulations. For instance, these prices are on par with or higher than recent day-ahead market costs in California (US$35/MWh to US$49/MWh from 2013 to 2017) (California Independent System Operator (CAISO), 2018). Daily average prices in Guangdong's market simulations were 289 yuan/ MWh on 16 May 2019 and 300 yuan/MWh on 15 May 2019, with prices ranging from 89 yuan/MWh to 447 yuan/MWh over these two days.5

However, large coal units have relatively high fixed O&M and investment costs, requiring high capacity factors (operating hours) and sustained high prices to generate the high net revenues that will allow for recovery of these costs. In Guangdong, LSEs would be unlikely to sign contracts with or build new coal units based on expected short-run energy market prices. The large number of existing coal units in Guangdong that would potentially be unable to recover their going forward fixed costs under near-term market pricing raises questions about the short-term political viability and reliability impacts of electricity markets in the province, and in China more broadly.

The challenge of how to deal with market impacts on coal generators in Guangdong and China involves two separate issues that may have a common solution. The first of these issues is transition: Guangdong has an excess of baseload coal generation capacity relative to what expected near-term market prices would be able to support. The second of these issues is long-term resource adequacy: existing coal generators that cannot pay their going forward fixed costs would be forced to mothball or retire.

Transition involves broader questions about the “compact” between the government and state-owned generation companies and banks: should the government allow companies and banks to recover investment costs for coal units that were constructed under a different policy and regulatory paradigm? Government agencies may decide to make transition payments to existing coal generators, in the interest of fairness, but delay dealing with mechanisms for long-term resource adequacy. The challenge with this approach will be in setting reasonable levels and duration for payments, ensuring that new generators are not eligible to receive transition payments, and avoiding creating new operational efficiencies.

Developing mechanisms for long-term resource adequacy would allow coal generators to recover at least some of their transition costs. Internationally, the two most widely used mechanisms for long-term resource adequacy are bilateral or centralized capacity markets, which are widely used in the United States, and scarcity pricing, which is used in the U.S. state of Texas and parts of Europe. If capacity market prices or scarcity prices are high—signaling the need for new investment—coal generator operating profits would be closer to, though still significantly lower than, existing benchmark tariffs. Which approach to long-term resource adequacy is most well-suited to China is beyond the scope of this paper, but implementing some form of longterm resource adequacy mechanism will help to ease concerns over generator financial impacts and reliability impacts during transition. A long-term resource adequacy mechanism may present a better balance between consumer savings and easing the financial impact of reforms on generators than making transition payments.

Regardless of approach, it is important that China's policymakers anticipate and address the impacts of electricity market reforms on existing coal generators, developing politically viable solutions. Electricity markets could play an important role in China's transition to a low-carbon energy system. However, if markets stumble on transition issues, their potential may not be realized.

7,Coordination between clean energy generation and thermal power generation under the policy of “direct power-purchase for large users” in China,"The inefficient utilization of clean energy and distorted pricing mechanism are the most critical problems that have hampered the reform of China's electric power industry for many years. A large number of clean energy generators have recently been constructed, but water spillage at hydroelectric facilities and wind curtailment persist due to integration challenges. The adjustment of electricity price has relied on executive orders of the Chinese government and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Distorted prices that are not derived from a market economy have seriously hampered the development of China's electricity market. Therefore, in recent years, the Chinese government has issued a number of reform measures concerning “direct power-purchase for large users”. The main idea of this pricing mechanism is to form direct negotiations between large users and generators to determine the electricity price. To a certain extent, this pricing mechanism is conducive to the electricity market reform in China. However, the coordination between clean energy generation and thermal power generation under the policy of “direct power-purchase for large users” has become the key issue in China's electric power industry. This paper summarizes the policies of “direct power-purchase for large users” in different provinces in China. The electricity market in Yunnan, for which the contradiction between thermal power generation and hydropower generation is increasingly severe, is the focus of the research. At last, a feasible electricity market scheme has been derived to coordinate thermal power generation and hydropower generation. This scheme has considerable theoretical and practical significance to the future of China's electricity market reform.","1. Introduction

During the past decades, the pricing mechanism of China's electric power industry was seriously distorted. Speciﬁcally, the grid enterprises buy power from generators at on-grid price and sell them to the users at the sale price of electricity (Pazheri et al., 2014; Omar et al., 2014; Ming et al., 2014a, b; Wang and Chen, 2012). The price of electricity is separated into different categories (for agricultural users, industrial users and so on) by the government. Different kinds of users (including residential users, agricultural users, industrial users and so on) will buy electricity from the grid enterprises at the price of electricity separately. Among those, both on-grid price and the price of electricity were determined by the NDRC (short for National Development and Reform Commission) according to the ﬁxed cost and variable cost of generators and grid enterprises, as shown in Fig. 1. Under this pricing mechanism, which is not market-oriented and objective, the price signal has lost its important guiding role in the market and has hindered electricity market reform in China for quite a long time (Bao and Fang. 2013; Zeng et al., 2014; Sovacool, 2009).

The Chinese government has started to carry out policies about DPLU (“direct power-purchase for large users”) since 2002 in order to solve this problem in a more market-oriented way (Zhao et al., 2012). This policy, which will form direct negotiations between large users and generators to determine the electricity price, has made some progress in promoting the market-oriented reform in China. At the same time, the problems of water spillage at hydroelectric facilities and the need for wind curtailment were becoming severe due to the blind expansion of clean generation without proper integration (Lion et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2011; The Central People's Government of The People's Republic of China (2013)). However, the present market operation of DPLU is still not quite conductive to the utilization of clean energy (Karami et al., 2013; Mark et al., 2014; Lejeune and Hui, 2012).

In the next few years, it is acknowledged that DPLU will be the key to electricity market reform in China. The utilization of clean energy as well as the coordination between thermal power generation and clean energy generation should be deliberately considered during the establishment of electricity market and power system operation (Zhao et al., 2014a; Pereira et al., 2014; Hirth, 2013). This paper focuses on Yunnan province as a case example, where the contradiction between thermal power generation and hydropower generation has signiﬁcantly hindered the operation of the electricity market. The second part of the article will address the status of implementation of DPLU and summarize the DPLU policies in different provinces. The development status, characteristics, and challenges of Yunnan's electric power industry will be analyzed in the third section The fourth part will give feasible recommendations. This article will end with some conclusions about the development of China's clean energy generation and electricity market reform.

2. The policy of DPLU

2.1. History of DPLU

The concept of DPLU was ﬁrst proposed by NEA (National Energy Administration) in 2002. However, during 2002e2010, the implementation of DPLU was not successful and has been hampered for various reasons (Ngan, 2010). With the rapid growth of China's demand for electricity and development of the electric power industry, the drawbacks of existing pricing mechanisms drew the attention of the government. In 2013, DPLU was once more proposed as a possible way to form a market-oriented pricing mechanism. After the formation of the new NEA, a large number of DPLU arrangements were carried out by the Central government and NEA (Wu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2014). This policy has become an important component of China's electricity market reform. Overall, the history of DPLU (shown in Fig. 2) can be separated into four stages.

(1) Stage 1: Concept formation

In 2002, the State Council issued The Electric Power Industry Reform Planning (The Central People's Government of The People's Republic of China (2002)). This government document stated that the all provincial governments should promote DPLU and change dominance of the market by grid enterprises (Ming et al., 2013a,

2013b; Xuegong et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013a, b). At the same time, the electricity price should be determined by both sides: the generators and the large users. This is the ﬁrst time the concept of DPLU was put forward.

In 2004, the former SERC (State Electricity Regulatory Commission) and the NDRC issued Interim Measures for Direct powerpurchase for large users (NEA, 2004; Xuegong et al., 2013). The guiding ideology, purposes and principles of DPLU were covered in this government document.

(2) Stage 2: Initial implementation

In 2005, Jilin Electric Power Supply Company, Jilin Carbon Company and Jilin Longhua Thermal Power Company signed contracts that ﬁrst implemented DPLU. In 2006, a large number of DPLU contracts were signed in the Guangdong province.

In June 2009, Notice on Improving the Implementation of Direct power-purchase for large users was carried out by the former SERC, NDRC, and NEA, which laid the foundation of policies and regulations for DPLU. Under the guidance of this government document, several DPLU contracts between Chalco Fushun Aluminum Company and Huaneng Yimin Generation Company were made (Valentine, 2014; Du et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013a, b).

(3) Stage 3: Rapid promotion

During 2010e2012, DPLU was hindered from different aspects. In 2013, the government realized that the traditional price mechanism has seriously hindered the process of China's electricity market reform. Since then, DPLU again became an important component of the reform of China's electric power industry.

In May 2013, the NDRC issued Deepening Economic Reform in 2013, which listed DPLU as one of the key ways to promote the reform of the energy sector (Xinhuanet, 2013; Zhao et al., 2012). In August, NEA issued Notice on Relative Factors of Direct powerpurchase for large users, which ﬁrst promoted the idea that market should be the critical factor in the allocation of resources.

In October 2013, NEA issued Regulations on Direct powerpurchase for large users, which further described the rights and obligations of participants of DPLU (Netease, 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Since DPLU has become fully market-oriented, the administrative approval of transactions of DPLU is no longer necessary.

(4) Stage 4: Large-scale implementation

As of November 2013, DPLU has been implemented in 11 provinces, including Yunnan, Jilin, Guangdong, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Gansu.

In 2014, the volume of DPLU for Guangdong reached 210 million kWh. In addition, a large number of users will participate in the DPLU in Sichuan, including many well-known companies such as China Changhong Company, China Er-zhong Company, and so on. In Shanxi, contracts between 13 large users and 6 generators plants have been signed.

For now, in most provinces in China, the NDRC and the Central Government decide the price of electricity and on-grid price. So there is not a full functional electricity market in China and the wholesale electricity market and the retail segment are not obviously separated, since the price of electricity and on-grid price are all decided by government. From the history of DPLU described above, we can conclude that the present mechanism is considered inefﬁcient and that the government is trying to build an adaptive market mechanism.

A ﬁeld survey of DPLU practice suggests conﬁrms that DPLU will encourage direct negotiations between large users and generators. Under a DPLU arrangement, both generators and users have the right to bid into the market. In the bidding process, generators and users will submit their acceptable transaction price. After negotiation, the generators will sell the electricity to grid enterprises at the transaction price. The price of electricity contains four parts (for the most provinces in China): the transaction price, a transmission and distribution charge, a line-loss charge, and government fees. The transaction price is determined by the negotiation and the government determines the other charges and also receives the government fees.

2.2. DPLU policies of different provinces

At present, DPLU has been implemented in several provinces in China. The provincial governments have implemented policies to guide DPLU transactions. These policies are summarized brieﬂy in Table 1 and in the following observations.

First, we observe similar pricing structures. In most provinces, users will buy power at the price consists of the transaction price, transmission and distribution charge, and government fees (Lin and Liu, 2013). In addition, in most provinces, the line-loss charge is a key components of transmission and distribution price. However, in Guangdong, Anhui, Hunan, and Yunnan, the line-loss charge will be independent of transmission and distribution

price. In sum, the transaction price has replaced on-grid price with signiﬁcant market features.

Second, we observe diversity in transactions and negotiations. In addition to traditional negotiations and meetings, some provincial governments have built a transaction platform to promote DPLU through information technology. Users and generators can search for and complete transactions through the platform. Obviously, this will improve the efﬁciency of electricity market.

Third, we observe various participants. For the users, some provinces, such as Guangdong and Jiangsu, encourage the users with high energy efﬁciency and low gas emission to participate in the electricity market, For the generators, most participants are thermal power plants. Yunnan, where the market is dominated by hydropower plants, is the exception.

Overall, DPLU will be an important breakthrough for China's electricity market reform. However, under the current implementation of DPLU, most participants are thermal power plants. With the continuous improvement of market mechanisms as well as the development of new generation technologies, clean energy will become an important part of China's electricity market. Therefore, coordination between clean energy generation and thermal power generation has become an important research topic. Hence the experience with DPLU in Yunnan, where the electric power system is mainly composed of hydropower generation, is very relevant.

3. Environmental analysis of DPLU in Yunnan province

3.1. Characteristics of Yunnan's electric power industry

Yunnan province is located in the southwest of China; the altitude of northern part of Yunnan is relatively high while the southern part is low (YPIITC, 2014). The Jinsha River, Lancang River and many other tributaries of the Yangtze River ﬂow through Yunnan. Annual precipitation of Yunnan is more than 1100 mm. Therefore, Yunnan is rich in hydropower resources, which is why hydropower generation is the main means of meeting the power demand in Yunnan. To be speciﬁc, the characteristics of Yunnan's electric power industry are as follows. (1) High proportion of hydropower generation

In the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the Yunnan government continued to propel the construction of large hydropower plants. A number of large hydropower plants, including Xi Luodu, Nuo Zhadu, Li Yuan, A Hai have been put into operation (Zeng et al., 2014; Rangel, 2008; Amponsah et al., 2014). Hydropower plants below 500 MW have also been developed. In 2008, the installed capacity of hydropower generation exceeds that of thermal power generation; over the next three years, the power supply structure was mainly composed of hydropower generation, supplemented by thermal power generation.

Fig. 3. Installed capacity of Yunnan during 2009e2013. Source: CEC (2014).

The total installed capacity of Yunnan reached 57788 MW and the installed capacity of hydropower generation accounted for about 70% of the total installed capacity. The proportion of thermal power generation was about 20%. The installed capacity and power supply of Yunnan during 2009e2013 is shown in Figs. 3 and 4.

As its current status shows, Yunnan has made full use of abundant hydropower resources to implement the low-carbon development strategies that were promulgated by Central Government in recent years. However, the development and use of hydropower generation are seriously inﬂuenced by seasonal effects (Jaramillo et al., 2010; Forsund, 2013; Johnsen, 2001). There is large gap between the power supply of the wet season and dry season. The monthly power supply of Yunnan is shown in Fig. 5.

As illustrated in Fig. 5, the year in Yunnan can be separated into three periods: dry season (from January to April); wet season (from June to November); and normal season (from May to December). Thus, the power supply of hydropower generation is closely related with precipitation and seasonal effects. When the hydropower generation is inadequate, thermal power plants must increase their output of generators to compensate for the lack of hydropower generation (Akpmar, 2013).

(2) Complex ownership structure

The ownership structure of hydropower plants in Yunnan is rather complicated. The large hydropower plants in Yunnan, (greater than 500 MW), belong to different generation enterprises (Table 2). Some generation enterprises are controlled by the Central Government and some are controlled by Yunnan provincial government. The present situation has brought difﬁculties to the coordination of the different hydropower plants in Yunnan.

(3) Slowdown of power demand growth

During the Twelfth Five-Year Plan period, there was rapid development in various industries of Yunnan and electricity consumption increased (Paraschiv et al., 2014). In 2011, the annual growth of power consumption peaked at 19.92%. In 2012, 2013, with the deepening of industrial restructuring in Yunnan, along with pessimism about China's economy, the development of Yunnan's industry was hindered, therefore the growth of power consumption fell to 9.28% and 10.94%. The power consumption of various industry of Yunnan is shown in Fig. 6. The broken line in the ﬁgure is the growth of power consumption.

At the same time, a secondary industry for nonferrous metals is the pillar industry of Yunnan, for which power consumption is much higher than for other industries. The ferrous metals industry, the nonmetal industry, and the chemical industry follow the nonferrous metals industry (Liu et al., 2013b; Tang and Zhou, 2012; Dombi et al., 2014; Lam and Shiu, 2001). The power consumption of the different industrial sectors Yunnan is illustrated in Fig. 7. 3.2. Existing problems of Yunnan's electric power industry

Yunnan has made full use of its hydropower resources and has achieved emissions reductions under the traditional market mechanism. However, in recent years, with the changing internal and external environment of Yunnan Province, the electric power industry of Yunnan is facing with many troublesome issues that the existing market mechanism cannot solve properly, as summarized here.

(1) Limited consumption of hydropower generation

Recently, the overall economic situation of the China has negatively affected industrial development in Yunnan. From January 2013 to August 2014, the PPI (Producer Price Index) of the pillar industries of Yunnan continued to decline as compared with former years. As the data show an average decline in the PPI for ferrous metals (4.2%), nonferrous metals (4.6%), the nonmetal industry (2.2%), and the chemical industry (2.2%). The PPI of pillar industries is shown in Table 3.

Affected by the economic situation, the recent power consumption growth in these pillar industries also has decelerated

Fig. 8. Growth of power consumption of pillar industries. Source: YPIITC (2014).

(Villemeur and Vinella, 2011; Zhao et al., 2011, 2014a, b; Huang and Yan, 2009; Philpott et al., 2010) as shown in Fig. 8. During 2012, 2013, the growth of power consumption for pillar industries fell sharply. Negative growth appeared for the ferrous metals industry in 2013 (Zhou et al., 2014; Wang, 2014). Power consumption in Yunnan is so limited that without industrial growth or incentives from the pricing mechanism, the problem of water spillage will become worse. In addition, a number of new hydropower plants will be constructed and put into production in 2015, and the installed capacity will reach 7962 MW. Undoubtedly, this will make the present situation of mismatched supply and demand even worse.

(2) Severe situation of thermal power generation

During the past few years, the Yunnan provincial government has expanded hydropower planning rather blindly, which has seriously affected the development and operation of thermal power plants. In the operation of Yunnan's electric power industry, hydropower generation has the highest priority due to requirements for carbon emissions reduction. In addition, the cost of thermal power generation is much higher than that of hydropower; therefore its market competitiveness is so poor that the business status of thermal power plants has worsened in recent years (CSHE, 2014). The utilization hours of thermal power generation and hydropower generation in 2013 are shown in Fig. 9. The utilization hours in the past ﬁve years are illustrated in Fig. 10.

The utilization hours for hydropower generation exceeded thermal power generation in 2012. In 2013, the utilization hours for thermal power generation dropped sharply. It is difﬁcult for thermal power plants to survive under the present situation. However, hydropower generation is seriously effected by precipitation; when the dry season comes, thermal power generation is key to meeting power demand. Moreover, precipitation is difﬁcult to predict. If precipitation for the entire year is lower than predicted, thermal power generation is essential for the stable and safe operation of Yunnan's electric power industry. Hence, it is of great importance to maintain the prosperous operation of thermal power plants.

(3) Coordination among hydropower plants

There are signiﬁcant differences between the market dominated by hydropower plants and the market dominated by thermal power plants. Hydropower plants located at different cascades of the river are separated into two categories: upstream plants and downstream plants. Hence, it is very important to coordinate hydropower plants at different cascades to meet power demand and the requirements for safe operation of electric power system. As an example, the geographic map of hydropower plants (with the installed capacity greater than 200 MW) on Lancang River is provided in Fig. 11.

As seen in the illustration, hydropower plants are located at different cascades. Here we will illustrate and compare market operations under the current situation and under DPLU.

Under the current situation (without DPLU), on-grid price and the price of electricity are all decided by the NDRC and the Central Government; the market is highly controlled by administrative means. Economic dispatch is used to operate system and there is no ability of generators to exercise market power; power from hydropower plants with lower on-grid price will be transmitted to the users with priority. Administrative dispatch is an ancillary option. When generation fails to meet the demand of users, the dispatch center for the grid enterprises will let the hydropower plants with high ﬂexibility increase production (for example, in Da Chaoshan, where the on-grid price are relatively low). In sum. Because the market is controlled by the government, the complex ownership of hydropower plants will not affect market operation. At the same time, the system operation is controlled by the dispatch center, and the cascading effects of hydropower plants is not obvious.

Under the implementation of DPLU, the situation becomes more complicated and two problems might emerge. The ﬁrst is the cascading effect. The market will not be fully controlled by the government and competition will affect operation of the electricity market. If one upstream hydropower plant fails to compete and begins to store water, downstream plants will not be able to generate power. Because it will destabilize operation of electric power system in Yunnan, this competitive result should be prevented. A second problem concerns ownership of hydropower plants. In Lancang River, seven hydropower plants have already been put into production; ﬁve belong to China Huaneng Group Ltd., and two belong to SDIC and China Southern Power Grid Company. In 2015, the construction of Miao Wei and Huang Deng will be ﬁnished; they are all controlled by China Huaneng Group Ltd. The market power of large generation enterprises should be taken into consideration during the establishment of the electricity market.

(4) Complicated electricity pricing

In most provinces of China, in order to smooth the load curve, the price of electricity is divided into three categories: peak, normal, and valley. The aim of this policy is to realize load shifting by guiding users to shift their load from peak hours to valley hours. However, in Yunnan, where the electric power industry is dominated by hydropower plants, the year has been separated into the

wet, dry, and normal seasons (as described above). Under the traditional pricing mechanism, the on-grid price are separated into three categories according to the time of year.

If DPLU is carried out, generators and users will have to submit the transaction price according to six aspects: peak hours, normal hours, valley hours, wet season, dry season, and normal season. This complicated bidding mechanism will make it difﬁcult for both sides to make deals and reduce the operational efﬁciency of the electricity market, so a rational bidding mechanism will be needed.

3.3. DPLU: possible solution to existing problems

The core idea of DPLU is to form direct negotiations between users and generators. This new market mechanism may be the best solution to the existing problems in Yunnan province, for reasons that follow.

First, market efﬁciency (especially production efﬁciency) will be greatly improved. Under the former pricing mechanism, the ongrid price were determined by the government. Since 2012, the generators have put much effort into the negotiation with the government, rather than reducing generation costs or increasing production efﬁciency. Because almost all generators are controlled by the Central Government, it is quite easy for them to get high ongrid price. However, with implementation of DPLU, the on-grid price will be determined by the market, so there will be only two ways for generators to increase their proﬁts: negotiate with users to get high on-grid price or reduce generation costs. The former way will be much more difﬁcult, since the market now in Yunnan is obviously a buyer's market. This will force the generators to reduce costs and improve production efﬁciency.

Second, the enhanced enthusiasm of users is conductive to solving the present problems. Under the current pricing mechanism, the electricity price for industrial users is much higher than for residential users due to cross subsidization. However, the price of electricity was decided by the government. Therefore, no matter how the economic situation changes, users do not have the chance to lower their power costs. On one hand, when economic conditions are unfavorable and sales are down, users have no incentive to increase production and power consumption will continue to decline (El Bassam et al., 2013). This worsens the problem of power spillage. On the other hand, when economic conditions turn for the better and users increase production, electricity consumption will rise. The high price of electricity will continue to encumber users in terms of their production and power consumption. Surplus hydropower supply will not be consumed and, again, the existing problems will not be solved (NDRC, 2007). The DPLU policy will encourage users to take part in the electricity market and negotiate with generators to reduce their electricity costs. Users may beneﬁt from increased productivity and proﬁtability and hydropower plants may beneﬁt from the use of surplus generation, achieving a “winewin” situation.

In a word, the present distorted pricing mechanism has become a critical issue. Hence the government must provide users a market-oriented way to negotiate and decide the price of electricity. DPLU appears to be the proper solution.

In fact, in June and July of 2014, Yunnan province has built a primary electricity market among more than 100 large users and 10 hydropower plants. This primary electricity market has helped to consume surplus hydropower generation (3198.65 GWh), which is of great signiﬁcance in reducing water spillage and promoting the development of local industry. Market transactions in June and July of 2014 are shown in Table 4 and Table 5.

Because hydropower generation is abundant in Yunnan, the electricity market is a buyer's market and negotiation will reduce the price of electricity. The average price of electricity is much lower than the price of electricity under the former pricing mechanism decided by the NDRC. This result suggests that the price signals are seriously distorted under the traditional pricing mechanism. There appears to be much room for hydropower plants to reduce the price and encourage users to increase their production and power consumption.

The primary market has made great strides in consuming surplus hydropower generation. However, the problem of water spillage is still serious and the business status of thermal power plants is worsening as well. Therefore, in the next stage of electricity market establishment in Yunnan, the market should be further expanded. Some solutions are elaborated in the following sections.

4. Solutions

The existing problems in Yunnan, which are basically the inharmonious coordination between clean generation and thermal power generation, cannot be solved in the short term. Hence, solutions should be separated into stages. Section 4.1 suggests solutions for the near future (within 5 years), Section 4.2 suggests solutions for the long term (during the next 5e10 years).

4.1. Solutions in the near future

This section reviews the near-term solutions that have already been approved the by Yunnan provincial government. These are related to market design, coordination, and pricing.

(1) Further expansion of market

In the implementation of DPLU in 2014, only a few large users and hydropower plants were chosen to participate and thus consume some of the surplus hydropower generation. However water spillage is still serious (National Research Center for Sustainable Hydropower Development, 2014). In the next few years, however, the overall economic situation for the pillar industries in Yunnan is predicted to improve due to the policy support of the Central Government (promotion of Western Development). Therefore, the implementation of DPLU should be further expanded in order to encourage more users to participate (People's Government of Yunnan Province, 2014).

Three additional recommendations can be made. First of all, residential users and agricultural users, for which electric power consumption is much lower than for industrial users, should not be considered as large users and take part in the DPLU; prices for them are determined under the traditional pricing mechanism. Under this mechanism, the electricity price for residential users and for agricultural users is relatively low to guarantee minimum living standards, Their lack of competitiveness suggests that it is better for them not to participate in the DPLU in the next few years.

Second, except for residential and agricultural users, all users should participate in the DPLU. On the generation side, all hydropower plants should take part in the DPLU in order to consume surplus hydropower generation and relieve the problem of water spillage. The detailed market design will be discussed below.

Finally, Yunnan is an important part of West-East power transmission project. The power generated in Yunnan will be transmitted through the main grid to Guangdong province (National Research Center for Sustainable Hydropower Development, 2014). The West-East power transmission project between Yunnan and Guangdong in 2012 and 2013 is shown in Fig. 12.

Guangdong, with a large number of large users, has consumed plenty of surplus hydropower generation from Yunnan. It is worth noting that the generation transmitted to Guangdong in 2013 was much higher than in 2012. It is estimated that this trend will continue in the next few years. Therefore, more large users in Guangdong should be encouraged to take part in the DPLU and form direct negotiations with the generators of Yunnan. This will further promote the industrial development of Guangdong and relief the problem of water spillage in Yunnan.

(2) Independent thermal power generation market

The cost of generation from thermal power plants in Yunnan is much higher than that for hydropower plants due to construction costs and the high price of coal. Along with China's development strategy of energy conservation and pollution reduction, thermal power plants lack competitiveness under DPLU compared with hydropower plants. The implementation of DPLU may let the hydropower plants provide power to the users supplied by the thermal power plants, making the business operation of the thermal power plants even worse. Based on this analysis, purely market-oriented methods will not be the solution for the thermal power plants and administrative measures should be introduced (Ming et al., 2013b). An independent market between thermal power plants and a share of the large-user market should be built to ensure the basic business operation of the thermal power plants.

We can suggest from these ﬁrst two observations that in the next 5 years, the electricity market of Yunnan might consist of three parts: an administrative market, a thermal power generation market, and a DPLU market.

The administrative market mainly consists of residential and agricultural users. For political reasons, the cross subsidization should not be eliminated in China in the next few years, so these users will be separated from the original market. The on-grid price and price of electricity for these users will continued to be decided by the NDRC and the Central Government. These users will be supplied with power from hydropower plants with low on-grid price (like Da Chaoshan) at a sale price relatively low compared with industrial users. In other words, the administrative market is not actually a “market.” The aim of this design is to improve people's livelihoods and realize universal service in the electric power industry.

In the thermal power generation market, only thermal power plants can participate. The goal is to maintain the general business operation of the thermal power plants. Therefore, a small number of users (other than the users in the administrative market) will be separated from the original market and negotiate with thermal power plants only. These users may be chosen from those paying relatively high prices under the original pricing mechanism since they are already accustomed to paying higher prices. This policy will invoke fairness issues. The users paying high electricity price under the traditional pricing mechanism are the ones who have the strongest incentives to participate in the DPLU. To solve this problem, subsidies may be a remedy. Subsidies could be given to these users to cover the losses caused by their non-participation in the DPLU. Subsidies could be based on the gap between the transaction price for thermal power generation and the average transaction price for DPLU users belonging to the same user categories. When the thermal power plants fail to meet the power demand of these users, hydropower plants will increase their generation to ﬁll the void.

The users (other than those in the administrative or thermal power generation markets) will take part in the DPLU and negotiate with power plants directly. The market structure of DPLU in Yunnan in the near future is shown in Fig. 13. This approach will ensure people's livelihoods and realize universal service goals. At the same time, the general business operation of thermal power plants will be assured and consumption of surplus hydropower generation will increase. This approach may be feasible in the next ﬁve years, but in the long term, concerns about fairness will grow and a fully functioning market without subsidies will be needed. We discuss these issues below.

(3) Mechanism for tradable generation rights

In an electricity market dominated by hydropower plants, a mechanism for tradable generation rights is of great importance. However, precipitation is difﬁcult to predict with accuracy and hydropower resources cannot be guaranteed. When hydropower generation is inadequate to meet the power demand of users in Yunnan, thermal power plants will have to increase generation to supplement supplies. Thermal power plants could buy generation rights from hydropower plants to ensure the safe and stable operation of the system. The market design could thus include DPLU market negotiation, generation rights trading, power

dispatch, and generation rights trading after power dispatch.

A trading mechanism is complicated when it is associated with power dispatch. After the negotiation, hydropower plants will predict generation for the next few days to estimate weather the terms of deal can be fulﬁlled or not. If not, hydropower plants have to sell part of the generation rights to thermal power plants who will need to increase output to meet the rest part of the generation needs. These transactions will be submitted to dispatch center, which ensures the safe operation of system. Generation rights trading facilitates negotiations between hydropower plants and thermal power plants and as well as enforcement in the case of a breach of contract.

(4) Coordination between hydropower plants by administrative measures

In the near future, “safety, economy and environmental protection” must be key to establishing the electricity market with DPLU. The power demand of users in Yunnan must be fulﬁlled safely and steadily through the coordination among hydropower plants. However, as with the thermal power plants, this problem cannot be solved through purely market-oriented methods and administrative measures should be introduced. The access rules of DPLU should require hydropower plants to obey the dispatch orders of grid enterprises and administrative orders of the government. When there is a need to discharge water to ensure the generation of downstream hydropower plants and meet the power demand of users, the upstream plants must follow these orders to coordinate operations (Zhang et al., 2012).

The ownership of hydropower plants in Yunnan another challenge. In Lancang River, most hydropower plants are controlled by China Huaneng Croup LTd. In order to avoid market control by large hydropower plants belonging to the same generation enterprises. Setting a price ceiling and ﬂoor might be a better policy option and, in any case, a long-term solution is needed.

(5) More ﬂexible pricing mechanism

M. Zeng et al. / Utilities Policy 33 (2015) 10e22

As discussed above, the price of electricity in Yunnan is separated into several categories. If the bidding mechanism of DPLU follows the former categories, this will surely reduce the efﬁciency of market operation. Therefore, a more ﬂexible pricing mechanism should be built. Users and hydropower plants will negotiate and submit at only one transaction price. During the dry season and peak hours, the transaction price will increase proportionally; in the wet season and valley hours, the transaction price will decrease proportionally. This mechanism will reduce the complexity of the bidding mechanism and enhance the efﬁciency of market operation. This ﬂexible pricing mechanism is shown in Table 6.

4.2. Solutions in the long term

The solutions outlined in section 4.1 are part of the implementation plan for Yunnan's electricity market in 2015. However, except for the ﬂexible pricing mechanism (which can simplify the complex pricing mechanism), the other solutions can only help to consume surplus hydropower generation in the short term. If the expansion of hydropower generation continues, the solutions above will not work in the long run. Long-term solutions are needed to address these problems completely, as discussed here.

(1) Optimized generation planning

The problem of water spillage and the conﬂict between hydropower generation and thermal power generation stem from blind expansion planning for generation. It is well-known that the expansion of hydropower generation has fulﬁlled the requirements of air pollution reduction and the national renewable energy development strategy, but it also has ignored the fact that the power consumption of Yunnan is limited. Market-oriented policy will resolve theses problems in the short term by stimulating power consumption. To resolve this problem completely, generation planning should be further optimized. This solution can be separated into two phases.

Phase 1: Optimization for existing generation planning. Undoubtedly, generation planning for Yunnan and most of China during the past decades has been unscientiﬁc and suboptimal. The consequences cannot be remedied in the short term. Over the next 10 years (especially after 2020), generators that are technologically backward, should be eliminated and replaced with plants that have higher efﬁciency and lower emissions. This step should be performed gradually and a carbon trade market might help accelerate the updating process.

Phase 2: Changing the electric power system planning mechanism. Optimized planning among all kinds of generators is the key to promoting clean energy. Thermal power plants will become an important peaking resource for power generation. Today, planning for the entire electric power system is all decided by the NDRC and the Central Government and most of these government ofﬁcials are not professionals in electric power systems. Therefore, in the long run, the system for planning should be changed. A professional planning committee should be established to make key decisions. During generation expansion planning, the characteristics of all types of energy generation should be taken into consideration. Expansion planning must provide the basis for coordination between clean energy generation and thermal power generation in the electricity market. The ﬁnal purpose of generation planning is to meet the power demands of the whole society safely as well as fulﬁll the requirements of energy conservation and environmental protection.

(2) Full market-oriented reform

The solutions presented in section 4.1 are partly marketoriented; a full market-oriented reform is essential in the long term. Large industrial users are the most important participants in the electricity market in Yunnan; however, the surplus hydropower generation cannot be fully consumed by the large users. When the overall economic situation of China turns bad, large users in Yunnan will not have sufﬁcient incentives to increased production and surplus hydropower generation will again become a serious problem. Hence in the long run, two policies should be carried out.

First, residential and agricultural users should take part in the electricity market to make it complete. Cross subsidization will be eliminated with the expansion of DPLU. However, in order to ensure the basic livelihoods of residents and protect the agricultural sector, a price ceiling policy may be needed. Retail companies should be established to gather (or “aggregate”) these users and negotiate with generators. When that happens, China's wholesale and retail electricity markets will be fully functional.

Second, the independent thermal power generation market will be eliminated gradually. According to this policy, the Yunnan provincial government will replace outdated thermal power plants and with competitive thermal power plants of higher efﬁciency, lower emissions, and lower costs. Power in Yunnan will be generated by clean energy plants (mainly hydropower plants) and advanced thermal power plants.

(3) Diversiﬁed ownership of hydropower plants

Coordination among hydropower plants should be achieved in order to improve the economic efﬁciency and rationality of the electricity market. The underlying market manipulation brought by some hydropower plants belonging to the same generation enterprises should be prevented. Administrative measures are always needed, but market-oriented methods are the key to solve them thoroughly. Hence in the long term, more diversiﬁed generation enterprises should be invited to invest in the existing hydropower plants in Yunnan to relieve the situation of one generation enterprise controlling many hydropower plants. The ultimate solution is to create fair competition in the electricity market.

4.3. Experiences from Yunnan Province

Some experiences and policies from Yunnan Province are applicable to other geographic locations where hydropower generation potential is not as prominent or where renewable energy generation mainly comes from wind or solar.

First, optimized generation planning will help to achieve coordination between thermal power generation and clean energy generation. One sensible way to solve the present challenge of clean energy generation (other than by advanced technological means) is to let thermal power generation serve peak loads. Therefore, the system should be built with a reasonable ratio between thermal power generation and clean energy generation. During the generation planning period, the characteristics of different kinds of generators (including ramp rate and so on) should be taken into consideration. The expanded planning of thermal power plants with high generation efﬁciency and ﬂexibility should be encouraged in order to provide peaking capacity during system operation; at the same time, the outdated thermal power plants with high emissions should be eliminated. The planning and construction of clean energy generators should be carried out accordingly to provide a basis for the coordination among all generators.

Second, an independent market will help guarantee the role of clean energy generators. Limited market space is one of the most knotty problems that has hindered the development of clean energy. This problem will not be solved through full market-oriented solutions at present, so administrative means are recommended (Sovacool, 2009; Jin et al., 2014). Establishing an independent market will force some users to consume clean energy generation and expand the underlying market space.

This policy is suitable to various kinds of clean energy generation. However, he applicability of the Yunnan experience may be limited by the unique characteristics of hydropower generation. First, hydropower generation is more predictable and controllable compared with solar and wind energy, so the coordination between hydropower generation and thermal power generation is not that difﬁcult technically. When it comes to other sources of clean energy generation, the optimized planning approach described here may not work and other coordination methods may be needed.

Second, power quality is seriously reduced due to the instability of clean energy generation. Hydropower generation is quite stable compared with solar and wind. Therefore, the users who buy clean energy generation will bear the loss caused by poor power quality. A combination of clean energy generation and ﬂexible thermal power generation to meet peak load may be a feasible solution to this problem.

5. Conclusions

DPLU, which forms direct negotiations between power users and generators to decide the transaction price of electricity, will be a critical factor to improving efﬁciency in China's electricity market. At the same time, the promotion of clean energy generation is of great importance in realizing energy conservation and pollution reduction. Therefore, the coordination between clean energy generation and thermal power generation under the policy of DPLU is of great signiﬁcance in the future development of the market. This paper has taken Yunnan as an example to illustrate the existing challenges in the electric power industry.

Several market-oriented solutions are proposed based on the establishment of DPLU to improve coordination in generation. First, the electricity market should be further expanded. In the short term, only large users can take part in the DPLU; in the long term, all users should participate in the DPLU. Second, independent market should be built in the short term to improve the business operation of thermal power plants. Over time, the coordination between thermal power generation and hydropower generation should be realized through the planning, construction, and operation of the electric power system. The ultimate purpose is to meet the power demands of the whole society safely as well as fulﬁll the requirements of energy conservation and environmental protection. Third, the ownership of hydropower plants in Yunnan should be further diversiﬁed to achieve coordination among hydropower plants and avoid market manipulation by generation enterprises. Last but not least, a more ﬂexible pricing mechanism should be built to improve the operational efﬁciency of electricity market.

In the implementation plan for the electricity market of Yunnan, thermal power plants and hydropower plants are the only

participants on the generation side. Across China, however, there are many provinces with abundant wind and solar energy. With the development of clean energy generation in China, wind power plants and photovoltaic power stations should become important participants in the electricity market. Compared with hydropower generation, wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation are more intermittent and unstable. Their cost also is relatively high. Questions about how to improve the competitiveness of clean energy generation and achieve coordination with thermal power generation remain important to the future of DPLU and the market. Future research will consider case studies of DPLU implementation in other provinces in China; the functions and practices of DPLU in China's ongoing retail electricity market restructuring; and the eventual settlement of cross-subsidization issues among different categories of electricity consumers."
8,Cost of long distance electricity transmission in China,"China's energy resources reserves are concentrated on the central and western regions. Meanwhile, the major energy demand is distributed in the eastern region. Large scale of cross-regional electricity transmission is implemented to guarantee the power supply. The long distance electricity transmission (LDET) cost is an essential component of the final detail price. This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the real cost of LDET, which mainly focuses on the price mark-up between the electricity exporter and importer. A weighted least square regression model is applied to evaluate the influence of the factors that could impact the real operating cost of the LDET. Furthermore, we apply the LDET cost model to evaluate the synthesize cost of renewable energy, and find the current renewable policy of China is inefficient.","1. Introduction

In 2011, China's total generating capacity reached 4.47 trillion kilowatt-hour (kWh), surpassing the 4.1 trillion kWh of the United States, and becoming the largest electricity consumption country in the world (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2012). Meanwhile, the distribution of power resources is imbalanced, which means load center of electricity is usually far away from the supply side. In 2014, the annual cross-transmission of electricity in China was 274.1 billion kWh. The interprovincial transmission volume of electricity was 842 billion kWh, which accounted for 15.3% of the total electricity consumption (China Electricity Council, 2015). Meanwhile, the electricity demand still keep growth fast with the growth of economic (Lin and Liu, 2016). To this end, huge resources were invested in transmission lines each year. As we can see in the Fig. 1, the grid investment exceeded the generator investment since 2013, and the growth rate of grid is higher than the generator.

The transmission and distribution (T & D) of electricity are deemed as a natural monopoly industry. In China, the T & D network is monopolized by two giant institutions: State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid. As nature monopoly industry, the eﬃcient of electricity transmission demand relies on monopoly supplier (Kaserman and Mayo, 1991; Joskow, 1997). Meanwhile, the government should regulate the electricity price according to the T & D cost.

The pricing of transmission is an important work of regulation. The last cycle of China's electricity market reform was implemented in 2002 (Ming et al., 2013), which had proposed to accounting the transmission price independently. In fact, since there is no competitive electricity market in China, the T & D cost is opacity to the public. Wang and Chen (2012) ﬁgured out that the monopoly in China's electricity market will be harmful to public welfare. In order to improve the regulation mechanisms of T & D industry, the Chinese government launched a new round of reform for the electricity market since 2015 (Zeng et al., 2016). In March 2015, The State Council of China (2015) released a document named “the several opinions for the further reform on electricity market”, which indicated that the goal of the electricity reform was to separate the T & D process from retailing. One of the key points of the electricity reform is to check the real costs of T & D. In March 2016, The National Development and Reform Commission (2016) published executive orders to require the grid submitting the base price of T & D before October 2016.

In practice, it's very hard to ﬁnd out the real cost of electricity transmission due to the power grid is a complex network, and there exist kinds of cross subsidizations and circuits (Brown and Sedano, 2004). The cost contains the investment and transmission loss in the transmission line and the transformer substation. The previous studies major focus on the transmission loss. Conejo et al. (2002) compared the diﬀerent practical algorithms of transmission loss. Tan and Lie (2001) considered the loss cost in the electricity price. Few literatures focus on the real running cost of transmission. Li et al. (2015) compared the technology and costs between coal transportation and electricity transmission. But the calculation methodology of electricity transmission cost is not described in their papers. He et al. (2015) analyzed the electricity transmission and distribution tariﬀ mechanism from the point of view of sustainable development. Besides, some researchers focus on the transmission cost combined with renewable. Labordena and Lilliestam (2015) considered the transmission cost of solar electricity from desert. You et al. (2016) considered the transmission expansion with wind power.

The main contribution of this article is that a new methodology to estimate the real cost of LDET is proposed. In our theory, the market price reﬂects all the factors that may impact the cost, and we can estimate the ﬁnal cost from the price markup between diﬀerent districts. From the ﬁnancial statements of the state grid, we can see that the economic proﬁt of the grid is close to zero. In general, the diﬀerence of the marginal feed-in tariﬀs between diﬀerent provinces reﬂects the real cost of electricity transmission. Due to the transmission capacity between provinces is diﬀerent; this paper uses the weighted least square (WLS) method to deal with this problem.

Besides the factor of long distance electricity transmission (LDET) cost, the price mark-up may also be aﬀected by the relation between market supply and demand. In general, the lower the local electricity supply ratio is, the higher price mark-up will be. In addition, a high peak-valley price deviation can reﬂect the imbalance of intra-day electricity demand, and may increase the electricity supply cost. This paper adds two dummy valuables to consider the impact of these two factors.

According to the regression model, we can estimate the ﬁnal real cost of the LDET. Though this method ignores the micro details in the power network, the results can reﬂect the overall cost from supply side to demand side. The LDET model considers the marginal cost of the transmission distance and provides beneﬁt information for the policy maker. For example, the LDET cost model can be applied in some macro level analysis such as the analysis of power generator allocation. This paper illustrates two application cases to show how the LDET cost model can be applied in the policy evaluation. By internalize the external LDET cost, we can draw a conclusion that the current renewable energy policy provide a distorted incentives and cause ineﬃcient power allocation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the analysis framework of this study, including the description of the basic assumptions, methodology and data sources. Section 3 presents the results of the study, including the optimal transmission volume and path, and the WLS regression result. Section 4 followed by a discussion. Some application cases are also presented in this part. Conclusions as well as recommendations for future analysis are drawn in Section 5.

2. Methodology and data

The power grid is a network which contains many circuits. To accurate evaluate the cost of LDET, it may need to implement the power ﬂow analysis and analyze the cost of each circuit. But for some applications, such as policy evaluation, we may only concerns about the cost of net transmission, which can be seen as ﬁnal cost. This section proposes a new method to calculate the ﬁnal cost of LDET base on some rational economic assumption, which ignores the complicated process and only reﬂects the cost of the net transmission.

2.1. The basic assumption

To estimate the cost of LDET, we need to know the transmission relationship between each district. In reality, the cost data of LDET is not open to the public, and even the regulator. We can only acquire the electricity balance data of each province. The net transmission volume between each province is unknown. In addition, some provinces only play the role as intermediate, which making the problem more complicated. To get the datasets of regression, we need to make some reasonable assumptions.

Assumption 1. The power grid is a rational economic agent. The choice between LDET and local supply follows the principle in Eq. (1). Where C i means the marginal electricity feed-in tariﬀ of the electricity input province; C o means the marginal electricity feed-in tariﬀ of the electricity output province; C T mean the cost of LDET. This equation imply that if the cost of long distance transmission is lower than the cost of local supply, the power grid will increase the volume of long distance transmission. When in the condition of market clear, the cost of LDET will equal to the cost of local supply.

(1)

In fact, the electricity price markup may be aﬀected by other factors such as power demand of the electricity input province. So if we focus on the single line, we will ﬁnd that the price markup may be not consistent with the diﬀerence of marginal electricity feed-in tariﬀ, which means there is large cross-subsidization between each transmission line. But for the whole grid, the total proﬁt is close to zero, and the total price markup can reﬂect the total LDET cost of the grid.

Assumption 2. The principle of electricity dispatching is minimizing the total transmission distance which is shown in Eq. (2). We will demonstrate in Section 2.3 that the minimal transmission distance problem is equivalent to the maximize proﬁt problem under certain condition. The subscripts i and j represent the electricity output and input province respectively. The symbol d ij represents the distance between i and j; t ij means the transmission volume between i and j. The optimization problem is under the constraints in Eq. (3). The symbol Oi  is the total output capacity of i, and the symbol I j represents the total input requirement of j.

It should be mentioned that the constraint of input/output volume is base on the real transmission data. In practice, the electricity exchange between diﬀerent districts may aﬀected by other factors such as policy and monopoly. The realistic electricity input and output of each province is a result of these impacts. The constraint of Eq. (3) could make that the data set we guiding from the optimal function reﬂect these inﬂuences.

As we can see in Fig. 2, the elements of transmission matrix may include every possible relation between the electricity exporter and importer.

2.2. The WLS regression

As we can see in Fig. 3, the cost of LDET can be divided into the cost of substations and the cost of transmission lines, which can be classiﬁed as variable cost and ﬁxed cost.

According to the current technical standard of the electricity transmission industry (State economic and trade commission, 2000; China southern power grid, 2008), both the variable cost and ﬁxed cost can be further divided in two departments and residual term. These technical documents are applied in the practical, and can reﬂect the real operation cost. We can use a linear model to regress their relationship which is shown in Eq. (4). The symbol β 0 represents the cost component that irrelevant to the distance of transmission. This part of cost contains the ﬁx cost of investment of substation, and the energy loss in transformer modulator and energy consumption in substation. The symbol β 1 represents the marginal cost of the distance, which is composed of the loss in line and the line investment.

The transmission volume between each province is diﬀerent, which means that the method of ordinary least squares couldn’t be applied directly due to the sample have no homoscedasticity. This paper uses the weighted least square (WLS) method to deal with this problem. The

Fig. 2. Sketch diagram of electricity transmission.

objective function of weighted least squares estimate is shown by Eq. (5).

The weight coeﬃcient is needed when estimating the parameters of WLS. The weight coeﬃcient is the share of transmission line t (Eq. (6)).

2.3. How to get the weight matrix

(6)

This section establishes an optimal path model according to the basic assumptions in Section 2.1. The equivalency between the optimal path problem and the proﬁt maximization problem is also proved. Due to the optimal path problem is hard to be solve under the tradition optimal method, an initial value setting method is also introduced in this section.

2.3.1. The optimal path model According to the Assumption 2, the grid will minimize the transmission distance of electricity. Under this assumption, we can calculate the transmission volume between each province by using the optimal equations which are described in Eqs. (2) and (3).

The matrix T in Eq. (7) represent the transmission relationship. The transmission matrix conclude n*m elements. The element t ij represents the electricity volume transmitted from i to j.

(7)

2.3.2. The equivalency In the next step, we will prove that under the certain electricity resource endowment, the optimal path problem is equivalent to the proﬁt maximization problem.

The proﬁt maximization problem can be described by Eq. (8). The item p j represents the electricity price of the input province, and pi  represents the price of output province. The proﬁt Π is equal to the total revenue minus the total cost in the process of electricity purchase and transmission.

(8)

Under the certain resource endowment, the total input volume and output volume of each province is constant. As presented by Eqs. (9) and (10), the total output volume of province j is O j , the total input volume of province i is I i .

Substitute the Eqs. (9) and (10) into the Eq. (8), we can rewrite the optimal problem as Eq. (11). Under the certain resource endowment, the total input volume and output volume of each province is reality value, which is setting as constant and applying as the constraint condition of the optimization problem. So the items of p j I i , p i O j and mnβ 0 are constant variable. Combining all the constant items as R , the optimization objective equation can be written as Eq. (12), which means that if the electricity endowment is constant, the optimal path problem and the proﬁt maximization problem are equivalent.

(12)

2.3.3. How to set the initial value Intuitively, the exporter and importer should not be far away in the optimal state. For example, Inner Mongolia's power is transmitted prior to Beijing, while Yunnan's power is transmitted prior to Guangdong. The transmission between Inner Mongolia and most parts of the southern province should be 0. Therefore, only few elements of the ﬁnal transmission matrix elements have a value， which means transmission matrix should be a sparse matrix.

The number of elements of the transmission matrix is 13*17 = 221. Combine with that it may be a sparse matrix and endowment constraint should be satisﬁed, it's very hard to get an optimal result.

Fig. 4. The ﬂow chat of initial value allocation.

Energy Policy 109 (2017) 132–140

The similar problems such as logistics distribution problem often adopt complex algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) (Nayeem et al., 2014). In this paper, we use a special initial value setting method to overcome the obstacles. The initial value matrix can be pre assigned to the transmission capacity according to the method of the nearest distribution. Under this scheme, the transmission matrix can satisfy the endowment constraint, and the distributed result is close to the optimal value, so that the optimal solution can be easily obtained.

As is shorn in Fig. 4, the method of assigning the initial value matrix can be list as follow,

Step 1. Starting from the ﬁrst electricity exporter (i=1). The amount of electricity awaiting assignment is equal to the output capacity of the exporter: Or i = O i .

Step 2. Searching the importer ‘k’ who is nearest to the exporter ‘i’ and the supply is not saturated. The demand gap is deﬁned as Dr k . Step 3-A. If Or i > Dr k , the supply surplus of ‘i’ is higher than the demand gap of ‘k’. At this time, the transmission volume between ‘i’ and ‘k’ is d ik = Dr k . The demand gap of ‘k’ is ﬁlled, so Dr k = 0 . The supply surplus should minus the transmission volume: Or i = Or i − d ik . Then repeat step 2.

Step 3-B. If Or i ≤ Dr k , the supply surplus of ‘i’ can’t meet the demand gap of ‘k’. At this condition, the transmission volume between ‘i’ and ‘k’ is equal to the supply surplus of ‘i’: d ik = Or i . The supply surplus should be Or i = 0 ; the demand gap of ‘k’ should be Dr k = Dr k − d ik . Step 4. Check whether the supply is balance. If all the exporter's supply surplus is 0, the calculation is ﬁnished. Otherwise, distribute the next exporter (i = i + 1), and repeat step1 to step 3.

2.4. The other impact factors Beside the distance between exporter and importer, some other factors may impact the price mark-up. For example, the high proportion of external electricity represent the local supply is insuﬃcient, so there may have greater price mark-up. In addition, the peak-valley price mode may aﬀect the eﬃciency of grid and further impact the electricity price. Due to the relationship between these two variables and the price mark-up may not be linear, and we are only interested in whether the factors have impacts on price mark-up. So this paper adds two dummy variables to examine these factors. The top 50% of the variable value are assigned to be 1, and the remaining valuables are assigned to be 0.

2.5. Data sources and processing methods

2.5.1. The electrical balance data The electricity balance data come from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2015). Due to Taiwan and Tibet are not connecting to the national grid, we eliminate these two provinces. There exists minor deviation between the sum of each province and the national data. We adjust the data of each province according to aggregate balance. Finally, there are 13 electricity exporters and 17 electricity importers.

2.5.2. Electricity price and marginal cost The supply side of electricity is consisting of many kinds of generators such as coal, hydropower, nuclear, solar PV, etc. In general, all the nuclear power is absorbed by the grid, and the proportion of wind and PV is tiny. In China, the power grid often uses the coal electricity and hydropower as peaking power. So in this paper, we choose the weighted average feed-in tariﬀ of thermal power and hydropower as the marginal cost. The price data source from National Energy Administration (2015).

2.5.3. The distance between each province For the distance of each province, we use the spatial econometrics software Geoda to calculate the centroids of each province and use the ‘haversine’ formula to calculate the great-circle distance between two points, which is the shortest distance over the earth's surface (Van Brummelen, 2013).

2.5.4. The standard deviation of price ﬂuctuation In China, the T & D network and retail process of electricity are monopolized by two giant institutions: State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid. The retail price is regulated by the government. The price mechanisms come from the Price Bureau's stipulation in each province. We use the electricity price of general industrial and commercial to calculate the standard deviation of intraday electricity price. In some provinces, there have no peak/valley price mechanism. For these provinces the standard deviation of intraday electricity price is zero.

The data are summarized in Table 1.

3. Result

Base on the model described in Section 2, the transmission volume under optimal path can be calculated. Results are listed in Table 2. The weighting matrix can be calculated according to the transmission volume of each path.

We run four regression models to examine the marginal eﬀects of diﬀerent factors that may impact the transmission cost. The result is shown in Table 3. Model 1 analyzes the variables of Distance. The regression coeﬃcient of intercept can be considered as the cost composition that is uncorrelated to the distance of transmission. The regression coeﬃcient of distance can be considered as the marginal cost of transmission distance. Model 2 considers the impact of ‘proportion of import’, and Model 3 considers the factors of ‘standard

value of peak-valley price’. Model 4 contains all the variables.

4. Discussion

4.1. The optimal transmission path

As is shown in Fig. 5, the major transmission direction is from western to eastern. This result is consistent with the national policy ""west to east electricity transmission"". Although “Xinjiang” and “Gansu” are rich in power resources, but the delivery is almost no transmission to the eastern.

Through Fig. 5, we can have a general cognition about how the electricity supply is balanced between diﬀerent regions. The import electricity of “Bohai sea surrounding economic circle” (including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Liaoning) is major source from Inner Mongolia and Shanxi. The import electricity of “Yangtze river delta economic area” (including Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang) is major supplied by “Shaanxi”, “Hubei” and “Anhui”. And the electricity import of “Pearl river delta economic area” major comes from “Yunnan” and “Guizhou”.

In China's electricity market, Tibet grid is tiny and independent from the main grid. The other areas are divided into two giant institutions: State Grid and Southern Power Grid. Fig. 5 marked the area of Southern Power Grid in the dashed line. The arrowed line represents the transmission direction and the range in the legend represents the transmission volume. The number in the parenthesis means the quantity of transmission line during the corresponding range. From the ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd that the net transmission volume between the State Grid and Southern Power Grid is tiny. This result could provide evidence about the ineﬃcient of China's electricity transmission allocation. The transmission path could be further optimized because some power output province in the area of Southern Power Grid is close to the power input province in the district of State Grid. But in reality, the allocation of transmission line is impact by other factors such as politic and monopoly. 

4.2. WLS regression result 

The result of model 1 can be used to estimate the cost of new transmission line, and further provide recommendations for future electricity generator allocation.

We consider the impact of import electricity proportion in Model 2. The result shows that the proportion of import electricity aﬀects the price mark-up signiﬁcantly, which means that the price policy of grid is not neutral. The high external dependence of electricity may lead high price mark-up.

The impact of the intraday price ﬂuctuation is considered in Model 3. Price standard variation intraday is used as a dummy to evaluate the eﬀects. The result reveals that the higher the price mark-up is, the more ﬂexible price policy will be implemented. The reason may be that the high price mark-up may provide motivation for the local government (the price policy is setting by government) to improve the eﬃciency of power grid. The high peak-valley price diﬀerence can be use a tool to smooth the demand intraday and improve the grid eﬃciency.

The joint inﬂuence of the entire variable above is tested in Model 4.

The F-statistic of each model is signiﬁcant. The value of R-square in Model 2–4 is high, which indicates that the proportion of the variance in the transmission cost is predictable from the explanatory variables.

4.3. Application case: the evaluation of renewable energy policy

The LDET model evaluates the cost from output to input. Here two cases about renewable policy are discussed to show how the LDET model can be applied.

In order to transform into the low-carbon and green development path, China's government launched a series of policy to encourage the development of renewable energy (He et al., 2016). Massive subsidies are investment in the renewable industry (Zhang et al., 2016), leading to a boom in the relevant ﬁelds. Fig. 6 shows the accumulate capacity of wind and photovoltaic. The renewable energy generator is growing very fast in recent year.

Similar as the fossil fuel, the resources endowment of renewable energy is concentrating in western regions of China. The current renewable energy policies pricing a higher feed-in tariﬀ for the centralized generator, which provide strong incentive for the enterprise to install the centralization capacity in western districts. But the electricity generated by the renewable sources must be transmitted from western to eastern. Correspondingly, the power grid will suﬀer a high transmission cost. The cost of grid is always ignored in the design of previous policy, which makes the grid refuse to absorb the renewable electricity. In 2014, the abandoning rate of wind power in major province reached 10.9–31.2% (China National Renewable Energy Centre, 2015) due to the unreasonable mechanism. The LDET cost can be seem as the external cost for the renewable enterprise, which should be internalized when design the renewable support policy. Case 1. The abandon of wind and photovoltaic in Jiuquan district The ﬁrst case focuses on the phenomenon of wind power abandon in Jiuquan, Gansu. In recently years, hundreds of billions investment have been spent on the wind generator in Jiuquan district. Due to the power grid have no ability (or willing) to absorb the electricity, nearly 40% of the wind electricity is abandoned.

The LDET cost model can help us calculate the transmission cost from diﬀerent importers and exporters. The results are list in Table 4. This cost is close to the data estimated by Lin and Li (2015), which is $0.015–0.025/kW h. Mills et al. (2012) calculate the transmission cost of wind in United States, and ﬁnd that most of the unit cost of transmission for wind is below $0.025/kW h. Through Table 4, we can ﬁnd that the transmission cost from Jiuquan to the three major demand centers is obviously higher than the reference exporter. The cost diﬀerence is up to 70–92 CNY/MW h. If all the wind electricity is absorbed, the grid will suﬀer high cost, and these cost may ﬁnally suﬀered by the consumers through a higher retail electricity price.

This case reveals that the government should not only consider the cost of direct subsidy when formulating the policy of renewable energy development. The cost of power grid should also be considered as a social cost. For renewable energy enterprises, the LDET cost is external costs, which have no inﬂuence in their investment decisions. But the tLDET costs eventually need someone to bear. When the external costs beyond the bearing ability of grids, refusing the renewable energy to be tied-in the power grid has become an inevitable choice. Current renewable energy policy of China has caused a distortion of generator allocation.

Case 2. The subsidies policy of centralized and distributed photovoltaic

The second case focuses on the validity of diﬀerent photovoltaic subsidies policy. The photovoltaic have two forms: centralized and distributed. The centralized photovoltaic stations are always built in the sun-intense areas and have higher eﬃciency in producing electricity. The distributed photovoltaic is allocated in the demand sides. Although distributed photovoltaic has a lower eﬃcient of producing electricity, the transmission cost is lower than centralized. The past policy provides a higher feed-in tariﬀ for the centralized photovoltaic, led to the capacity of centralized photovoltaic generator is growing faster than the distributed accordingly.

To evaluate the eﬃcient of current price subsidy policy, we need to compare the embedded cost including the cost of LDET. Table 5 list the cost comparison between centralized and distributed photovoltaic. The feed-in tariﬀ is made by the national development and reform commission of China. The transmission cost is estimated by the LDET model we propose in this paper. The distribution and sale cost is calculate by the retail price and the feed-in price of the import province, which source from China Electricity Council (2015). The total cost contains all the items together. The last column of cost deviation reﬂects the total cost between the centralized photovoltaic and distributed photovoltaic. Considering the transmission cost, the comprehensive cost of centralized is higher than the distribution photovoltaic. The deviation can reach 0.326–0.505 CNY/kW h.

Due to the current policy provide misplaced incentive for the centralized renewable energy, more than 15% of wind and photovoltaic energy are abandoned in 2015 (Li et al., 2017). One of the important methods to improve the absorption of renewable energy and lifting the eﬃciency of LDET is applying the energy storage technology. The marginal cost of abandoned photovoltaic can be considered as zero. But consider the break even of energy storage in China is still as high as 1 CNY/kW h (Lin and Wu, 2017), which is higher than the feed-in tariﬀ of photovoltaic. The application of energy is still uneconomical under current situation. Meanwhile, the LDET cost is lower than the feed-in tariﬀ of photovoltaic, and even lower than the cost of distributed photovoltaic. This implies that the regulators could apply the policies such as decreasing the feed-in tariﬀ, applying tiered pricing mechanism or providing subsidies for the LDET if they want to increase the absorptive rate of renewable energy.

5. Conclusions and policy implications

The distribution of China's energy resource endowment is uneven, which causes a requirement of large scale long-distance transmission. Meanwhile, the electricity demand of China grows very fast. Understanding the LDET cost of China has important practical signiﬁcance. However, few studies have focused on this topic due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new framework to estimate the LDET cost. Based on the hypothesis that the deviation of marginal cost between diﬀerent districts is equivalent to the LDET cost, we can calculate the transmission cost from the price mark-up. Meanwhile, according to the assumption of proﬁt maximization, an optimal model is established to calculate the transmission volume between diﬀerent provinces. Base on those assumption, a transmission data set could be acquired, then the WLS method is applied to estimate the coeﬃcient of the factors that may impact real cost of long distance transmission.

Since the power grid is a very complex system, accurate analysis for each circuit line will greatly complicate the problem and may not be necessary for some application. The result of this paper reﬂects the ﬁnal cost from supply side to demand side. Although lots of micro details are ignored, it is still helpful for the macro level analysis. For example, when evaluating the synthesize cost of distributed renewable energy and centralized renewable energy, we do not need to analyze the state of the whole power network, and only need to know the cost of addition capacity. The results of this paper can provide a simple and eﬃcient tool for similar analysis.

Based on the LDET cost model, this paper evaluates China's renewable energy development policy. Two case studies were presented. The ﬁrst case discusses long-distance wind power costs, and draws a conclusion that the external cost of grid may be the main reason of the low wind power absorptive rate. The second case compares the centralized and distributed PV subsidy policies, and proves that the current renewable energy policy of China is ineﬀective.

The result of this study can help the government to allocate the power generator more reasonably, and enhance the eﬃcient when formulate the support policy of renewable energy. The main policy recommendations of this paper are as follows:

When planning the layout of the electricity generator, not only the resources endowment but also the transmission and distribution cost of grid should be taken into account. Especially for inter-provincial electricity distribution, the actual cost of LDET should be internalized during the planning phase of the electricity project.

The current subsidy mechanism for photovoltaic is ineﬃcient and need to be reformed. Though the resource in the western region is

abundant, the total cost of centralized photovoltaic is higher than the distributed photovoltaic. The preferential policy should give priority to the distributed photovoltaic. Meanwhile, the regulator should make a more ﬂexible feed-in tariﬀ such as grade pricing, to enhance the absorb ratio of renewable power.

The renewable energy of central and western region should be encouraged to consume nearby, rather than being transmitted to the eastern demand centers cross long-distance. These districts should develop a more ﬂexible peak-valley pricing policy to enhance the utilization eﬃciency of power grid. Meanwhile, electricity import provinces in the eastern region should encourage the development of energy storage (such as pumped storage, battery energy storage) to transfer the peak load and increase the load rate of transmission line.

9,Demand side management in China: The context of China’s power industry reform,"The reform of China’s power industry has lasted for decades, while the implementation of demand side management (DSM) in China is still in its infancy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the DSM and Demand Response (DR) programs in China under the context of China’s power industry reform. We first present a brief introduction of the background, including the socio economic status and geographical location of China, the energy policy of China, China’s power industry, the smart grids and microgrid in China, and the reform of China’s power industry. Then, based on the introduction of DSM and the analysis of DSM practices in some countries, we discuss the development status of DSM and the reform of electricity pricing in China. Finally, the main challenges in five aspects for the future development of DSM programs in China are proposed and discussed. These challenges include customer understanding and participation, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and information and communication technology (ICT), pricing mechanisms and optimal scheduling, big data analytics based decision support, as well as government regulations and market policies.","1. Introduction

The large-scale population and fast-growing economy of China have resulted in the increasing demand of electricity. With the rapidly growing demand levels and lagging capacity investment, electricity demand–supply mismatch and the resulting problems are becoming more and more prominent in China [1–3]. An unbalanced power grid can result in severe power outages as in California, Chile, and Brasilia [4–7]. In addition, the increasingly serious air pollution problems in China also present an urgent requirement for the reform of China’s power industry [8].

Though many reform measures for China’s power industry have been taken in the past decades, many problems still exist [9–11]. These problems include high energy consumption and high emissions, low productivity, and electricity supply shortage. With the penetration of renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and the advances in information and communication technology (ICT), China has been gradually realizing the importance of consumer behaviors on energy consumption. That is, alleviating the various problems of power industry by taking measures on demand side to change consumers’ electricity consumption behaviors. These kinds of measures are called demand side management (DSM), demand response (DR) or load management (LM) programs [12–14]. In smart grid environment, DSM also plays a crucial role in the self-healing processes of smart grid [15].

In a broader sense, there have been some DSM measures that been implemented in China, especially those for large and medium industrial enterprises. Most of the DSM programs are governmentmandated load management programs. Such as in seasonal or daily peak periods, load shedding is required by government so that residential and commercial electricity demand can be met. However, the effect of this simple DSM measure is limited. The form of this DSM measure is simple and not optimal. The inappropriate power cuts can signiﬁcantly reduce the production efﬁciency of industrial enterprises. Also, the load management potential on user side is fully not realized. In addition to large consumers, it has been demonstrated that residential demand response also contributed signiﬁcantly to energy reduction [16,17]. The reform of China’s power industry has lasted for decades, while the implementation of DSM in China are still in the initial stage, especially the DSM programs for residential consumers [18]. Many DSM related policies were formulated and promulgated just in recent years, such as the Demand Side Management Measures enacted in November 2010 [19], the multistep residential pricing policy in October 2010 [20], and the time-of-use (TOU) pricing policy in December 2013 [21].

Currently, research efforts on the DSM, DR or LM of China’s power industry are still limited. Yu [22] redesigned the “system beneﬁt charge (SBC)” policy to facilitate the ﬁnancial support of DSM in China, and discussed three kinds of price discrimination related to the development of DSM programs in China [23]. He et al. [24] adopted a Monte Carlo simulation approach to quantify residential demand responsiveness to TOU rates, and presented a case study of a city in China. Wang et al. [25] presented a review of DR programs in China in 2010. They mainly discussed the DR programs in three provinces of China, namely Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong, mainly using the data in 2003 and before. However, there has been considerable development of DSM in China in recent years. Their study did not cover the latest progresses. To ﬁll this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the DSM in China under the context of

China’s power industry reform. We also point out the major challenges facing the future development of DSM programs in China.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The socio economic status and geographical location of China, the energy policy of China, China’s power industry, the smart grids and microgrid in China, and the reform of China’s power industry are presented in Section 2 as research background. Then, Section 3 discusses the concept of DSM and the practices of DSM in some countries. Section 4 provides the development status of DSM and the reform of electricity pricing in China. Afterwards, Section 5 proposes and discusses the major challenges of the future research and development of DSM in China. Finally, conclusions are made in Section 6.

2. Background

2.1. Socio economic status and geographical location of China

People’s Republic of China (PR China) was founded in October 1, 1949. It is located in the eastern part of the Asian continent and the Paciﬁc West Coast. The land area of China is about 9.6 million square kilometers, and the sea area is about 4.73 million square kilometers. China’s land border is up to 22,800 km, with a coastline of about 18,000 km [26].

China, with the world’s largest population, is still a developing country in the world. The sixth national population census of China in November 2010 showed that the total population of China was 1370,536,875 [26]. Family planning is a basic national policy of China. China’s provincial administrative divisions include 4 municipalities, 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 2 special administrative regions. The capital of China is Beijing [27].

After the founding of PR China, through a planned large-scale economic development, China has become one of the world’s economic powers with development potential. From 1953 to 2010, China has successively completed eleven “Five-Year Plan”, which laid solid foundations for the development of national economy. The twelfth “Five-Year Plan” (2011–2015) is now being implemented. The reform and opening in China since 1979 has led to an unprecedented rapid growth of Chinese economy. Currently, China has become the world’s second largest economy. Socialist market economic system has been initially established in China, and the basic role of market in resource allocation has been signiﬁcantly enhanced [28]. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNP) of China in 2012 were 51.6 trillion Yuan and 51.9 trillion Yuan, respectively [29].

2.2. Energy policy of China

Due to the large population and the rapid economic development, China has a very large amount of energy consumption. Many problems have occurred in the process of energy consumption in China, such as the low energy efﬁciency and high emissions.

In the October 24, 2012, the State Council Information Ofﬁce of the People’s Republic of China released a white paper about China’s energy policy, namely the China’s Energy Policy [30]. The full text of the white paper has about 14,000 words. It mainly includes nine parts, namely status of energy development, energy development policies and objectives, comprehensively promoting energy conservation, development of new energy and renewable energy, promoting the clean development of fossil energy, improving the universal service level of energy, accelerating the advancement of energy technologies, deepening energy reform, and strengthening international cooperation in energy ﬁeld.

The basic contents of China’s energy policy are as follows [30]. The principles of energy development in China include “conservation priority, relying on domestic, diversiﬁed development, environmental protection, technological innovation, deepening reform, international cooperation, and improving people’s livelihood”. Promote the pattern transformation of energy production and consumption. Build a modern energy industry system, which is safe, stable, economical and clean. Make efforts to support the sustainable development of economy and society by the sustainable development of energy.

The main objectives of China’s energy policy are that the proportion of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption reaches about 15% by 2020, and the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP decreases by 40–50% compared with 2005 [30].

2.3. China’s power industry

With the rapid economic growth, China has also seen an dramatic increase in power generation and consumption in the past decades [2]. The total power generation capacity and electricity consumption in China in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.

Figs. 1 and 2 show that both power generation capacity and electricity consumption in China have grown rapidly in the past twenty years. In 2012, China’s total power generation capacity and consumption have reached 49,875.5 GWh and 49,762.6 GWh, respectively [32]. As for the power generation methods, renewable energy power generations, such as wind power and solar power, still accounted for small proportions in the total power generation capacity of China. Thermal power is still the major way of power generation in China, which has led to low energy efﬁciency and serious pollution emissions [33,34].

Due to the unbalanced economic development and population distribution in China, the electricity consumption in different areas of China varies greatly. In 2011, the electricity consumption in different areas of China is presented in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 indicates that provinces in East China, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi and Shandong, accounted for the largest proportion of electricity consumption in China. This is mainly due to the fact that East China is the most economically developed regions in China, with the highest population density. In contrast, though Northwest China has the largest land area, the electricity consumption in this area is minimal. This is mainly due to the low level of economic development and sparse population in this area.

In addition to regional differences, the electricity consumption and its growth rate of different provinces in China also have great difference. The electricity consumptions of different provinces in China from 2009 to 2012 are given in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 shows that the more economically developed and relatively large provinces, such as Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong, have greater electricity consumption and higher growth rate.

Facing the increasing electricity demand, China has taken some measures on load management [10]. Most of the traditional load management programs are on the supply side, such as the economic load dispatch or load scheduling [35–37] based on load forecasting [38,39]. Also, many DSM programs are designed for large industrial or commercial customers with greater load demand and larger potential for load curtailment. However, it has been identiﬁed that a large proportion of household load demand is interruptible without lowering the customer’s comfort [40]. This category of load is conventionally neglected in the implementation of DSM programs in China, due to the technical, economic, policy and behavioral barriers.

In order to achieve the objective that the operation and management of power systems become safer, more reliable, more environmentally friendly, more ﬂexible, more controllable, and more cost-effective, the concept of “smart grid” was proposed [41–43]. Smart grid is generally recognized as an intelligent power grid system which integrates the energy ﬂow and information ﬂow by advanced information technology, sensor technology, automatic control technology and scientiﬁc management methods, etc. Microgrid is an important part of smart grid implementation and application. Many different distributed generators and energy storage devices can assess to the main power grid in the smart grid environment. They can form a “virtual power plant” through the interconnection on all voltage levels by electrical communication systems [44–46].

With technology advances and increasing investments, there has been a signiﬁcant development of China’s smart grid in recent years. The large-scale construction of a smart grid is the main content of China’s power industry in its 12th “Five-Year Plan”. This period is the overall construction phase of China’s smart grid. The investments of smart grid construction in China will reach approximately 2 trillion Yuan during the 12th Five-Year period. The 13th Five-Year period (2016–2020) is the basically completed phrase of China’s smart grid. The smart grid investments during this period will be 1.7 trillion Yuan [47]. During the 12th Five-Year period (2011–2015), the key tasks of the development of China’s smart grid are in nine aspects. These include large-scale intermittent new energy grid connection techniques, power system technologies supporting the development of electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage systems, intelligent power distribution and consumption technology, intelligent operation and control of large power grid, intelligent power transmission technology and equipment, grid information and communication technology, ﬂexible power transmission technology and equipment, and integrated comprehensive demonstration of smart grid. The microgrid was gradually emerging in China since 2004. Though some demonstration projects have been completed and implemented in China, China’s microgrid is still in its infancy [48]. Currently, China is vigorously promoting renewable energy, which is an important part of China’s microgrid. The optimization allocation of power resources, the development of distributed power generation and distributed energy storage, as well as the optimal load distribution are combined to form the smart microgrid of China.

There have been a lot of research efforts that focus on the smart grid and microgrid of China. Fadaeenejad et al. [49] studied the present and future of smart grid in China and some other developing countries. Xiao [50] presented the conception of China’s smart grid construction, and proposed ﬁve potential research directions. The research directions include strong physical grid, smart grid equipment, information exchange platform, power grid coordination, and power supply interaction. Chang et al. [51] reviewed the basic characteristic and technical progress of China’s smart grid, and provided some suggestions to overcome the current problems. Ding and Qi [52] discussed the laws and regulations, technology and security, economy and market related issues of China’s smart grid construction. Zheng and Ai [48] discussed the development of microgrid in some developed countries, and the signiﬁcance of microgrid for the development of China’s future power grid. Shi et al. [53] proposed the characteristics and development directions of microgrid in China. They speciﬁcally discussed the operation mode, voltage level, capacity and the main types of microgrid in

China. Wu et al. [54] discussed the microgrid experimental systems dominated by research institutes and the microgrid demonstration projects dominated by enterprises in China.

2.5. Reform of China’s power industry

For a long time, the power sector in China has accumulated a lot of problems. These problems include the high energy consumption and high emissions [55,56], supply shortages in daily and seasonal peak periods [57,58], the unseasonable pricing mechanism [11,59], and the high cost and low efﬁciency of power generation, transmission and distribution [3,60].

From 1949 to 1978, the power industry of China was absolutely monopolized by the central government, and the government and power enterprises were joined together. The reform of China’s electricity sector has started from 1978 [18]. So far, the reform of China’s power industry can be divided into three stages, as shown in Fig. 5.

From 1978 to 1985, the reform of China’s electric power industry mainly aimed at solving the severe shortage of electricity supply through fund-raising. During this period, there was severe shortage of funds for the construction of power industry, thus the electricity supply was unable to meet the needs of national economic development. Therefore, many different ways of fund-raising, including bank loans, joint production and attracting foreign investments, were proposed to solve the problem of shortage of funds. In 1985, marketoriented pricing mechanism of electricity was also proposed.

The main task of the second stage reform, from 1985 to 2002, of China’s power industry was to separate the responsibilities of government and power companies. In 1993, the Power Associates was reorganized into the Electric Power Group Corporation. At the same time, ﬁve major power groups were established. Then, the State Power Corporation, a large state-owned company established according to the modern enterprise system, was formed in 1996. In 1998, the Chinese central government decided to revoke the Ministry of Power Industry.

In 2002, the comprehensive reform plan of China’s electric power industry entitled Scheme of the Reform for Power Industry [61] was enacted, which indicates the beginning of the third stage reform of China’s power industry. Also, a series of electricity pricing reform schemes have been proposed from 2003. The objectives of the reforms in this stage were to “break monopoly and introduce competition, improve efﬁciency and reduce costs, improve the pricing mechanism, optimize power resources allocation, and promote a national network”. Such that a fair, open, competitive, orderly and healthy electricity market system can be formed. According to the this reform scheme, the State Power Corporation was split into two grid companies, ﬁve power generation companies and four auxiliary service companies. In 2009, the auxiliary services separated from two grid companies and the four auxiliary service companies were restructured as Power Construction Corporation of China (Power China) and China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (Energy China). This indicated the system reform of China’s power industry entered a new stage. The structure of China’s State Power is shown in Fig. 6.

3. Demand side management (DSM) programs

3.1. Introduction of DSM

Traditionally, people deal with the various power grid problems mainly in the supply side, by installing new generation capacity. However, the costs of infrastructure investment in expanding generation capacity increased greatly. Moreover, people are increasingly aware that not all the challenges facing the power grid can be addressed effectively and efﬁciently in the supply side. Demand-side measures can play more important roles in achieving power supply and demand balance, enhancing power grid reliability, and improving energy efﬁciency.

DSM is a relatively broader concept, which includes the many actions from the replacement of energy-efﬁcient appliances, to the reduction of energy consumption and the shifting of time when electricity is used, to the implementation of complex dynamic pricing mechanisms. Thus, customers’ electricity using behaviors can be changed. These changes in the time pattern and magnitude of the network load lead to the desired changes in their load shapes. The six major types of DSM objectives and tasks are peak clipping, valley ﬁlling, load shifting, strategic conservation, strategic load growth, and ﬂexible load shape [62–64]. The six broad ways of altering the load shapes in DSM are illustrated in Fig. 7. Similarly, LM means actions taken on both supply and demand side, including the construction of power generation facilities and the deployment of energy storage equipment in supply side, as well as the actions affecting consumers’ electricity consumption patterns in demand side [65]. Ref. [66] pointed that DSM can be categorized into four types programs, namely energy efﬁciency (EE), TOU, demand response (DR), and spinning reserve (SR). So DR programs can be seen as a subset of DSM [67]. Most of the actions in DR use ﬁnancial signals as main incentives to change consumers’ electricity consumption patterns, as shown in Fig. 8.

From the perspective of economics, the price elasticity of demand is a critical indicator in measuring DR programs [68–70]. The price elasticity of demand is the ratio of percentage change in electricity demand to the percentage change in electricity price, which is deﬁned as where EP is the price elasticity, %ΔQ is the percentage change of electricity demand as a result of %ΔP price change.

The elasticity of substitution is another important indicator, which is deﬁned as

The elasticity of substitution EP subs is the negative of percentage change in the ratio of peak to off-peak demand, %ΔðQ P =Q O Þ, divided by the percentage change in the ratio of peak to off-peak price, %ΔðP P =P O Þ [71]. EP measures the load reduction while EPsubs  measures the load shifting, and these two indicators are interchangeable.

The most popular deﬁnition of DR is given by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [72] and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) [73] as “Changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized.” So DR programs can also be classiﬁed into two groups: price-based DR programs and incentive-based DR programs [13,74]. These two categories of DR are interconnected and the various programs under each category can be designed to achieve complementary goals. Price-based DR programs, also called non-dispatchable DR resource, are triggered by dynamic price rates. The DR programs in this group aim to change the energy consumption patterns of consumers by different electricity pricing mechanisms [75]. Pricebased DR is entirely voluntary and non-dispatchable because it cannot be exactly determined whether and when customers will response to the prices, and the amount that consumers will change is also unpredictable. This type of DR programs is more ﬂexible, and the success of such programs mainly relies on the awareness, attitude and behavioral adaption of consumers [76]. In contrast, incentive-based DR is disaptchable DR resource, which is driven by incentive payments. DR programs in this group mean the planned changes in electricity consumption that customers have agreed to response to requests from the operators [77–79]. These programs give participating customers incentive payments and can consider penalties for customers that enroll but do not respond. Based on

these programs, load shedding can be achieved in either automated or voluntary ways. The classiﬁcation of the two types of DR programs is shown in Fig. 9.

Price-based DR programs include time-of-use (TOU) pricing, realtime pricing (RTP), critical peak pricing (CPP), peak-time rebate (PTR) pricing and inclining block rate (IBR) [71]. TOU applies a static price schedule, and it is simple and easy to implementation. The RTP tariffs vary continuously according to the wholesale price or regional demand. The difference between CPP and TOU is that the changes of times and prices in CPP tariff are not ﬁxed. PTR pricing is similar to CPP except that users will receive rebate payments if they reduce electricity consumption during peak times. IBR structures focus on conservation, and they charge a higher rate for each incremental block of electricity consumption. Though structures are different, the various pricing schemes promote the economic efﬁciency of the power systems and the achievement of DSM objectives.

By contrast, incentive-based DR programs mainly include direct load control (DLC), interruptible/curtailable service, demand bidding/buyback program, and emergency DR programs [66]. In DLC, utility or grid operator gets free access to customer processes. While users can get speciﬁc contract with limited sheds in interruptible/ curtailable services. In demand bidding/buyback program, customers can bid for load shedding at attractive prices. Emergency DR programs mean that customers response to emergency signals voluntarily. The speciﬁc deﬁnition and introduction of more DR program can be found in Refs. [72,80–84].

Generally, there is no clear distinction among the concepts of DSM, LM and DR. These terms overlap and their meaning depends on the point of view [14]. They all refer to the various actions which can change the electricity consumption behaviors of consumers. Such that the load curves of consumers can be reshaped and the daily and seasonal load peaks can be smoothed, the electricity supply-demand balance can be better achieved, and the reliability of the power grid can be enhanced. Speciﬁcally, traditional DSM and LM have longer history in power system development, which have broader meanings. While in current electricity markets, modern DR programs are attracting more and more attention than traditional DSM and LM programs [85].

3.2. DSM experiences in some countries

Market-based electricity industry reform has become a global trend since 1980s. In many developed countries, such as the US, the UK and many other European countries, competitive electricity markets have been formed as a consequence of power system deregulation and power sector restructuring. Therefore, many DSM programs has been successfully implemented in these countries [86]. Though the power sector in China is still a monopoly which is mainly regulated by government, it is also carrying out the reform of the power sector [9]. Hence, many successful experiences of other countries in implementing DSM programs can be drawn by China.

In this section, we present a brief overview of the DSM, DR or LM programs implemented in some developed countries, including the US, UK, Germany, and some other European countries (Table 1).

Cappers et al. [87] presented an overview of the DR resources in US electric power markets. Supported by the FERC policies, the development of wholesale markets in the United States has promoted wider participation of DR services providers. These new curtailment programs will also facilitate the expansion of the DR industry and the innovation of DR services in the US.

Bradley et al. [90] studied the value of costs and beneﬁts from DR programs implemented in the UK, and their review showed that the economic case for DR in UK electricity markets is positive. Warren [91] analyzed the DSM policies in the UK. He discussed the Electricity Market Reform proposals in the UK and the inﬂuence of EU Directives on its DSM policies. Also, he emphasized the important roles of regulatory support and utility ﬁnancial incentives for the success of DSM policies in the UK.

Paulus and Borggrefe [94] investigated the technical and economic potential of DSM programs in Germany’s energy-incentive industries by 2030. Their scenario results showed that DSM in large industries could provide nearly 50% of capacity reserves for the positive tertiary balancing market in 2020. Klobasa [96] pointed out that the reserve capacity provided by DR in Germany together with improved wind power predictions can reduce the additional balancing costs to below 2 euro/MWh in 2020. Koliou et al. [95] proposed the three mechanism design aspects that undermined the DR in German balancing mechanism, namely minimum bidding volume, minimum bid duration and binding up and down bids.

Sæle and Grande [16] studied the DR potentials from household customers in Norway. Their research demonstrated that the DR to price will not affect the price, but the imbalances caused may lead to additional costs. Italy has the highest penetration of smart meters and the highest retail prices in the Europe. Italy has recently introduced a new mechanism of energy pricing, aiming at shifting consumption to lower and cheaper loads periods [100]. Wind power has been recognized as an important driver for DR programs in Spain. System-led and price-led programs are two major categories of DR programs in Spain [100].

4. Development of DSM in China

4.1. Development status of DSM in China

To improve energy efﬁciency, promote optimal allocation of power resources, and ensure orderly electricity consumption, the

Demand Side Management Measures [19] was enacted in China in November 2010, and it was implemented since January 2011. There had been some DSM programs been implemented since the early 1990s, such as load shedding and energy storage for large industrial companies, and the promotion of energy efﬁcient appliances for residential consumers. But the Demand Side Management Measures is the ﬁrst systematic and comprehensive ofﬁcial policy on regulating the implementation of DSM programs in China.

According to Demand Side Management Measures, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is responsible for the national DSM work. Power grid companies are the important entities for implementing DSM. Electricity consumers are the direct participants of DSM programs in China. This policy is an overall national level regulation, each province also need to develop the corresponding speciﬁc DSM measures and schemes. The electricity and power saved by DSM programs should be regarded as a resource for the electric power industry development plan, energy development plan and regional economic development plan. The TOU pricing should be further improved, and energy storage in off-peak hours, seasonal pricing, high reliability pricing, interruptible load pricing and other electricity pricing mechanisms are encouraged. Power grid companies need to enhance the collection and analysis of load data, which provides information support for the implementation of DSM programs. Energy efﬁcient equipment is encouraged to be adopted in the whole process of power generation, transmission, distribution and consumption. In addition, the supervision, evaluation, advocacy and training, and funds related issues are also provided. The importance of load management information systems and related technologies are also emphasized. In 2014, the National Demand Side Management Platform (http:// www.chinadsm.gov.cn) has been established by NDRC [103].

4.2. Reform of electricity pricing in China

The pricing mechanism is an important strategy for the achievement of successful DSM programs, especially in the initial phase of implementing DSM programs [83]. In the process of China’s electric power industry reform, electricity pricing reform is one of the most important and difﬁcult part. In the third stage of China’s power industry reform since 2002, many policies and regulations on electricity pricing reform have been issued [104]. Table 2 summarizes the main reform measures of electricity pricing implemented in China since 2002.

The reform of electricity pricing mechanisms is always a key factor that affects the implementation of DSM programs in China. The reform of the electricity pricing in China has not stopped since 2002. The main contents and focuses of these electricity pricing reform measures, including the Electricity Pricing Reform Plan in 2003, the Electricity Regulatory Ordinance in 2005, and the Demand Side Management Measures in 2010, are not the same. Nevertheless, their ultimate goals are nearly similar. These objectives include lowering the costs of power generation, transmission and distribution, improving energy efﬁciency, reducing emissions, balancing power supply and demand by changing the behaviors of consumers, and enhancing the reliability of power grid.

The Guidance on the Implementation of Multistep Residential Electricity Pricing [20] published in October 2010. The multistep residential electricity pricing implemented since July 2012 is an important milestone in the development process of DSM programs in China. Here, we choose this Guidance as a typical policy of the DSM in China and discuss in detail. The two schemes of multistep residential electricity pricing in China are summarized in Table 3.

The Multistep Residential Electricity Pricing uses different electricity prices for users with different electricity consumption per month. For users with high electricity consumption per month, additional charges are required to pay for the excess parts. The multistep residential electricity pricing schemes are of great signiﬁcance in achieving equitable power consumption, energy conservation and emission reduction. They also provide guidance for the electricity consumption behaviors of residential consumers.

In December 2013, the NDRC issued a notice on the further improvement of residential multistep electricity pricing system [21]. The notice points out that “one household one meter” is the foundation for the implementation of multistep residential electricity

pricing mechanism, and the efforts of residential meter transformation should be further strengthened. By the end of 2017, more than 95% of transmission for households that share a meter should be completed. The power supply facilities in new residential areas should be built according to the “one household one meter” principle, and the multistep residential electricity pricing should be implemented in these new areas. Another important content of the notice is that it proposed the full implementation of TOU pricing policy for residential consumers. Under the premise that the overall level of residential electricity prices keep basically stable, residents are encouraged to participate in peak load shedding and shifting. For the areas that have not yet introduced TOU pricing, the TOU pricing policy should be formulated and promulgated before the end of 2015. For the areas that have introduced TOU pricing, the effect of policy implementation should be enhanced by improving the policy and intensifying the propaganda. Currently, based on this policy, many provinces in China have formulated and issued their own policies of TOU pricing.

5. Challenges for the development of DSM in China

The reform of China’s power industry has never stopped over the past few decades, and many efforts have been made in implementing DSM programs, especially in the reform of electricity pricing mechanisms. However, we note that the reform of China’s power industry is still on the way, and many DSM programs are still in their infancy. To solve the many accumulated contradictions and promote the efﬁcient, reliable and sustainable development of China’s power industry by fulﬁlling the potential of DSM, many challenges still need to be addressed.

5.1. Customer understanding and participation

People’s understanding of the DSM programs is usually not comprehensive and deep enough in the initial phase, especially in developing countries like China. Consumers’ behavioral changes in electricity consumption are the direct objective of DSM [105].

For example, the multistep residential electricity pricing policy was proposed for comments since October 2010 in China. While many people had resentment, and they believed that their electricity costs would rise. A web survey showed that about 89% of the respondents showed their concerns about this policy, and they thought it may increase their burden. Only about 8.3% of the respondents held positive attitudes toward this policy [106]. Also, though the policy on TOU pricing has been issued in China in 2013, the participation rates of TOU pricing program in many cities are very low. Such as, only about 10% of consumers participated in the TOU pricing program in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital of Hebei Province, after six months of pilot since July 2013 [107].

Residents’ insufﬁcient understanding or negative attitudes are major barriers for their participation and for the implementation of DSM in China. However, behavioral difference, caused by the level of understanding, surrounding environment, life style and cultural background, is one of the most complex factor in energy consumption [108–111]. Therefore, the DSM policies aimed at changing consumers’ energy consumption behavior should seriously consider their behavioral habits, life style, and cultural background. The DSM programs in China are still in their infancy. Therefore, the government and power grid companies should take more efforts to strengthen advocacy for consumers about the beneﬁts of DSM programs in improving energy efﬁciency, reducing costs, enhancing power grid reliability and reducing emissions, etc.

5.2. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and ICT

In the smart grid environment, the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and information and communication technology (ICT) are the important foundations [50,112]. The smart grid system mainly includes four parts, namely AMI, advanced distribution operation system, advanced transmission operation system and advanced asset management system [113]. AMI plays important roles in supporting the implementation of DR programs and promoting the interaction between power grid and users. The interaction between power grid and users is the main difference between smart grid and traditional power grid. The main functions of AMI include improving customer service, outage management, power stealing monitoring, remote connection, power quality management, remote upgrade of meter ﬁrmware, and supporting DR programs. The DR related smart grid technologies include smart

meter, two-way communication, consumer portal, home area network, meter data management (MDM), and enhanced customer service. The related costs and technical issues are major challenges for implementing DSM programs. The ICT side challenges include ICT interoperability, algorithm stability, information security, and information network management.

In China, the demand for smart meters is great. It is estimated that 790 million smart meters will be needed by 2020 [114]. Also, the costs of installing smart meters will be huge. Currently, smart meters are still limited in many areas of China. Traditional old-style meters are still widely exists, particularly in poor regions or rural areas.

Hence, the costs of the transformation, installation and deployment of smart meters, as well as the ICT infrastructure are major challenges for the implementation of DSM programs in China.

5.3. Pricing mechanisms and optimal scheduling

There are many electricity pricing and load scheduling problems in implementing DSM or DR programs. These problems have long been the hot and difﬁcult research topics in power system [44,115–117].

Currently, there have been various price-based DR programs. However, determining an appropriate pricing program and designing a good pricing mechanism so that the objectives of DSM can be better achieved are important research questions and practical challenges [117,118]. In the reform process of China’s power industry, the reform of electricity pricing system has long been the main content. Currently, the structure of electricity pricing in China is still simple and inefﬁcient. The reform of electricity pricing will be a long-term challenge for the implementation of DSM programs in China. So this requires the combined efforts of all the research community, power grid companies, and the government.

Traditionally, scheduling problem mainly occurs in the power supply side, which is called economic load dispatch or optimal load distribution [44,119–121]. Generally, this kind of scheduling is an optimization problem that minizing the total costs while meeting a variety of constraints by scheduling the generation capacities of different units. However, the scheduling on demand side that optimizing electricity consumption behaviors is more complex [122,123]. In the demand side scheduling, electricity costs, changes of electricity prices, comfort level of consumers, time factor, and weather conditions should all be considered. The scheduling on demand side is also one of the key challenges of future energy management systems. To promote the successful implementation of DSM and long-term development of China’s power industry, the optimal scheduling on demand side is an important research question.

5.4. Big data analytics based decision support

From the perspective of information technology, smart grid is a form of Internet of Things (IoTs) [124–126]. In IoTs, various sensors and Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) are used to collect data. The knowledge discovered by information processing and data analytics can provide important decision support to realize the intelligent tracking, monitoring, management and control. In smart grid environment, smart meters, thermostat and many different smart appliances are used to form a smart building or smart home [127,128], such that the electricity consumption can be monitored and managed in an intelligent manner.

The large amount and different kinds of data collected in the operation of power systems bring opportunities as well as challenges for the DSM in China’s smart grid environment. In the context of Cloud Computing [129] and Big Data [130], the big data in power systems are precious resources. Such as, different types of load patterns can be identiﬁed by load data classiﬁcation [131], which provide important decision support for the implementation of various DSM programs.

We suggest that the strategic signiﬁcance of energy big data should be taken seriously by the government, academia, energy companies and the other participants. At the same time, the security of the data and privacy of consumers should be protected when processing and analyzing the energy big data.

5.5. Government regulations and market policies

In implementing DSM programs, the government’s role should be positioned correctly. In China, the power industry was a government monopoly for a long time. Though many restructuring reform measures have been taken, the power sector in China is still not deregulated, fully open and market-oriented. DSM programs will difﬁcult to succeed without an open and competitive electricity market [132,133].

For the future development of DSM programs in China, we suggest that the government-driven power industry and the command-and-control mechanisms should be changed gradually. More market-oriented DSM policies are necessary to stimulate the active participations of power companies and consumers in DSM programs. The government should play a regulatory role. In the initial promotion stage of DSM programs, more ﬁnancial support should be given by the government. In addition, facing the new situations in implementing DSM programs, more professional and technical personnel should be trained by the government. 6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented a review of the DSM in China in the context of China’s power industry reform. We have presented a brief introduction of the background information, including the socio economic status and geographical location of China, the energy policy of China, the development status and reform of China’s power industry, as well as the smart grid and microgrid in China. The review has demonstrated that both power supply and demand in China had increased rapidly in the past decades. China’s total power generation capacity and consumption were 49,875.5 GWh and 49,762.6 GWh respectively in 2012 [32]. Also, many problems had occurred during the rapid development process of China’s power industry. These problems mainly include the power shortages, high costs and low efﬁciency of electricity production, high emissions, unreasonable pricing and lacking of reliability. In order to deal with these problems, many reform measures of power industry had been implemented in China. Then we have discussed the development of DSM in China, particularly the reform of electricity pricing schemes.

For the future research and developments of DSM in China, we have the following suggestions, both on the policy and technical sides. In terms of policy, government should take more efforts to formulate policies and regulations to further promote customer understanding and participation. On the technical side, technological advances of AMI and ICT are still critical for the improvement of DSM programs in China More in-depth study of economics, operational research and statistics are necessary for the designing of electricity pricing mechanisms and the implementation of optimal scheduling. Also, technical process and scientiﬁc methods of big data analytics and intelligent decision-making are important for the electric power data analysis, thus supporting the effective and efﬁcient decision-makings in China’s DSM programs."
10,Demand-side management (DSM) in the context of China's on-going power sector reform,"As an approach to manage power demand-side resources, DSM plays an important role in electric power system. Though DSM was introduced into China in the early 1990s, its benefits have been underutilized. Using literature study, interview methods and three data sources, this paper examines the likely impacts of China's on-going power sector reform on its DSM. It finds that the major constraints to DSM in China are the insufficient and improper market-based DSM mechanism, grid companies’ low motivations for DSM due to their traditional business model, the underdeveloped energy service industry, and electricity end-users’ low motivation for DSM. China's on-going power sector reform will change power transmission and distribution pricing and grid companies’ business model and introduce competition into retail-side. Drawing on these findings, it is concluded that the likely impacts of the new reform on DSM are: governments may attach more importance to DSM; grid companies may have more motivations for DSM investment; electricity end-users’ motivations for DSM may be both enhanced and dampened; electricity retailers’ motivations for DSM may be dampened; demand response application may be enhanced, and more DSM business models may be developed. Finally, policy implications are provided.","1. Introduction

In March 2015, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council jointly announced further deepening of China's power sector reform (“new reform”). The principles of the new reform are to ensure the stability and reliability of the power system, the marketization of electricity industry, the improvement of people's livelihoods, the promotion of energy conservation and emission reduction, and the enhancement of regulation (NDRC, 2015). The main reform policies are: orderly deregulation of prices in competitive segments (generation and consumption segments); orderly opening up of distribution and retail businesses to non-governmental capital; orderly deregulation of power generation and consumption planning; relatively independent and regulated operation of power trading institutions; and further strengthening of government regulation, planning coordination, as well as stable, eﬃcient and reliable power supply (CPC and the State Council, 2015; NDRC, 2015).

The deﬁnition of the term ‘(power) demand-side management’ coined by Clark Gellings in 1984, has varied over time. The deﬁnition recently given by Peter Warren (2015) is arguably the most comprehensive one to date in terms of its relevance to the 21st century. It encompasses three essential elements of DSM: The ﬁrst element is DSM participants. DSM can be undertaken directly by national or local governments, consumers, third parties or utilities, system operators as well as demand resources aggregators (DRA) which combine smaller load reduction from various consumers as an aggregated load reduction to assist a system operator to participate in balancing, reserve or capacity market. The second element is DSM category. DSM covers the full range of technologies and processes, including energy eﬃciency, energy conservation, price-based and incentive payment-based demand response, on-site generation and on-site storage. The third element is DSM objectives (beneﬁts). DSM aims not only to balance the power system (provide energy security and reliability), to reduce consumer energy bills, but also to attain the prevailing policy objective—carbon emission reduction.

DSM beneﬁts are multifaceted. For power utilities, customers’ load management (load reduction, load growth and load shift) could, on the one hand, reduce the need for building new power plants, and transmission and distribution networks, thus saving investment; and, on the other hand, contribute to the stability and reliability of the power system. For customers, DSM oﬀers the opportunity to reduce their power bills through energy eﬃciency and conservation measures. In the case of industrial customers, this would translate to lower production cost and a more competitive product. For the public, energy conservation and emission reduction through the DSM implementation means environmental and public welfare improvement. For government, DSM reduces the risk of ‘black-outs’ (power supply disruptions), which can have important political repercussions during energy crises, and can help to reduce carbon emissions in order to meet policy targets. Evidently, these beneﬁts are relevant to most of the principles of the on-going power sector reform mentioned above. These include the stability and reliability of the power system, the improvement of people's livelihoods, the promotion of energy conservation and emission reduction.

The Chinese government has recognized the value of demand-side resources in balancing its power system, in saving energy as well as in reducing carbon emissions. Eﬀorts have been made in DSM since the early 1990s when it was introduced into the Country, particularly since 2010 when China's Demand-side Management Measures was issued. However, due to many institutional constraints, DSM has been underused in the country. Existing literature on the institutional constraints to DSM (both in China and other economies) are rare, let alone on the likely impacts of the power sector reforms on DSM.

Using the research method of literature study, interview, and three data sources, this paper seeks to examine the likely impacts of China's new power sector reform launched in March 2015 on DSM. The organization of the paper is as follows: The next section provides literature review on DSM, particularly on the constraints to China's DSM. Section 3 presents research methods and data sources. This is followed by main ﬁndings and discussions in Section 4 which cover the current mechanism for and constraints to DSM implementation in China, as well as the reform policies relevant to DSM; Drawing on these ﬁndings, Section 5 provides conclusions. Policy implications are provided in the last section. DSM has been an underused approach to energy conservation, power system balance and carbon emission reduction in China. English language analyses of China's DSM are few and far between. This paper makes an informed analysis of the likely trajectory of DSM policy implementation in China under the ongoing power sector reform and provides an addition to the literature.

2. Literature review

DSM literature cover three key areas: energy eﬃciency and energy conservation, demand response, and the role of DSM in accommodating renewable energy.

2.1. Energy eﬃciency and energy conservation

China has a long history of establishing government policies that require extensive energy eﬃciency and energy conservation programs, particularly in the industrial sector. Crossley (2014) argued that using energy eﬃciency as a power system resource is particularly important in China, where air pollution from coal-ﬁred power plants is a large and growing problem, and grid companies are the key to using energy eﬃciency as a power system resource in China (Crossley, 2014). A large number of studies have been published on the energy eﬃciency issue in China's individual industries including cement (Zhang et al., 2015), iron and steel (Wang and Lin, 2016), building (Hong et al., 2015), and transport (Zhang, 2011), among others.

With regard to constraints to energy eﬃciency and conservation in China, the literature argued that Chinese ESCOs required “ideal” market conditions, one that was a highly market system of governance supported by well-functioning ﬁnancial intermediaries and legal institutions to enforce contracts. This assumes that ESCOs will be suﬃciently prepared to the task of enhancing China’s energy eﬃciency once the barriers are lifted (Kostka and Shin, 2013). Yang et al. (2002) held that new DSM management mechanism adapted to market economy should be established. Gan (2009) argued that the develop-

Energy Policy 100 (2017) 1–8

ment of energy service companies (ESCOs) in China had been constrained by a variety of factors such as the state of the market, ﬁnance, institutions, technology, energy pricing policies and high transaction costs (Gan, 2009).

2.2. Demand response

In recent years, demand response—a cost-eﬀective demand-side alternative to traditional supply-side generation technologies to balance the power grid—has increasingly gained attention from both researchers and practitioners in the power sector. Shen et al. (2014) analyzed the factors inﬂuencing the development of demand response programs in the US and other countries, and recommended actions for capturing untapped demand response potentials. Walawalkar et al. (2010) argued that there was the gap between perception of ability of demand responses to mitigate variability of renewables and reality of current participation. Both technology and policy changes are required to enable demand response to play a more dynamic role in electricity markets (Walawalkar et al., 2010). Gils (2016) presented a modelbased assessment of the economic demand response potential in Germany (Gils, 2016).

There are a number of Chinese literature on China's demand response. Gao et al. (2013) argued that in China demand response had been largely an administration approach to orderly manage electricity use rather than market-based approach to fully utilize the potential of demand response. Further, Gao pointed out the electricity pricing mechanism in China was rather rigid, and there was a lack of professional load aggregators to make use of demand response resources. Zhang et al. (2013) argued that the essential goal of demand response was to mobilize the user's participation and improve response ability, and proposed three kinds of implementation methods for China: price guidance, incentive compensation and administrative coordination Zhou and Wang (2015) analyzed the new situation and problems of DSM in China, and recommended innovative DSM measures and application of China's demand response. Zeng et al. (2012) put forward the implementation modes of demand response in the initial stage, transition stage and mature stage of electricity market in China considering the level of system operation technology and market environment in each stage. All in all, Chinese literature mainly discussed the necessity to utilize demand response, the constraints to demand response due to lack of market mechanism, and the measures to apply demand response in China's context. It appears in-depth analysis on the constraints to demand response in China are limited.

2.3. The role of DSM in accommodating renewable energy

The large scale penetration of intermittent renewable production has increasingly posed challenges to the power system. Many studies argued that DSM technologies are an option that must be considered to reduce and manage the intermittence of renewable energy. Pedro and Aníbal (2010) analyzed the possible role that DSM can play in enabling the integration of the growing intermittent resources in Portugal. Keane et al. (2011) developed models of demand response on the Irish power system and demonstrated that demand response can contribute to overall system adequacy and can displace some conventional generation.

Along with the dramatic growth of renewable energy (wind power and solar power in particular) in China, serious curtailment of renewable energy has occurred since 2011. This has aroused great concerns from researchers. A number of literature have studied the role of DSM in providing balancing power system with high share of variable renewable energy power generation in China. Zhou (2012) highlighted the signiﬁcance and multiple roles of DSM in China's new context of accelerating green development of national economy and society during the 12th Five-Year Plan Period. Xue et al. (2015) argued that there were signiﬁcant economic and environment beneﬁts to promote renewable energy integration through DSM, and proposed the mode of promoting large-scale intermittent renewable energy by utilizing demand side resources. Zheng et al. (2014) proposed a model of IRSP (integrated resource strategic planning) with interconnected smart grids to integrate more renewable power generation to the grids and implement more DSM projects. Zhou and Yang (2015) studied comprehensively the DSM and demand response programs in China under the context of China's power industry reform. Zhu (2015) argued that the rapid development of renewable energy and new energy has brought about challenges to both power supply side and demand side, and it is necessary to solicit optimal solutions through the interaction between the two sides. Zhu (2003) argued that DSM was a key part of power sector reform, and power sector reform must be integrated with DSM.

To sum up, studies on how institutional factors have constrained DSM development in China are rare, let alone the accounts on the possible impacts of the new round of power sector on DSM in China, and policy directions to promote DSM in the context of the new reforms. This paper seeks to ﬁll this gap.

3. Research methods and data sources

To make an analysis of the likely impacts of the new reform on DSM in China, we need to have a full understanding of the current mechanism for and constraints to DSM, and the major new reform policies relevant to DSM in the country. As such, two research methods, namely, literature study and interview are employed, and three data sources are utilized. Literature study is an appropriate research approach to use when the research is concerned with the existing development status of DSM, as well as the government policies with regard to DSM and the new round of power sector reform. Table 1 shows policy documents and contents on major DSM policy and new reform we studied. In contrast, interview is an appropriate research method to use when the research is concerned with the constraints to DSM development, as well as the possible impacts on DSM development in China, particularly the impacts on the players in DSM program. Table 2 shows the main contents of the interview we conducted during 2015–2016.

4. Main ﬁndings and discussions

4.1. Current mechanism for and constraints to DSM in China

4.1.1. Mechanism for DSM implementation in China

4.1.1.1. Regulation. This includes equipment/building labeling, standards: Utility obligation and administrative load management. Equipment/building labeling: China has issued many eﬃciency codes and standards, product certiﬁcation and labeling programs. For instance, in 2005 a mandatory energy information label known as the China Energy Label (CEL) was established to promote consumer awareness and market transformation. In an eﬀort to reduce energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings, building energy codes, green building ratings, minimum energy performance standards, voluntary ratings programs, and energy-eﬃciency retroﬁts in existing buildings have been implemented across the country. Utility obligation: At the end of 2010, the NDRC released the Demand-side Management (DSM) Measures, mandating that provincial grid companies develop eﬃciency programs as well as load management systems and that annual electricity savings be at least 0.3% of the electricity sale volume and 0.3% of maximum electricity load in the previous year in their business territory (Plunkett et al., 2012). Administrative load management: The government requires manufacturing facilities to adjust production shifts, businesses to stagger working hours, and requires industrial facilities to perform equipment maintenance and conduct employee trainings during peak seasons or peak hours.

4.1.1.2. Financial incentives. This includes loans and subsidies, as well as tax incentives. Loans and subsidies include permitting commercial banks to treat energy performance contracting revenues as part of the security for ESCOs’ energy eﬃciency loans, and government favorable accounting treatment to ESCOs’ energy performance contracting (EPC) transactions, as well as energy saving incentive funds to ESCOs. In addition, there are subsidies for the construction, operation and maintenance of electricity load management systems as well as subsidies for pilot, demonstration and key DSM projects. The sources of subsidies are surcharges on urban public facilities, diﬀerential electricity tariﬀs, and other government ﬁnancial revenue. For example, the Interim Methods for Central Financial Incentive Fund Management of Demand-side Management in Pilot City Projects issued in 2012 provides 440 CNY/kW in east China and 550 CNY/kW in central and west China for DSM facilities, energy eﬃcient power plants and peak shifting/peak shaving technology and other permanent load reductions, as well as 100 CNY/kW for temporary load reduction (NDRC and MOF, 2012). Tax incentives include various tax exemptions have been put in place to support the development of ESCOs. These include exemptions of sales tax, of corporate income tax for the ﬁrst 3 years with proﬁt and 50% for the next year, and of value added tax when ﬁxed assets are transferred to customer (MOF and GTA, 2010).

4.1.1.3. Technical assistance. This includes information dissemination and experience exchange and DSM platform. Information dissemination and experience exchange: The concept of DSM was ﬁrst introduced into China in the early 1990s, and DSM knowledge was initially disseminated through international experts’ speeches at workshops and seminars, and through Chinese experts’

Energy Policy 100 (2017) 1–8

participation in international DSM training programs. In addition, public education programs with respect to DSM knowledge, and experience exchange in DSM pilot projects have been conducted throughout the country. DSM platform: Enabled by modern computing and network technologies, the DSM Service Platform provides real-time consumption monitoring, economic analysis capabilities, DSM implementation and information services. In 2014, the national DSM platform, a comprehensive, professional, open application platform, was built to provide relevant government departments, power companies, power users, power service providers, among others, with the most comprehensive and most authoritative decision-making support and technical services.

4.1.1.4. Market mechanism. This include Commercial energy management and demand response. Commercial energy management: The EPC, a commercial energy management mechanism, was introduced into China in the mid-1990s through the cooperation between the Chinese government and international organizations. When an EPC contract is concluded, the ESCOs will provide the energy end-users with an energy conservation audit, ﬁnancing and innovation service, and then recover investments and obtain reasonable proﬁts through sharing in energy-saving beneﬁts. In this way, the energy end-users can reduce energy operating expenses and technological risks associated with such renovation. ESCOs typically carry out projects under one or more of three types of contracts: shared savings contract, guaranteed savings contract and fee serving contract. This market-based EPC turns out to be successful. ESCOs have developed very rapidly in China. The amount of EPC projects reached 74.2 billion CNY in 2013, 87 times of that in 2003 (MOF and GTA, 2010).

Demand response (DR). There are basically two measures to implement DR. Price-based DR, such as real-time pricing (RTP), critical-peak pricing (CPP) and time-of-use (TOU) pricing, gives customers time-varying rates that reﬂect the value and cost of electricity in diﬀerent time periods. Incentive-based DR pays participating customers to reduce their loads at times requested by the program sponsor, triggered either by a grid reliability problem or high electricity prices. TOU tariﬀs have been adopted in many places in China to encourage industrial and commercial customers to shift loads from peak to oﬀ-peak. In recent years, China has sought to incentivize active user participation in peak [super peak] load usage reduction and voluntary participation in DR, to improve peak pricing and setting seasonal pricing. Some places have created incentive programs to voluntarily shift or shed their load during the peak. In the summer of 2015, incentive-based DR was implemented in Beijing, Jiangsu province, and Foshan (Guangdong province). The central government's special fund provides 100 CNY/kW for temporary peak load reduction through DR. In Beijing, the payment for DR is categorized into three levels: 80 CNY/kW, 100 CNY/kW and 120 CNY/kW for 24 h, 4 h and half an hour response time respectively. The payment for temporary DR in Jiangsu and Foshan is 100 CNY/kW, and 130 CNY/kW respectively (Zhao et al., 2015; St. John, 2015).

4.1.1.5. Others. This include DSM pilot program and priority accession to direct power trading. DSM pilot program: China's cities and provinces have initiated DSM pilot programs since late 1990 s. For instance, in 2012 China launched the DSM Pilot City Program and chose four cities—Beijing, Suzhou (Jiangsu Province), Tangshan (Hebei Province), and Foshan (Guangdong Province)—to demonstrate the value of DSM as a resource. As part of the pilot program, each city speciﬁed target for power conservation and load shifting to be achieved over a three-year period (2013–2015), as well as provided co-funding in addition to the ﬁnancial incentives provided by the central government (Xue et al., 2015). For instance, Beijing proposed to reduce its peak load by 800 MW, accounting for 4.8% of the city's maximum load, focusing primarily on the commercial sector which comprises a key part of Beijing's local economy (BDRC, 2013).

Priority accession to direct power trading: In July 2013, the National Energy Administration (NEA) promulgated the On the Issues of Current Direct Power Trading between Electricity End-users and Power Generation Companies providing that enterprises participated in DSM programs are eligible to get access to direct power trading, and diﬀerent regions can take diﬀerent policies for access to direct power trading (NEA, 2013). As such, Ningxia requires that participation in DSM be an essential rather than priority condition to get access to direct power trading (IDSM, 2014).

4.1.2. Constraints to DSM implementation in China

4.1.2.1. Insuﬃcient and improper market-based DSM mechanism. Among all of the policies and measures adopted in China, regulation (administration) options are used most often for both energy eﬃciency and load management. Though experience to date shows that mandatory measures can eﬀectively and quickly reduce demand during peak times, there are signiﬁcant economic costs resulting from mandatory closure of industrial operations. As such, the Chinese government has introduced market-based measures such as DR to address the load problem. In April 2015, A regulation to govern the DSM for electricity load management was issued, which provides that ‘users’ participation in peak and critical peak load usage reduction and voluntary participation in DR will be incentivized, peak pricing will be improved and seasonal pricing will be set and implemented before the end of June 2015 (NDRC and MOF, 2015). The coverage scope and regional use of peak pricing will expand, and price-based DR will gain more incentives’. Nevertheless, local governments have preferred to use administrative measures to control electricity demand rather than to solicit more ﬂexible demand from large electricity consumers due to the simplicity nature of these measures.

As previously noted, DR refers to the electricity customers changes in their electricity consumption pattern in response to price signals or incentive payments. Diﬀerentiatial pricing, tiered pricing, peak-valley tariﬀ, critical peaking pricing, as well as rewards to temporary reduction of peak load have been adopted in some of the pilot cities. However, the experience in these cities shows that the improper pricing has hindered DR application. For example, the gap between the peak and valley price is too small to allow electricity customers to recover their cost such as production rescheduling cost incurred from participating DR. It is reported that the gap is less than 4 fold, much lower than the 5–8 fold or even 9–10 fold gap between of peak and valley prices in other countries such as the USA (St. John, 2015). Such being the case, electricity customers have been disincentived to change their electricity use pattern.

4.1.2.2. Grid companies’ low motivations for DSM due to their business model. Under the existing power sector regime, grid company revenue in China is the margin between the electricity retail tariﬀ and the on-grid tariﬀ, which means that the revenue is tied to electricity sales. In 2011, the central government established an energy eﬃciency obligation that required grid companies to implement energy eﬃciency as noted in Section 4.1.1. However, as it is common with electricity utilities in other economies, Chinese grid companies are concerned about the reduction of revenue that results from encouraging customers to use electricity more eﬃciently. This is exacerbated in China because the government evaluates the performance of grid companies primarily on the revenue they earn

and the proﬁt they make. Revenue reduction is therefore a major barrier to grid company implementation of energy eﬃciency and energy eﬃciency has been slow to become a core part of the grid company mission.

4.1.2.3. Underdeveloped energy service industry. Despite the rapid market expansion, ESCOs have faced multiple constraints that prevent them from achieving further improvement. One of the main constraints of DSM implementation in China is the creditworthiness and diﬃculties faced by the ESCOs in arranging ﬁnancing for their projects. Financing is thus the burning question for ESCOs to development. In recent years, although ESCOs already have suﬃcient capability to carry out eﬃciency power plant projects in some places, many lack the capability to serve as DSM resources aggregators (Gan, 2009; Kostka and Shin, 2013). In general, the energy service industry in China has been underdeveloped.

4.1.2.4. Electricity end-users’ low motivations for DSM. The introduction of DSM into China was driven originally by the need to reduce peak load at a time of power shortages in the early 1990s to secure the national economy. As a result, power utilities have been the main entities responsible for DSM implementation. Electricity end-users in China generally have low motivations for DSM due to little awareness of DSM knowledge, as well as lack of technical assistance in DSM participation.

4.2. New reform policies relevant to DSM The new reform is centered on orderly deregulation and liberalization of power tariﬀs for competitive areas in the value chain of the power sector, except transmission and distribution; orderly grant of market access to power distribution and retail business to nongovernmental capital; orderly deregulation and liberalization of the planning of power generation and consumption except the planning for public welfare and regulation reasons (CPC and the State Council, 2015; An et al., 2015). The new reform policies relevant to DSM are documented as follows.

4.2.1. New transmission and distribution tariﬀ policy Transmission and distribution price reform is essential for electricity tariﬀ reform. Under the new transmission and distribution tariﬀ policy, the transmission and distribution tariﬀ, namely the ‘grid access fee’, is to be determined on the basis of allowable revenue, allowable cost and taxes. Pilot transmission and distribution tariﬀ reforms have been carried out since the end of 2014 in western Inner Mongolia and Shenzhen, and is expanding to ﬁve other provincial grid regions: Anhui, Hubei, Ningxia, Yunnan and Guizhou (Lin and Li, 2015). In Shenzhen's transmission and transmission pilot reform scheme (the scheme),

where T & D P stands for the transmission and distribution price; AR is the allowable revenue consisting of allowable cost (AC) which includes the depreciation cost and operation and maintenance fee), allowable proﬁt (AP) which includes the amount of the eﬀective computable and accrued assets multiplied by weighted average capital/earnings ratio) and taxes (T). Q is the quantity of electricity transmitted and distributed. The eﬀective computable and accrued assets refer to the assets invested by the power grid enterprises to obtain investment income, the speciﬁc items of which are to be determined the government pricing department. The transmission and distribution tariﬀ, once capped (determined) by the government, will last for three consecutive years (NDRC, 2014).

Most importantly, the scheme provides that power grid companies should improve business management and enhance eﬃciency, so as to lower their costs below the allowable cost, and the grid companies can keep 50% of their cost savings. Further, the eﬃciency performance of the grid companies will be duly considered in the next veriﬁcation period of transmission and distribution tariﬀ. In addition, the scheme states that the government pricing agency and relevant electricity industry regulation agency shall jointly establish a reward and penalty mechanism to assess the operational eﬃciency and service quality of the grid companies. Proper reward will be granted for performance (such as innovation, general services, reliability services, among others) which is better than required by the government. Otherwise, penalties will be imposed. Meanwhile, a mechanism will be developed to evaluate the creditworthiness of grid companies (NDRC, 2014).

4.2.2. Power generation and consumption planning policy Under the new reform, power generation and consumption planning will be revamped in an orderly manner through the establishment of a mechanism for priority power purchase and sales and gradual increase of the proportion of direct power trading between generators and large users. This implies that, on the one hand, in special circumstances such as a power shortage, orderly power consumption is required for some particular end-users to ensure reliable and stable operation of the power system; on the other hand, power consumption planning is necessary for public welfare services and regulation (NDRC, 2015).

The merit order of power dispatch will follow the following principle:

Category I: Renewable power such as wind power, solar power, and biomass power, the development of which are incorporated in the national renewable energy development planning; peak and frequency regulation power; coal-ﬁred co-generation power in the heating supply season to meet certain requirements; Category II: Inter-regional and inter-provincial transmitted power under the national planning and local government agreement to ensure the transmission of clean energy; hydropower, nuclear power, generation by residual heat, residual pressure and residual gas, and coal-ﬁred power with super low emissions. Category III: The others.

The new reform emphasizes the expansion of the current provincial-level pilot programs that allow electricity end-users to bypass the grid companies and negotiate power purchase prices directly with generators. Both demand-side and supply-side parties are to be screened, with participation limited to those demonstrating good performance in terms of energy eﬃciency and compliance with environmental regulations.

4.2.3. Electricity retail business policy The new policy for the electricity retail business encompasses three components: 1) Market access to power retail business is granted to non-governmental capital. Thus, the current monopoly of grid companies in this business segment will be broken; 2) The access to incremental distribution business is granted to non-governmental capital, to allow new entrants to break the state-owned distribution monopolies’ grip on distribution 3) Power end-users will be granted gradually options to choose power retailers (NDRC, 2015).

4.3. Discussions

China has made eﬀorts to implement DSM programs over the past two decades and various DSM mechanism and measures have been put in place. Market-oriented DSM tools such as incentive-based DR have been tested in recent years. However, DSM application has been limited, and the potential of DSM as an alternative to supply side resources has yet to be fully tapped. There are a number of barriers stand in the way of implementing eﬀective DSM programs in China. These include the insuﬃcient and improper market-based DSM mechanisms, grid companies’ low motivations for DSM due to their traditional business model, the underdeveloped energy service industry, and electricity end-users’ low motivations for DSM.

The core of the new round of electricity sector reform lies in tariﬀ reform aimed at promoting competitive pricing in the wholesale and retail markets, while strictly regulating power transmission and distribution tariﬀ. In this way, an eﬀective tariﬀ transmission mechanism shall be established from the upstream to the downstream of the power sector. In addition to prices being set by the market, generation planning and retail-side power consumption planning will also be increasingly determined by the market. Generation-side and retail-side competition will become much more intense. As private funding of retailers liberalizes, there will be more pathways to breed market entities (An et al., 2015).

5. Conclusions: Possible impacts of the new reform on China's DSM

5.1. Governments may attach more importance to DSM

One of the ﬁve basic principles of the new reform outlined in Document No. 9 is energy savings, emissions reductions, and increased use of renewable and distributed generation. This strikes a diﬀerent tone from State Council Decree No. 5 for the last round electricity market reform initiated in 2002 which put much less emphasis on environmental and emissions concerns. This principle of Document No. 9 is embodied throughout some of the supporting reform documents. For example, out of the nine tasks with regard to the electricity market, two are related to renewable energy: one is the new mechanism for renewable energy to participate power trading; the other is the generation quota exchange mechanism which aims to encourage the high-cost power units to sell all or part of their generation quotas to low-cost units (such as renewable energy units). In addition, Document No. 9 includes very useful, positive language on DSM and end-use energy eﬃciency, as well as distributed generation. It calls for the removal of market access barriers and distributed generation to be allowed to participate in power trading.

Although over the past years China has made remarkable achievements in renewable energy, particularly wind power and solar power, renewable energy curtailment has been serious since 2010 as renewable energy installed capacity has increased. A number of studies have shown that one way to tackle this conundrum is to manage the demand for electricity more eﬀectively, manipulating it through a variety of measures to introduce more ﬂexibility into the system and balance supply and demand. However, to date, DSM has not well played its role in this respect in China due to its underdevelopment. Nevertheless, it is expected that the emphasis on renewable energy under the new reform will bring about more emphasis on DSM in the country.

5.2. Grid companies may have more motivations for DSM investment

As noted in Section 4, under the new reform, the grid company's revenue will be determined by the transmission and distribution tariﬀ rather than the margin between the retail tariﬀ and the on-grid tariﬀ under the existing electricity sector regime. This change of the grid company business model will undoubtedly remove the barrier of existing grid company business model to DSM as the grid company's revenue will no longer be tied to the volume of electricity sales. In addition, the provision that grid companies can receive 50% of the beneﬁt accrued from the diﬀerence between operation cost and allowable cost will enhance grid companies’ motivations in DSM (eﬃciency improvement). 5.3. Electricity end-users’ motivations for DSM are two fold

The impacts of the new reform on electricity end-users’ motivations for DSM are twofold. On the one hand, along with more applications of DR measures, the energy service market will grow, implying that more competitive energy management services will be available, which will help to raise electricity end-users’ motivations for DSM. On the other hand, the direct electricity trading between electricity end-users and generators will possibly help to bring down the retail price. As a result, the proportion of electricity bill in the total production cost of electricity end-users may be reduced. This, in turn, could possibly dampen electricity customers’ motivations for power saving.

5.4. Electricity retailers’ motivations for DSM may be dampened

Along with opening up electricity retail business, the competition in the electricity retail market will be increasing. Electricity retailers will be motivated to sell as much electricity as possible through, for instance, oﬀering competitive prices to electricity end-users. Since DSM measures such as energy eﬃciency and conservation on the electricity customers’ side may reduce the revenue of electricity retailers, the electricity retailers’ motivations to engage in DSM would be dampened.

5.5. DR application may be enhanced

DR, by using prices or incentives to change the energy/load shape, is considered a critical option for optimizing the balance between power supply and demand. There are two prerequisites for DR application: electricity price signals must be passed on to end-users and end-users must be in a position to fully manage their load (increase or reduce electricity use). There must be a close alignment between customers’ electricity prices and the value they place on electricity. However, China's existing electricity regime poses challenges to DR application. Unlike the United States and Europe, China has no true wholesale market for electricity. Instead, annual generation quotas are assigned to power plant owners by the government based on ﬁxed wholesale prices. The lack of linkage between the cost of producing power and the value it has at diﬀerent times of the day or the year has also made it diﬃcult to incentivize power plants to participate DR.

DR's signiﬁcance is already taking shape in China’s new round of power sector reforms. Beijing, Shanghai, and other DSM pilot cities have been testing DR projects since 2014. In April 2015, following Document No. 9, NDRC released Notice of Improving Electricity Emergency Mechanism, and the Comprehensive Demand-Side Management in Pilot City Projects, continuing to strengthen emphasis on DSM and demand response. It is expected that DR will develop rapidly across the country. However, more rational peak pricing mechanisms will be required to incentivize DR development in China, as will be discussed in Section 6.

5.6. More DSM business models may be developed

Along with the advancement of electricity market liberalization, more business models based on demand side resources are now possible. In this respect, Behrangrad (2015) made an in-depth analysis on possible business models that DSM providers can adopt in relation to segments of a typical electricity market: system operation, generation, transmission/distribution, energy retailing and load. Mahdi divided DSM resources into energy eﬃciency (EE) and demand response (DR) resources.

Possible business models for DR can be described as: 1) For system operation, business models are system reliability enhancement (such as ancillary service market participation, contract-based reliability enhancing services, frequency regulation), capacity provision and market eﬃciency enhancement; for transmission/distribution, they are redu-

Energy Policy 100 (2017) 1–8

cing variable generation unit intermitteny cost, generation-load balancing service, load shaping; 2) For transmission/distribution, business models are mitigation of the ‘congestion’ of network; 3) For energy retailing, business models are procure improvement (such as interruptible load incentive, discounted energy rate in return for load interruption option, capacity management, load shaping); 4) For load, business models are price-based behavioral DR (such as providing data awareness, provide a system to react to energy prices), grid cost reduction, incentive sharing for DR action, grid independence support.

6. Policy implications

Drawing on the above analysis, policy implications for China's DSM are as follows.

6.1. Improve DR incentives

An estimation of the DR market potential by a GTM research report in 2012 showed that China's DR market potential would reach US$300 million by 2016. It was estimated that roughly 5% of China's peak electric load, or about 60 gigawatts, is generated in only about 50 h per year (NEA, 2013). That is an attractive target for technologies that can reduce loads at homes, businesses, factories or government facilities via price signals or market payments. However, it has been shown that the DR policies in the pilot cities have two drawbacks: all are incentivebased and the incentives are not suﬃcient to recover the costs for shifting or reducing load. For instance, the rewards for DR in Beijing previously mentioned are considered too low to incentivize electricity consumers (Zhao et al., 2015).

Under the new reform, China needs to consider more aggressive implementation of price-based DR for electricity end-users as a high priority. However, price-based DR cannot be achieved immediately for all electricity users. The conventional metering and billing systems for most electricity users are not adequate for charging time-varying rates and most users are not used to making electricity decision on a daily or hourly basis. The transformation to time-varying retail rates will not happen quickly. Consequently, fostering DR through incentive-based programs will help improve eﬃciency and reliability while price-based DR grows. More eﬃcient pricing of retail electricity service is crucial. Further analysis should be strengthened on the beneﬁts of DR options to ensure that they are both eﬀective at providing needed demand reduction and cost-eﬀective.

6.2. Strengthen regulations on grid companies’ participation in DSM

The grid companies’ new business model will eliminate the conﬂict between grid companies’ revenue and DSM implementation, and performance-based incentives will be provided to motivate the grid companies’ DSM participation in DSM with clear performance reward and penalty system. However, the regulation of these incentives’ implementation should be strengthened, and the performance reward and penalty system should be reviewed regularly and improved. In addition, government standards for assessing the performance of the state-owned grid companies and their executives should be deﬁned and made public, so that the success or failure of the grid companies’ eﬀorts to increase end-use energy eﬃciency in their customers’ facilities becomes an important performance metric.

Meanwhile, in China's current power sector regime, grid operation data (including electricity use data) is still held closely by grid companies, and there is a lack of public channels to get access to these data. As a result, non-grid companies providing DR tend to lack the data for economic operation analysis. For electricity end-users, lack of real-time electricity usage data makes them diﬃcult to build enthusiasms for DR participation. Further, under the new power sector regime, there will be three categories of electricity retailers: 1) Retailers subordinated to the grid company; 2) Owners of incremental distribution networks; 3) Non-governmental investors. Since the ﬁrst category of retailers have the privilege in access to grid operation data, unfair competition may arise between the three categories of retailers if grid operation data is not accessible to the public. It is therefore recommended that the grid companies be obligated to release the grid operation data within the bounds of law.

6.3. Incentivize electricity retailers’ motivations for DSM

One of the best ways to implement DSM is to adopt a policy that electricity retailers have an obligation to deliver a cost-eﬀective energyeﬃciency service. This policy can be implemented through government regulations and through the standard conditions included in each retail company's license. The policy should oblige retail companies to improve electricity use eﬃciency, optimize electricity use pattern and increase the proportion of renewable energy consumption for electricity consumers, subject to rewarded, otherwise be punished. The new oversight by the NDRC. Those which perform their obligations well should be reform can be considered successful if competition at the retail side leads to more eﬀective energy conservation, energy eﬃciency, and emission reduction.

6.4. Integrate demand side sources into power sector planning

One of the drivers of the new reform that diﬀers from that of China's power sector reform in 2002 is the increasing integration of renewable energy and consequent intermittency at both power generation and demand side. This upgrades the signiﬁcance of power sector planning. Although China has placed a high priority on improving end-use energy eﬃciency in every sector, has set binding targets for the overall energy intensity of the economy and has implemented a broad set of policies and programs that support comprehensive investment in energy eﬃciency, energy eﬃciency as a cost-eﬀective resource to meet demand for energy service has yet to be well integrated into power sector planning.

Integrating DSM into power sector planning will assure that future DSM goals are technically and economically justiﬁed. To this end, China needs to fully evaluate the contributions that demand-side resources, including ﬂexible demand response (load management) for eﬃcient grid integration of variable renewable resources, to assess the cost of various generation and energy eﬃciency options, to request for stakeholder input, to employ modern power planning tools such as the Resource Portfolio Model (RPM), to make an overall ‘resource strategy’.

11,Development mode for renewable energy power in China: Electricity pool and distributed generation units,"Distributed generation (DG) units can provide approaches and methodologies for the utilization and development of renewable energy. Meanwhile, electricity pool (EP), as a mode which can adapt to China’s energy and power market, can effectively promote the market competition. After analyzing China’s energy and power market, this paper, combining characteristics of distributed generation units with electricity pool, proposes Base–Market–Assist (BMA) in the pool mode. BMA mode not only makes a rational division according to China energy resources’ endowment, but also utilizes agent operators to conduct operation management of distributed generation units, providing new methods for China renewable energy development in aspects of technology, market and policy.","1. Introduction

China’s renewable energy develops in a period with both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, under the support of government policies, China’s renewable energy industry has developed rapidly. On the other hand, China’s renewable energy industry still has a lot of problems to be solved at current crucial stage of development. Only to overcome these obstacles can China’s renewable energy industry have a sustainable development.

1.1. Present situation of China’s renewable energy In the last three years, the government of China increased efforts in support for renewable energy, the renewable energy industry support are more abundant than ever before [1]. As of 2012, China’s installed capacity of grid-connected wind power has reached to 75,324 MW; the new installed capacity has reached to more than 12,000 MW. The electric energy production of wind power has exceeded 100 billion kilowatts, which accounts for more than 2% of the total, and wind power has become the third main power supply after the thermal power and hydropower. The new installed capacity of photovoltaic power is more than 4500 MW, the cumulative installed capacity is more than 8020 MW kilowatts [2]. In 2013, China’s new energy power industry is developing more rapidly. The installed capacity of wind power, solar power and hydroelectric has respectively reached to 91,413 MW, 91,413 MW, 15,100 MW and 12,226 MW, respectively, until the end of 2013 (Fig. 1).

1.2. Development opportunity of China’s renewable energy On the other hand, China’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–2015) explicitly put forward the strategic plan for the development of new energy to promote multiple clean development of energy, strengthen the construction of grid-connected matching projects

Fig. 1. Domestic installed capacity of wind power, solar power, biomass power in past years.

and effectively develop wind power, actively develop new energy such as solar power, biomass energy, geothermal energy etc., popularize the application of distributed energy resources system and take new energy construction as the focus of the transformation of energy production and energy utilization [3]. Apparently new energy construction has become a key task for China’s transformation and upgrading and improvement of industry’s core competitiveness. China’s White Paper of Energy Policy 2012 proposed to vigorously develop renewable energy. At the end of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption over primary energy consumption would reach to 11.4%, while the proportion of installed capacity of non-fossil energy would reach to 30% [4]. In August 2012, China ofﬁcially launched the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development” and released four thematic plans including hydropower, wind power, solar energy and biomass energy, putting forward clearly the guiding ideology, basic principles, development goals, key tasks, industrial layout, safeguard measures and implementation mechanisms of China’s renewable energy development, which had made a new developing stage of China’s renewable energy.

In January 2014, renewable energy was put in a very important position in China’s national energy working conference, in which the Ten Key Work was proposed. Three attempts out of the Ten Key Work are to vigorously develop renewable energy and promote energy green development. The conference put forward clearly to adhere to both centralized and distributed, combine centralized supply and consumption on the spot, steadily promote the development of hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy, geothermal energy and other renewable energy development. In 2014, the newly approved installed capacity of hydropower is 20,000 MW; the newly approved installed capacity of wind power is 18,000 MW; the newly approved installed capacity of photovoltaic power is 14,000 MW (including distributed generation accounted for 60%); the newly approved installed capacity of nuclear power is 8640 MW [5]. All the above show that China’s renewable energy development will usher in opportunities.

1.3. Development obstacles China has currently reached a considerable scale in the renewable energy industry [6]. However, compared with developed countries, there is still a wide gap in such respects as resource assessment, technological level, cost control and market mechanism. Bottlenecks still exist in the development process of renewable energy (Fig. 2).

1.3.1. Resources exploitation obstacles Because of wide varieties and broad scope, energy resources in China have a high requirement in exploitation and evaluation of resources. In addition, the evaluation work of China’s renewable energy is not enough [6]. In terms of solar energy assessment, for one thing, there is no large-scale distribution diagram or zoning ﬁgure. For another, the statistics from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) of wind and solar assessment center mostly tends to be national ones, which limits the regional planning and utilization of China’s solar energy resources. In terms of wind power resources assessment, what the most cited currently are wind resource maps CMA has published, and there is no other authoritative data released by wind power authentication advisory mechanism. In addition, biomass resources assessment are more concentrated on the amount of resources of existing agricultural and forestry crops, and there is no systematic evaluation currently in the resources potential of marginal land under different circumstances and in the inﬂuences the bio-fuel development has on food security. All the above reasons prevent Chinese renewable energy from exploiting and utilizing and are also adverse to resource consumption.

1.3.2. Technology obstacles Although China’s renewable energy industry has developed rapidly in recent years, there are still large gaps in key technologies compared with the developed countries. Basic research and technological innovation are still poor, the research of key technology and generic technology is lagged behind, and the core competitiveness of renewable energy industry is not strong. At present, many domestic power generation devices such as high-power wind generation units, biomass power generating boiler, poly-silicon furnace and nuclear power equipment based on emerging technology basically depend on importation [6].

Although there are some scientiﬁc and technological enterprises of new energy such as the Gold Wind Limited Co. and the Sun-tech Power Limited Co. to contend against the foreign production, problems of small-scale, low-level intensiﬁcation, backward technology and other issues still exist in most new energy equipment manufacturers. Generally, the technical content of their product is relatively low and the quality is unstable.

1.3.3. Costs obstacles In China, renewable energy products have a high cost for development and utilization. Characteristics such as uneven distribution of resources, complexity of technology, small market scale, and lack of stability of renewable energy cause the situation. As shown in Fig. 3, assuming that China’s domestic coal-ﬁred power generation cost is 1, then the cost of nuclear power generation is slightly higher than that of coal, biomass’s cost is 1.5, wind’s is 1.7, and the cost of solar power generation is 11 to 18 [6]. The expansion of new energy capacity can be restrained by excessive cost; conversely the narrow market can establish obstacles to the reduction of cost, and create a vicious cycle. However, Chinese market cannot break this vicious cycle on its own strength. To break such vicious cycle, the preferential policies and incentives released by the government should be depended on.

1.3.4. Market obstacles The existing energy management system in China is established on conventional energy. The power system operation and management mechanisms mainly focus on the characteristics of large power supply and grids. Therefore, considerations of the establishment of renewable energy system are inadequate in the process of China’s power market model design and application. In addition, the inﬂuence of renewable energy intermittency on power system operation is increasingly prominent with the large scale grid-connected, which leads to further study of the mode of putting the renewable energy power generation into the power market.

Therefore, we have reasons to believe that renewable energy has great potential for development in China, and obstacles also exist. Thus, in order to develop a new way, which is adapting to the Chinese characteristics, the utilization of renewable energy is of great signiﬁcance.

1.4. Issues: A decent choice

1.4.1. Distributed generation units In China, due to uneven distribution, impossibility of continuously producing and high power generating cost, the abundant renewable energy is difﬁcult to use and consume. Distributed generation (DG) provides a new method for China to improve centralized power supply mode and optimize the integrated utilization efﬁciency for renewable energy [7–9].

The deﬁnition of DG is summarized as the power generating equipment directly arranged in the distribution or surrounding the charge and can generate electricity economically, efﬁciently and reliably, which is earliest proposed in the U.S. Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act in 1978 [10,11]. In China, DG refers to the power generating equipment the energy cascade multi cogeneration facilities with power output based on the operation mode of client generation spontaneously for private use and having an access to the grid in redundant power [12]. This kind of generation is installed at or near users’ location and can adjust and balance the distribution management system. DG consists of fuel cells, solar photovoltaic cells, wind power, biomass power and ocean energy power etc. [12]. Compared with traditional models, DG has many advantages [13]. First, it can adequately develop and utilize varieties of distributed energy to optimize the utilization efﬁciency and reduce pollution [14,15]; second, it has advantages of not subjecting to geographical restrictions [16,17], ﬂexible scale [18], pollution-free [19], local high safety [20] and the ability to compensate for the deﬁciency of security and stability of China grid [21,22].

1.4.2. Electricity pool To meet the development trend of renewable energy and promote its large-scale connection to power grid, China must improve the electricity market operation mode. In China’s powerbased electricity market, the electricity pool mode is still the main form that need to be explored [23,24].

Electricity pool (EP) is the market transaction place operated by SGCC (State Grid Corporation of China) (Fig. 4). In this mode, electricity can be sold and competitive price can be formed, ultimately reaching a balance between demand and supply in Table 2 China’s primary energy consumption structure (million tons of oil equivalent).

both power generation and charge with reasonable price [25]. The electricity production and price in the support-demand transaction must be determined by market competition in which generation companies can gain the right of power generation and power distributors can buy the electricity only in the pool. In electricity pool market, a set of works such as electricity market operation, the system scheduling operation and transmission grid management are in the charge of a uniﬁed system or several separate institutions [26]. Also in this mode, market equilibrium can be quickly achieved by using price mechanism, which is an important way to ensure grid safety [27]. What is more, pool’s coerciveness prescribes that market participants must trade under central management, reducing the autonomy of participants [28,29]. In China, the macro-control dominating inﬂuence on power price is greater than that of the market [30,31]. The improvement and trials of EP has provided possibility for renewable energy to connect the power grid.

From the perspective of the status and trends of China’s renewable energy development, summarizing and analyzing Chinese corresponding policy tools, starting with the EP and DG mode, this paper conducts a research on the new mode of renewable energy generation in accordance with the characteristics of China’s energy and power market. 2. Status quo

2.1. Overview of China’s renewable energy In March 2006, the Eleventh Five Year Plan put forward the following measures for the energy industry which were to try preferential taxation, investment policy and mandatory market share policy, to encourage the production and consumption of renewable energy, and to improve its proportion in primary energy [32].

In August 2007, China enact the “Renewable Energy Mid- and Long-term Development Program” to boost the large-scale development of wind power through Franchise bidding; to support the application of solar photovoltaic power generation by sending electricity to villages and providing living electricity for population without electricity; to actively developing rural household biogas to improve rural environmental sanitation and increase rural income; to popularize solar water heaters with the market driven; to actively promote the development of the biomass power generating and biology liquid fuel with technology development and pilot demonstration as the forerunner [33].Under the guidance of national policies, China’s renewable energy industry has developed rapidly. Until the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan, China had over-achieved the main developing goal of renewable energy. Details are as shown in Table 1.

In October 2010, the Twelfth Five Year Plan once again clearly indicated that China should propel multiple clean development of energy; strengthen the construction of parallel in matching engineering and effectively develop the wind power; positively develop the photovoltaic power, biomass power and geothermal energy etc. [3].

In July 2012, on the basis of organizationally planning the specialized project of twelfth ﬁve year program of hydroelectric, wind power, solar power and biomass power, the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration formulated the “Twelfth Five Year Plan for Renewable Energy”, putting forward the guiding ideology, basic principles, development target, main tasks, industrial distribution, guarantee measures and implementation mechanism of renewable energy from 2011 to 2015. These more speciﬁc task placements have accelerated the development of China’s renewable energy.

Under the guidance of national policies, China’s renewable energy structure is improving continuously. The proportion of natural gas and other clean energy is rising continuously. In 2013, China’s primary energy production structures is: raw coal accounted for 75.6%; oil accounted for 8.9%; natural gas accounted for 4.6%; hydropower, nuclear power and wind power accounted for 10.9% (Fig. 5). And the consumption structure is: raw coal accounted for 66%; oil accounted for 18.4%; natural gas accounted for 5.8%; hydropower, nuclear power, wind power accounted for 9.8% (Fig. 6) [34]. Moreover, from the historical data of BP Amoco’s “Statistical Review of World Energy” we can also see that in China, hydropower and renewable energy development is the fastest (Table 2) [35]. China’s renewable energy industry has developed towards a healthy direction.

2.2. Current situation and trend of distributed generation Until July 2012, China’s total installed capacity of distributed generation has reached 34.36 million kilowatts, including 23.76 million kilowatts of distributed hydroelectric, 7.3 million kilowatts of resource comprehensive utilization, 1.41 million kilowatts of biomass power generation, 1.03 million kilowatts of photovoltaic power generation, 0.48 million kilowatts of distributed wind power and 0.38 million kilowatts of gas installations, speciﬁcally shown in Fig. 7.

Meanwhile, China has made a clear blueprint on the future state of distributed generation to reach 64 million kilowatts in 2015 and 154 million kilowatts in 2020, respectively. Details are as shown in Fig. 8.

So we can see that, China will vigorously develop distributed generation. The planning was not only on the total amount, but also on each kind of renewable energy:

(1) Development trend of wind power The phenomenon of wind curtailment is so serious in China [36,37]. Thus the speciﬁc plan of wind power in the future mainly focuses on the nine wind power bases and the application of offshore wind power to keep scale merit (Fig. 9).

(2) Development trend of solar power The phenomenon of excess capacity in Chinese photovoltaic industry is prominent [38,39]. Therefore, we should give equal attention to both the centralized generation and the distributed one (Fig. 10), gradually put particular emphasis on the distributed generation in the plan of Chinese solar power. At the same time, we should also lay stress on the development of new type of energy storage technology to alleviate the problem of excess production capacity.

(3) Development trend of hydroelectric The speciﬁc plan for Chinese hydroelectric in the future still focuses on the construction of large-scale hydropower station in the district with abundant and stable water resource, with distributed generation station as a complementary (Fig. 11). Meanwhile, regional climate change brought by large hydropower station such as the Three Gorges Power Station must be included in the consideration in terms of Chinese hydropower construction.

(4) Development trend of biomass power With the restricts of supply difﬁculties in power generation materials, high cost in generating, weak market demand and the problem of “land-use competition”, biomass power generation in China is still in the primary stage, therefore a smaller planning is planned (Table 3).

2.3. Policy tools

In order to propel the utilization and development of Chinese renewable energy, broad policy support has been provided to the extension and utilization of renewable energy and distributed generation, which is playing a guiding role.

2.3.1. Guiding policy Since the distributed generation has been an important tool for the exploitation and utilization of China’s renewable energy, both the central and the local Chinese governments introduce policies to promote the comprehensive utilization of renewable energy and the development of distributed generation (Table 4).

2.3.2. Franchise bidding policy At the early stage of the development of onshore wind power, photovoltaic generation, photo-thermal power generation, offshore wind power, National Energy Administration adopted franchise bidding to decrease electric price and promote the scale development of new energy power generation (Table 5).

2.3.3. Feed-in tariff The new energy policy of feed-in tariff has been adopted to boost the renewable energy connect the grid and take the cost into consideration (Table 6).

2.3.4. Investment subsidies policy Special subsidies for eligible ﬁxed assets investment projects of renewable energy supported by a grant from central government budge has been allocated to encourage the development of renewable energy industry.

(1) Golden Sun demonstrative project In 2009, China’s Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and Bureau of Energy jointly issued the “Notice on the implementation of golden sun demonstrative project” (Finance Building [2009] No. 397), indicating that subsidies of 50% of the total investment of photovoltaic generation system and its counter-part transmission and distribution project should be provided in principle for golden sun demonstrative project, while 70% of total investment should be given as subsidies for independent photovoltaic generation system in remote districts with less electricity.

(2) Photovoltaic building demonstrative project In 2009, China’s Ministry of Finance and Building Department jointly issued “Suggestions on the implementation of accelerating the promotion of photovoltaic building application” (Finance Building [2009] No. 128), providing subsidies to different photovoltaic building demonstration projects in different areas. Subsidies for photovoltaic integrated project highly and ﬁrmly combined with buildings are 9 Yuan 1 per watt, while subsidies for the formation-using project generally combined with buildings are 7.5 Yuan per watt.

(3) Connected-in project investment subsidy policy Uniform subsidies are provided for new energy and grid connection project of distributed generation units to reduce the cost of connecting new energy into grid. Transmission subsidies are 0.01 Yuan/kW within 50 km, 2 cents2 /kW in 50100 km, 3 cents/kW over 100 km [12]. Projects connected into the transmission grid should be invested and constructed by grids enterprises, while projects connected into distribution grids should be invested and constructed by grids enterprises or generation enterprises.

2.3.5. Other policies China government also provided support in tax and ﬁnancial policy. In terms of comprehensive utilization of resources and wind power, value-added tax is the returned immediately as it is collected. Biomass power generation should be included in the total revenue by 90%; enterprise income tax of wind power, ocean energy power, solar power, geothermal power enterprises from the beginning of establishment is issued “three avoid three halve” [40], which means enterprise income tax is avoided in ﬁrst three years and halved from the fourth year to the sixth. And the annual loan discount rate of renewable energy should be below 3% in the ﬁrst three years [41].

3. Discussion and analysis

3.1. Characteristics of China’s electric power market China’s electric power system reform has followed the steps of general reform, aiming at ending the monopoly by introducing more competition to improve efﬁciency, reduce the operation cost and therefore achieving a sound power pricing mechanic, a better allocation of related resources and benign development of electric power industry. China’s electric power market has revealed some unique characteristics in this course (Fig. 12).

Characteristic 1: China’s electric power market is generationside electricity market. The current reform of China’s electric power market is separating the power plants from electric grid which were both owned by pre-reform power grid corporation to create normalized generating entity with independent legal status, and make the market only accessible for generation side at present [42]; generation enterprises and power grid corporations are market subjects independent from each other; power grid corporations direct the competition between each generation enterprise and receive supervision from the government. Characteristic 2: Single purchaser model. The current model of generation-side electricity market in China is focused on single purchaser, namely independent generation enterprises who competed against each other provide power to power grid corporations, which means individual consumers cannot sign purchasing contracts with the plants and have no choice other than getting power supply from power grid corporations either through resale or wholesale [43]. Power grid corporations will sign a number of long-term contracts to prevent under-supply or overprice. At present, some major consumers have begun to sign power purchase contracts with independent generation enterprises and therefore they just need to pay a small toll to the power grid corporations.

Characteristics 3: Incomplete electricity price bidding. China’s electricity price bidding has been incomplete so far [44], with most of the power supply is priced according to contracts. Noting that the power supply by contractions are handled in two different ways, on one hand, the supply must be on top priority before the part decided by market bidding; on the other hand, all the power supply is available to market competition, however the power supply by contractions should be rebated in clearing.

3.2. DG mode in China

3.2.1. Advantages of DG According to the characteristics of China’s electricity market and energy resources, distributed generation mode has many advantages: ﬁrst of all, it is able to make full use of the distributed renewable energy and promotes the development and use of China’s renewable energy. Second, this mode can make the distance between generation centers and power load centers or consumers shorter in the vast territory of China, reducing the risks of wires weariness and instability caused by long distance delivery

[45]. Third, medium, small or even micro-sized generator units are major types used in the DG mode which is easy to shut & start and operate. Furthermore, as its name suggested, the independence of each power plant reduces the probability of major power-off accidents signiﬁcantly and supports the reliability of power delivery in local grid, making the DG mode an important supplement to China’s centralized generation mode.

3.2.2. Existing problems of DG However, DG mode also has difﬁculties to deal with in terms of application in China. First, China’s primary electric grid mode is regional major grid construction due to the vast territory of China. The integration of DG mode into such grid will have fundamental impacts on the voltage [46], load-ﬂow [47], power loss in grid [48] and power dispatching [49] and create more complicated technical and managerial issues. Second, the electric power market mode and trade mode should be adjusted due to the change in market structure of electric power [50] (Fig. 13) after the DG mode connected into the main grid. In addition, the power quality will be directly inﬂuenced by the violability and uncertainty of new energy such as wind, solar which can be easily inﬂuenced by season and climate [51,52].

3.2.3. Improvement measures In such cases, China’s DG mode could be promoted in several aspects. First, it’s proposed DG handed over to agent operators to provide professional and intense management. Agent operators can synchronize several types of DG and reduce the instability caused by single DG mode. They can also realize the inclusion of DG in the electric market trade (Fig. 14), covering the maintenance cost through sharing the generation beneﬁts [53]. Second, DG mode could be further improved in collaboration with the building of China Intelligent Electric Grid after its integration to the main grid. For example, the application of virtual power plant technology (VPP) [54,55] in the intelligent grid is able to boost the market penetration rate of DG power and promote DG power to take part in electric trade and interact with the demand side to increase the effectiveness of management and effectively integrate the DG power into current electric system.

3.3. EP mode in China

3.3.1. Overview of EP in China China’s Zhejiang Electric Power Corporation and northeast area have experimented with EP mode. To implement the model, Zhejiang Province established simulated electric power market and settlement center for the power grid to make buy-in from power plants and sell-out to electric companies possible. As a reform pilot area, the northeast China has applied the mode of annually and monthly public bidding and trade in regional electric districts in which the electric power has two prices, namely capacity price determined by governments and market clearing price determined by bidding, with the bidding price as the price for electric power delivered through grid.

3.3.2. Existing problems of EP The pilot for EP mode enhanced the competition and market awareness among electric grid; however, it has also revealed that EP mode didn’t match what China needed in some aspects. First, the EP mode applied by China is focused more on internal management (competition exists only in individual electric companies or between different districts) and is hard to establishing a “fair, impartial and public” price system through complete competition as a result of negative side of history legacy (such as subsidies and discounts towards old plants). Second, China’s EP mode faces a big market risk of large amount of increased power purchase cost due to the large amount of purchase even though the price volatility may be small. China’s electric market is undergoing a process of development and formation with a lack of repeated process of gaming. 3.3.3. Improvement measures The development path of new energy will undergo such a process: governmental subsidies-company-level proﬁtabilityenhanced size-scale economy-reduce cost-free market [56]. Therefore, the new electric power repository mode that matches the actual needs and situation of China could be designed in several dimensions. First, EP mode should be applied in plausible and feasible areas. For example, boundaries between China’s various regional electric corporations or provincial grid should be eradicated; EP mode should be applied in areas with abundant and well-developed renewable energy to promote reasonable competition and reduce systematic unfairness. Second, a certain quota should be reserved and allocated to new energy power to connect the grid on the basis that the power gird is in operation. Such policies as reserved quota and price subsidies could reduce the inﬂuence of negative side of history legacy on fair competition and promote the connecting of energy power to the grid.

3.4. Integrated mode: BMA mode

According to our analysis above, DG is a style of energy utilization; EP is an electric power market model. An appropriate market model will promote energy utilization. Therefore, in this paper make an integration of two concepts from different ﬁeld: EP and DG, construct a Base–Market–Assist (BMA) mode composed by Base part, Market part and Assist part (Fig. 15), to focus distributed generation units under electricity pool market mode in China. EP is regional and mandatory. It can alleviate the DG’s problems such as imbalance, instability and high cost effectively. Therefore, this paper may provide a new idea for the improvement of China’s renewable energy development.

3.4.1. Base part The renewable energy is scattered, so in the Base part, we focus on how to make full use of scattered renewable energy. First, we should create partition according to resources priority. Second, all the distributed generation units in each partition should be managed by one single agency operator, which is ﬁt for making

a uniform management. The uniform management consists of resource evaluation, resource use, generator sets construction and management, power bidding, etc. Although the distributed power units are inﬂuenced by the external environment greatly, the wind power and solar power would realize the supply effect of Wind–PV hybrid generation by the uniform management. In addition, combined application of gas-ﬁred generation, biomass power generation, small hydro and other distributed power can also effectively avoid large ﬂuctuations of distributed generation. The recommendations above provide a basis for application of EP.

3.4.2. Market part In the Base part, all the distributed generation units should be managed by one single agency operator in their area. It can synchronize several types of DG and reduce the instability caused by single DG mode, and also can realize the inclusion of DG in the electric market trade. After that, EP mode based market transaction mode is designed in the Market part. Agent operator of distributed generation units do price bidding with the conventional power suppliers according to the trade regulation of the Pool. The trade mainly includes contractual dealing, day-ahead trading and real-time trade [53].

(1) Contractual dealing As a crucial part in the power market of China, stable power contract market is an important trading platform for lowering the risks of market players and ensuring the long-term safe operation of electric power system. On the contract market, all kinds of generators, including the distributed generation agent operators, summit contract volume and contract price to trade center and enter the contract market through bilateral consultation and competitive auction. Through negotiations on both sides, generators or generation agent operators and the grid enterprises or users directly reach an agreement on medium and long term or short term contract, and determine the contract power quantity (Pb0 ) and contract price (Rb0 ); under the way of bidding auction, the generators or generation agent operators summit the contract volume and contract price in certain times of the future. According to the principle of minimum total electricity purchasing cost and without blocking the system, the trade center determine the contract trading power (Pb1 ) and the price (Rb1 ).

(2) Day-ahead trading The day-ahead market is the key link of contract market and realtime market, effectively regulating the imbalance between supply and demand in contract market. In day-ahead market, all kinds of generators and generation agent operators can determine the bidding electricity volume (PDG,I ; PG,j ) and price (SDG,i ; S G, j ) according to the predict power the other day (Pad ) published by the trade center and its contract volume. The trade center determines the market cleaning price (Sad ) and output size and orders of other generators according to the volume and price summited by the generators, and simultaneously make explicit the compliment mechanism for generators when insufﬁcient demand happens the next day.

(3) Real-time trade The real-time trade is a short-term balanced market conducted by the electricity market operation department in order to ensure supply and demand balance, maintain system stability, make real time modiﬁcation for generation plan, and release real-time operation instruction. With the increase of distributed generation grid-connected capacity, the distributed generation is expected to play an important role in realtime market with the characteristic of ﬂexibility, near the load center and low start-up cost.

The real-time market runs after the closing and before the reopening of day-ahead market. All generators summit the upper and lower adjustable capacity unit and its offer (PDG,rti , SDG,rtj ; PG,rti , SG,rtj ) in real-time trading. Then the trade center overall consider the demand of the market, contract volume and real-time trade volume to modulate the plan and to determine the best adjusting schemes, including the realtime trading volume and the market clearing price (Prt , Srt ). The real-time trade is an important means to guarantee the power supply and demand balance. When there is a larger ﬂuctuation in the real-time power demand, distributed generation located in the distribution grid side can use its ﬂexibility to regulate the impact ﬂuctuation in demand on the electric market, realizing peak-valley shift on the supply side. Distributed generation, especially for its stable output, can easily realize its start-stop advantage with its ﬂexibility and low-cost.

At the same time, from the perspective of distributed generators, formulating a more reasonable electricity price of peak load can improve the market competitiveness while from the perspective of market regulator, it is necessary to complete the corresponding regulation of distributed generation grid connection and make explicit the compensation and incentive mechanism for participators in the peak shaving of distributed power supply, ultimately to encourage distributed generation actively participate in the supply and demand adjustment in real-time market. Therefore, the assist part is required.

3.4.3. Assist part To contribute to the development of renewable energy by a fully using of EP mode, Chinese government needs to provide policy support, such as, restrict the on-grid energy proportion of distributed generation in the contract market, determine the reserve capacity of its general generation reasonably, provide proper feed-in tariff for distributed power supply (wind power, photovoltaic power generation, etc.) which largely depends on external conditions and has a relatively high generating cost, or

provide subsidy to distributed power producers for costs of energy storage devices, etc. Meanwhile, it is necessary to keep the advancement of technology by developing the new types of power converters or energy storage technology, analyzing the operation mode and stability of power grid, etc. [57]. Mechanisms above together form the assist part of BMA mode.

4. Conclusions and prospects

4.1. Conclusions

First, the paper combs the current developing situation and prospect of China’s energy, indicating that the course of renewable energy generation is speeding up. In the meantime, Chinese energy policy and prospect have created a sound environment for the renewable energy generation course. Renewable energy development in China has broad prospects.

Second, compared to centralized generator, distributed generator has ﬂexible scale and short construction cycle. In addition, it can effectively absorb distributed renewable energy and improve the reliability of local power grid. Meanwhile, distributed generation is close to load center, which reduces the line loss and instability. Distributed generation is an important supplement to centralized generation.

Third, to promote the scale development of distributed generators, the mode of “reasonable partitions based on renewable energy resource endowments” and “performing a centralized operational management to distributed generators by using agent operators” can be used.

Fourth, the Pool can adapt to the traits of regional distribution of China’s renewable energy, and pull various forms of renewable energy generation into a competitive market. Besides, it can ensure reasonable competition through the auxiliary means for the long-term development of distributed generation.

Fifth, taking views above, BMA mode puts forward the operating and trading patterns of distributed generators under complete Pool mode, which improves the application value of those views.

4.2. Prospects

BMA mode provides a new method for Chinese renewable energy development by combining energy, policy, power generation systems, market model and other various contents. However compared to developed countries, China’s renewable energy industry is not mature. There are still a lot of things to do in market design, mechanism arrangement and other aspects to ensure the fairness and stability of the electric power market.

First, China ought to formulate a scientiﬁc and reasonable longterm development plan for renewable energy, through the stages of the completion of objectives, to promote long-term development.

Second, China’s relevant government departments must pay enough attention to much-needed work. In especial, preferential policies and the detailed rules in line with the characteristics of renewable energy in China should be published as soon as possible.

Third, China must strengthen scientiﬁc and technological innovations, enhance core competitiveness, providing a strong impetus for the development of renewable energy."
12,Does electricity price matter for innovation in renewable energy technologies in China?,"Though the development of renewable energy is rapid, innovation in renewable energy technologies is relatively weak due to the late commencement of renewable energy in China. In addition, renewable energy is mainly introduced into the supply mix of electricity generation, which increases the costs of electricity generation. Higher electricity price will make renewable energy more competitive and call forth renewable energy technological innovation. Based on FMOLS and DOLS models, as well as PMG model, this paper investigates the induced long and short run effects of electricity price, funding support, and economic growth on innovation in renewable energy technologies at the provincial level in China during the period 2006–2016. The Conclusions drawn were: (1) R&D expenditure and economic growth have positive impacts on innovation in renewable energy technologies in the long and short run; (2) Electricity price only has a long run effect on patenting in renewable energy technologies; (3) In the long run, a 1% increase in electricity price can lead to a 0.7825%–1.0952% increase in the patent counts of renewable energy technologies; (4) Electricity pricing system in China does not play any role in driving renewable energy technological innovation in the short run.","1. Introduction

The role of renewable energy in global climate change mitigation and energy supply security has been widely recognized. In recent years, the renewable energy industry in China has developed rapidly. This is reﬂected in two aspects: (1) The scale of renewable energy market has rapidly expanded, as the newly installed capacity of wind energy and solar photovoltaic energy in China ranked ﬁrst globally in 2017, and renewable power generation is expected to rank ﬁrst in the world; (2) China's renewable energy investment in 2017 reached 126.6 billion dollar, and accounted for 45% of global green energy investment.

Broadly deﬁned, renewable energy includes wind energy, solar energy, biomass and waste energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, and hydro energy. Due to the matured development stage of hydroelectricity, the growth rate of hydroelectricity will not be very signiﬁcant in the future (Lin and Chen, 2018). In China, the scale of development of wind energy, solar energy, biomass and waste energy, geothermal energy and ocean energy will still be expanded to realize the target of emission reduction and increase the share of renewable energy in total energy use. Moreover, the cost of hydroelectricity is closed to that of thermal power, while wind energy, solar energy, biomass and waste energy, geothermal energy and ocean energy need a very large signiﬁcant amount of renewable energy subsidies from the government due to their higher costs. Therefore, renewable energy in this paper includes only wind energy, solar energy, biomass and waste energy, geothermal energy and ocean energy.

Though the development of renewable energy is rapid, innovation in renewable energy technologies is relatively weak due to the late commencement of renewable energy in China. However, renewable energy technology innovation is the key to the development of renewable energy. Patent counts and patent stock are generally used to measure the outcome of technological development process, which provides a valuable source of information on the nature of the invention and reﬂects the innovative performance (Griliches, 1990; Archibugi and Pianta, 1996; Lindman and Söderholm, 2016; Li and Lin, 2016; Lam et al., 2017; Schleicha et al., 2017; Böhringer et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; Lach, 1995; Park and Park, 2006; Grafström and Lindman, 2017; Kim et al., 2018). Hence, patent counts are the most important indicator of technological innovation and are widely used to proxy technological innovation in many studies. Compared with inputs of technological innovation, patent counts as an outcome are more direct, and are strongly correlated with R&D spending (Griliches, 1990). Though not all invention is patented, there are very few signiﬁcant inventions without patenting (Johnstone et al., 2010), which also indicates that patent counts can better reﬂect the technological innovation performance. There are also two advantages of adopting patent counts and patent stock to proxy innovation in renewable energy technologies. One is that patent counts and patent stock are related to invention and also can be disaggregated into speciﬁc technological areas, and the other is that the data on the number of patent counts are available and patent stock is easily calculated from patent counts (Lindman and Söderholm, 2016; Park and Park, 2006; Cohen et al., 2017). In summary, patent counts and patent stock are good proxies for innovative activities. In general, the patent counts in renewable energy technologies are collected according to the International Patent Classiﬁcation (IPC) codes of each kind of renewable energy technologies, following the studies of Popp et al. (2011), Johnstone et al. (2010) and Noailly and Shestalova (2017). Therefore, based on this definition, the IPC codes of each kind of renewable energy technologies are shown in Appendix A, Table A. Before the renewable energy industry entered the stage of large-scale commercialization, patent counts of renewable energy were at a low level mainly because renewable energy in China started late and lacked the core technologies. In 2005, the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC) issued the Guiding Catalogue on Renewable Energy Development, which, to a certain extent, increased the patent counts of renewable energy technologies.

From Fig. 1, all provinces in China have patent counts of renewable energy technologies, and the patent counts concentrate on wind energy and solar energy. However, there are great differences in patent counts among provinces. As shown in Fig. 1, the patent counts are concentrated mostly in coastal developed areas. The advantages of intensive technology and labor in the coastal developed areas, such as Jiangsu, Beijing, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and Shanghai, facilitates more patent counts. These coastal developed areas have more energy enterprises, research institutions, colleges and universities and research and development personnel, which also require effective investment in R&D activities to drive innovation (Li and Lin, 2016). In addition, these coastal developed areas with a high level of economic development have the abilities to pay more for renewable energy technologies to improve environmental quality and increase electricity demand. Therefore, a higher level of economic growth has induced effect on innovation.

Though many studies focus on the role of energy price in technological innovation, the impact of electricity price on innovation in renewable energy technologies would be discussed in this paper. Firstly, renewable energy is mainly introduced into the supply mix of electricity generation, which may increase the costs of electricity generation. A relatively effective electricity pricing system should consider the increasing costs and keep a reasonable increase in electricity price.

Higher electricity price will make renewable energy more competitive and call forth innovation in renewable energy technologies to reduce costs of electricity generation. Secondly, energy price mainly contains fossil fuel price. However, fossil fuel price can affect the diffusion of renewable energy technologies which has taken place after the innovation (Grafström and Lindman, 2017). Unlike energy price, electricity price has a direct induced effect on innovation in renewable energy technologies. Besides, the development of renewable energy technologies relying on government subsidies is not a long-term and effective measure, and subsidy policies will be eventually canceled. Whether electricity price can accurately reﬂect the cost of electricity generation and market value would impact the renewable energy technological innovation. Thus, this paper argues that there is induced effect of electricity price on patent counts of renewable energy technologies. Some researchers indicate that an increase in electricity price will drive innovation of renewable energy technologies (Johnstone et al., 2010; Nicolli and Vona, 2016; Schleicha et al., 2017). Others ﬁnd that lower electricity price enhances renewable energy technologies (He et al., 2018). Is China's electricity pricing system effectively and signiﬁcantly conducive for innovation in renewable energy technologies? Is there a long run equilibrium relationship between electricity price and renewable energy technological innovation? Although this paper concentrates on the effect of electricity prices on innovation in renewable energy technologies, this paper also seeks to answer the question: What factors inﬂuence innovative activity?

Following the above, this paper investigates the long run and short run effects of electricity price, funding support, and economic environment on innovation in renewable energy technologies at the provincial level in China. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 brieﬂy reviews existing research. In Section 3, the data used are described, and the estimation methods are introduced. Section 4 presents the results and discussion. The last section presents the conclusions and some policy suggestions.

2. Literature review

Regarding the relationship between energy price and innovation, there is “induced effect” of increasing energy price on innovation (Popp, 2002). An increase in energy prices (calculated by electricity price, light fuel price, and natural gas price) may stimulate green knowledge stock and establish a clean-tech market (Ley et al., 2013). Increasing oil prices can also reinforce existing innovation systems (Cheon and Urpelainen, 2012). Using the Poisson model, Kruse and Wetzel (2016) found that energy prices had a positive impact on innovation for solar energy and ocean energy technologies. Higher electricity price may also have positive “induced effect” on innovation in renewable energy technologies because renewable energy is generally used to generate power and is simultaneously sold with thermal power. However, the costs of electricity generation from renewable energy are greater than from thermal power (Johnstone et al., 2010). Higher electricity price is conducive for the introduction of renewable energy into the supply mix (Biresselioglu et al., 2016), which reﬂects more demand for renewable energy and call forth innovation in renewable energy technologies. Therefore, a reasonable increase in electricity price can make renewable energy more competitive and can promote renewable energy technologies (Ouyang and Lin, 2014). In addition, increasing electricity price will signal a higher proﬁt in the future, which will drive innovation of renewable energy technologies (Johnstone et al., 2010; Schleicha et al., 2017). Increasing electricity price has become an important approach to improve electricity generation efﬁciency (Lin and Liu, 2013), including renewable energy electricity generation efﬁciency. However, Li and Lin (2016), using panel cointegration and VEC model, proved that energy price was not a signiﬁcant determinant of energy technology. In other words, China's energy price system impedes innovation in energy technology. Additionally, He et al. (2018) applied the dynamic panel model and found that lower electricity price enhances renewable energy technologies. The above studies reach different conclusions on the impact of electricity price on innovation, and hence, it requires further study. Some researchers use households and industrial end-use price as a proxy for electricity price (Johnstone et al., 2010; Nicolli and Vona, 2016; He et al., 2018), while others use electricity prices for households (Schleicha et al., 2017). In China, the growth of residential electricity is fast in recent years, and the contribution of residential electricity to the electricity consumption of the whole society continues to increase. Additionally, the data on electricity prices for households including surcharges for renewable energy and other governmental projects, which can still capture the induced effect on innovation in renewable energy technologies and reﬂect investment incentives for renewable energy manufacturers (Schleicha et al., 2017). To some extent, the data on electricity prices for households take account of the renewable energy generation costs. Hence, this paper adopts electricity prices for households (EP) as a proxy for electricity prices.

With respect to the impact of funding support, Popp et al. (2011) and Johnstone et al. (2012) investigated that R&D expenditure is very important for innovation in renewable energy technologies. Johnstone et al. (2010), Nicolli and Vona (2016), Lindman and Söderholm (2016) and Schleicha et al. (2017) used negative binomial ﬁxed effect model and found that R&D investment has an induced effect on innovation in certain renewable energy technologies, especially wind energy and solar energy. However, many studies like Böhringer et al. (2017) and Grafström and Lindman (2017) also illustrated that investment in R&D activities did not have a signiﬁcant impact on innovation in renewable energy technologies at the matured phase while public R&D spending played a positive role in renewable energy technologies at the early and large-scale development stages. This result suggests that the Chinese government should focus on making efﬁcient use of R&D spending to promote innovation in renewable energy technologies. However, it is hard to obtain data on investment in renewable energy R&D activities at the provincial level in China. Li and Lin (2016) showed that the trend of energy R&D spending was consistent with that of R&D expenditure. The trend of funding for R&D of renewable energy is also consistent with that of investment in R&D activities. Therefore, this paper uses China's investment on R&D activities (RD) as a proxy for funding support because R&D support is the most representative impetus encouraging patenting in renewable energy technologies. The data has been deﬂated by consumer price index (CPI) (2006 = 1).

Similar to funding support, economic growth plays a positive role in stimulating patenting in renewable energy technologies. Firstly, economic growth shows the willingness to pay for renewable energy technologies, in order to improve environmental quality (Diekmann and Franzen, 1999), and can overcome the higher costs of renewable energy and the costs related with the innovation in renewable energy

technologies (Chang et al., 2009). Secondly, economic growth has an important effect on increase in electricity consumption (Narayan and Smyth, 2008; Tang and Tan, 2013; Zhao et al., 2016), which shows that higher demand for electricity will have market size effect (Nicolli and Vona, 2016) and ultimately call forth and trigger innovation (He et al., 2018). Thirdly, the provinces with a higher level of economic development have more research institutions, colleges, and universities, and attract more research and development personnel (Xu and Lin, 2018). Many studies also prove that economic growth is a driving force of innovation (Nicolli and Vona, 2016; Li and Lin, 2016). Therefore, regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is used as a proxy for economic growth in this paper. It has been deﬂated by an indicator of Gross Domestic Product (2006 = 1).

The existing literature has some limitations: Firstly, most studies consider the effects of energy price, R&D funding and economic growth on innovation in renewable energy technologies using negative binomial ﬁxed effect model, Poisson model or dynamic GMM model at the cross-country level. Few studies analyze the long run and short run effects of energy price, R&D expenditure and economic growth on innovation in renewable energy technologies at the provincial level in China. Secondly, most studies pay attention to energy price, but not electricity price. However, renewable energy is mainly introduced into the supply mix of electricity generation. Additionally, energy price mainly contains fossil fuel price. However, fossil fuel price can affect the diffusion of renewable energy technologies which has taken place after the innovation (Grafström and Lindman, 2017). Unlike energy price, electricity price has a direct induced effect on innovation in renewable energy technologies. Besides, the development of renewable energy technologies relying on government subsidies is not a long-term and effective measure, and subsidy policies will be eventually canceled. Whether electricity price can accurately reﬂect the cost of electricity generation and market value would impact the renewable energy technological innovation. Therefore, whether there is an induced effect of electricity price on patent counts of renewable energy technologies is a very interesting issue. Thirdly, few studies analyze that electricity price plays a role in renewable energy technological innovation from the perspective of long run effect and short run dynamics. There is also a controversy on the positive or negative impact of electricity price on innovation in renewable energy technologies. Thus, this study is of great signiﬁcance to the literature and policy discussions. This paper can provide targeted policy suggestions according to the conclusions of our study.

3. Data and methods

3.1. Data sources and description

The data on electricity prices for households are available during the period from 2006 to 2016. Due to the minimal share of patent counts in Qinghai, Hainan, and Tibet, these provinces are excluded from the analysis. The data on electricity prices for households in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are not available. Therefore, the provincial data applied in the study are from 2006 to 2016, which includes only 28 provinces (excluding Qinghai, Hainan, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) in China.

To check the robustness of the estimates, patent counts of renewable energy technologies are substituted with patent counts of wind energy technologies (WPC), solar energy technologies (SPC), and patent stock of renewable energy technologies (NPS). Besides, R&D funding and regional GDP have been further substituted with R&D intensity (RDI) and electricity consumption (EC).

The patent counts of renewable energy technologies, wind energy technologies and solar energy technologies are available in the Chinese Patent Online Databases published by China's State Intellectual Property Ofﬁce (SIPO). The patent stock of renewable energy technologies is calculated from the patent counts of renewable energy technologies. The data on investment in R&D activities, R&D intensity and electricity prices for households are obtained from WIND. The data on regional GDP and electricity consumption for the period 2006 to 2016 are collected from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The detailed description of the variables is shown in Table 1.

A panel sample data of 28 provinces in China from 2006 to 2016 was used in this paper. In our estimations, all the variables, except R&D intensity, are in natural logarithm in order to make the data stable. The summary statistics of the variables are shown in Table 2.

3.2. Model speciﬁcations

In order to investigate the roles of electricity price in innovation in renewable energy technologies, China's provincial data from 2006 to 2016 are used. The relationships and impacts of funding support and economic growth on patenting in renewable energy technologies are also analyzed. The model constructed for the study is shown below:

ln NPC it ¼ β 0 þ β 1 ln EP it þ β 2 ln RD it þ β 3 ln GDP it þ εit 

ð1Þ

In Eq. (1), NPC represents patent counts of renewable energy technologies. EP is electricity price of households, and RD denotes R&D expenditure as a proxy for funding support. GDP is regional Gross Domestic Product as a proxy for economic growth. In Eq. (1), i = 1, ⋯⋯, 28 indexes the 28 provinces in China, and t = 2006, ⋯⋯, 2016 indexes time. ε it denotes the error term.

Due to the induced effect of electricity price on innovation in renewable energy technologies, a rational increase in electricity price can promote patenting in renewable energy technologies. However, improved renewable energy technologies may reduce power generation cost, which may result in lower electricity price and an increase in electricity consumption. Additionally, R&D funding stimulates innovation. At the same time, development of renewable energy technologies may also attract R&D investment. Therefore, there are biases in estimating the relationships. Moreover, when the variables are cointegrated, the traditional regression models, such as pooled OLS, ﬁxed effect model and dynamic panel model, are biased and produce inconsistent estimates. To estimate long run effects of electricity price, R&D expenditure and regional GDP on innovation in renewable energy technologies, the dynamic OLS (DOLS) and the fully-modiﬁed OLS (FMOLS) (Phillips and Hansen, 1990; Saikkonen, 1991; Phillips and Moon, 1999) are applied. DOLS is a parametric method, while FMOLS is a nonparametric method (Lin and Omoju, 2017). However, the FMOLS are more appropriate for the short panel data. Thus, this paper mainly pays attention to the results of the FMOLS model. Next, the short run coefﬁcients between electricity price and innovation in renewable energy technologies are estimated by panel ECM. Mean-group (MG), dynamic ﬁxed-effect (DFE) and pooled meangroup (PMG) estimators can be used to analyze short run dynamics. DFE allows constant short-run and long-run slope parameters, while MG permits the slope parameters to change in the short run and long run (Salim et al., 2017). PMG assumes the slope parameters to vary in the short run but imposes homogenous slope parameters across all cross-sectional units in the long run (Pesaran et al., 1999). According to the results of joint Hausman test, the PMG estimator is more suitable for our study.

4. Empirical results and discussion

4.1. Results of unit root tests and panel cointegration tests

Before estimating the long run effects and short run dynamics, our paper uses panel unit root test to determine the order of integration of the variables. In this paper, the three widely used tests to examine the stationarity of the variables are applied. These tests include the IPS test (Im et al., 2003), Fisher-ADF and Fisher-PP (Choi, 2001). Compared with the IPS test, the Fisher-ADF and Fisher-PP tests can adopt various lag lengths for the individual and are used for unbalanced panel data (Li and Lin, 2016). The results of the unit root test which consider the situation of intercept and trend are reported in Table 3. At level, all the variables except WPC and EP are nonstationary because the statistics of IPS, Fisher-ADF and Fisher-PP are insigniﬁcant. At ﬁrst difference, all the variables are signiﬁcant at 1%, 5% or 10% level, which shows that all the variables are stationary.

The Pedroni and Kao cointegration tests can examine the existence of long run effects. All variables need to be of the same order before doing cointegration tests (Lin et al., 2012). Due to the stationarity of all variable at ﬁrst difference as shown in Table 3, this paper further applies the Pedroni and Kao cointegration tests to examine the existence of long run effects of electricity price, R&D funding and regional GDP on innovation in renewable energy technologies. The results of the Pedroni and Kao cointegration tests are presented in Table 4. Due to the signiﬁcant statistics of the panel PP, panel ADF, group PP, and group ADF, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected. In addition, according to the signiﬁcant statistics of the ADF, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is also rejected. Hence, the results of the two cointegration tests prove the existence of long run effects. 4.2. Results of long run effect and short run dynamics

This paper uses FMOLS and DOLS models to estimate the long run effects of electricity price, R&D funding and regional GDP on innovation in renewable energy technologies. The results of the FMOLS and DOLS models are shown in Table 5. The time lag in the long run models equals to 1 according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which is in lines with many studies, such as Schleicha et al. (2017) and Böhringer et al. (2017).

First, there is a signiﬁcant positive correlation between electricity price and innovation in renewable energy technologies in both the FMOLS and DOLS models. Speciﬁcally, a 1% increase in electricity price can raise the patent counts of renewable energy technologies by 0.7825% and 1.0952% according to the FMOLS and DOLS models respectively. Moreover, higher electricity price can make renewable energy more competitive, and can introduce renewable energy technologies into the supply mix (He et al., 2018). In addition, an increase in the electricity price will also signal a higher future proﬁt, which can also increase incentives for innovation and secure more proﬁts for renewable energy manufacturers (Johnstone et al., 2010). In China, renewable energy technologies require incentives from electricity price due to relatively higher cost. Regarding funding support, the coefﬁcients for R&D expenditure are positive and signiﬁcant at 1% level in both models. Speciﬁcally, a 1% increase in R&D expenditure leads to 1.0093%–1.1813% increase in patent counts in renewable energy technologies. These results are in line with Li and Lin (2016) and Sung (2015). R&D funding plays an important role in promoting innovation in renewable energy technologies (Costantini et al., 2015; Nicolli and Vona, 2016; Schleicha et al., 2017). Though government's R&D support is most effective in the short and medium term (Guan and Yam, 2015; Wang et al., 2012), renewable energy technologies have long run development cycles with learning disadvantage (Plank and Doblinger, 2018; Bointner, 2014; Kahouli-Brahmi, 2009), which requires more investment in R&D activities from government and enterprises to innovation in renewable energy technologies in the long run.

Regional GDP has a signiﬁcant and positive impact on patenting in renewable energy technologies in both models. Speciﬁcally, a 1% increase in regional GDP can raise the innovation in renewable energy technologies by 2.1611% and 0.5713% respectively according to the FMOLS and DOLS models. The results are similar to the results of Li and Lin (2016) and Sung (2015). This implies that higher economic growth will expand the electricity market size and consumption (Lewis and Wiser, 2007; Sawhney and Kahn, 2012), and sustaining economic growth will stimulate renewable energy technologies. Next, this paper estimates the short run dynamics via PMG model presented in Table 5. There is no time lag in the short-term model, which is consistent with Li and Lin (2016) and Salim et al. (2017). The coefﬁcient of ecm (−0.6412) is negative and signiﬁcant at 1% level, which indicates that there is panel cointegration relationship in the short run. It implies that the deviation from the cointegration system of renewable energy technologies patent counts will change about −64.12% in the next term. Electricity price has an insigniﬁcant relationship with patent counts of renewable energy technologies in the short run, indicating that electricity pricing system does not play a role in driving the innovation in renewable energy technologies. Due to substantial electricity subsidies, electricity prices for households in China are controlled at a low level by the government (Wang and Lin, 2017). Artiﬁcially lowering the electricity prices for households cannot truly reﬂect the market value, which will hinder the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies, especially for solar energy technologies. Under the current electricity pricing system, high-income groups do not have to increase their expenditure signiﬁcantly for their excessive consumption (Du et al., 2015b). However, high-income groups are generally willing to pay more for renewable energy technologies. Therefore, the increasing costs of electricity generation due to the renewable energy introduced are not well taken into account at the low level of electricity prices and are not reasonably apportioned to residents of different income levels. Additionally, the reform process of electricity pricing system in China is too slow to effectively deal with above problems, which indicates that electricity pricing system in China does not have any effect on renewable energy technologies innovation in the short run. Nonetheless, the coefﬁcients of R&D expenditure and economic growth are signiﬁcantly positive at 1% level, which shows that R&D expenditure and economic growth drive the innovation in renewable energy technologies in the short run. In summary, these conclusions imply that R&D expenditure and economic growth have long run effects and short run dynamics on innovation in renewable energy technologies. Electricity price only has a long run effect on patenting in renewable energy technologies. Though government would consider generation costs when setting and adjusting electricity price, the electricity price cannot play any role in promoting renewable energy technological innovation in the short run due to the unreasonable cross-subsidies, slow electricity pricing reform and artiﬁcially regulation bringing the distortion of market value. However, the long-run adjustment of electricity price has a positive effect on patent counts of renewable energy technologies. In other words, there are positively induced effects of electricity price, R&D funding and economic growth on innovation in the long run.

4.3. Robustness checks

To check the robustness of the results in Section 4.2, this paper tests a series of different classiﬁcations of variables. First, patent stock of renewable energy technologies, patent counts of wind energy technologies and solar energy technologies are used as explained variables rather than patent counts of renewable energy technologies. Wind energy and solar energy technologies are two main kinds of renewable energy technologies, and their installed capacities in China ranked ﬁrst globally. Moreover, Schleicha et al. (2017) illustrated that patent stock might further adequately reﬂect sector-speciﬁc effect such as technology suppliers' learning-by-inventing. Hence, this section discusses the induced effects of electricity price, R&D funding and economic growth on patent stock of renewable energy technologies, patent counts of wind energy technologies and solar energy technologies. This paper refers to the formula of Kim et al. (2018) to calculate patent stock of renewable energy technologies as shown below:

The patent data at the provincial level in China is reported from 1985. Thus, the initial value of patent stock is determined by the value of patent count in 1985. The depreciation rate (δ) is 15%.

As shown in Table 6, the results are similar to those in Table 5. The coefﬁcients of electricity price, R&D funding, and economic growth are all signiﬁcantly positive in the long run. Speciﬁcally, a 1% increase in electricity price leads to a 0.9231%–1.2508% increase in the number of patent counts in wind energy technologies and a 0.8030%–1.2829% increase in the number of patent counts in solar energy technologies, respectively. Similarly, a 1% increase in electricity price can raise the patent stock of renewable energy technologies by 0.6224% according to the FMOLS model. Given that the coefﬁcients of ecm in Table 6 are negative and signiﬁcant at 1% level, there is a cointegration relationship in the short run. The coefﬁcients of R&D funding and economic growth have a signiﬁcant positive impact on the patent stock of renewable energy technologies, patent counts of wind energy technologies and solar energy technologies in the short run. However, the coefﬁcients of electricity price are insigniﬁcant in the short run. These results prove again that electricity pricing system in China does not play any role in driving the innovation in renewable energy technologies in the short run.

In addition, since R&D intensity is appropriate to reﬂect different regions with signiﬁcantly different scientiﬁc resources and capacity (He et al., 2018), R&D intensity is substituted for R&D expenditure in this section. Many studies ﬁnd that economic growth and electricity consumption have the same variation trend (Yuan et al., 2007; Narayan and Smyth, 2008; Tang and Tan, 2013; Zhao et al., 2016). Therefore, this paper also explores the effects of electricity price, R&D intensity and electricity consumption on innovation in renewable energy technologies. Table 7 indicates that electricity price, R&D intensity and electricity consumption have signiﬁcant positive impacts on patent counts and patent stock of renewable energy technologies in the long run. Besides, a 1% increase in electricity price leads to a 1.9128%–2.3550% increase in the patent counts of renewable energy technologies and a 0.8855%–2.1250% increase in the patent stock of renewable energy technologies, respectively. The coefﬁcients of other variables are positive and statistically signiﬁcant in the long run, which is in line with the results of Table 5. For the short run dynamics, the coefﬁcients of ecm in Table 7 are negative and signiﬁcant at 1% level, and the estimated results in the short run are consistent with Table 5. Thus, it implies that the effectiveness of electricity price system on innovation in renewable energy technologies should be improved in the short run.

Therefore, our ﬁndings are consistent and robust across a series of different classiﬁcation of variables.

5. Conclusion and policy implications

Based on a panel sample in 28 provinces in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper uses FMOLS and DOLS models and PMG model to investigate the long and short-term induced effects of electricity price, funding support and economic growth on innovation in renewable energy technologies. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) R&D expenditure and economic growth have positive impacts on innovation in renewable energy technologies in the long run and short run; (2) Electricity price only has a long run effect on patenting in renewable energy technologies;

(3) In the long run, a 1% increase in electricity price can lead to a 0.7825%–

1.0952% increase in patent counts of renewable energy technologies;

(4) Electricity pricing system in China does not play any role in driving the innovation in renewable energy technologies in the short run.

Though many methods, such as emission trading scheme and carbon tax, can reduce carbon emission (Lin and Jia, 2017; Lin and Jia, 2018), the increase of renewable energy in the supply mix also achieves emission reduction through reducing fossil fuel production. The Plan on the Revolution Strategies in Energy Production and Consumption (2016–2030) has stated the goal of increasing the ratio of non-fossil energy consumption in China to about 20% in 2030. Therefore, China's renewable energy industry will continue to expand. More so, innovation in renewable energy technologies has an obvious strategic signiﬁcance and is conducive for generation costs reduction and utilization efﬁciency of renewable energy. Based on the above analysis, this paper suggests that the Chinese government should focus on the reform of the electricity pricing system. Simultaneously, the government should make more efﬁcient use of funding support (e.g. R&D expenditure) and narrow the gap of economic growth level between developed regions and developing regions to promote innovation in renewable energy technologies in all regions.

Firstly, the efﬁcient electricity pricing system should be the marginal price of electricity equaling the marginal cost of generation and reasonably contain the environmental costs. The costs of electricity generation from renewable energy are greater than that of thermal power. Therefore, a higher electricity price is conducive for introducing renewable energy into the supply mix and improve the competitiveness of renewable energy power. Moreover, when electricity price is determined by the market, the cost gap between traditional thermal power and renewable energy power may be narrowed. At this time, the innovation of renewable energy technologies will be more needed to reduce costs. The development of renewable energy technologies relying on government subsidies is not a long-term and effective measure, and subsidy policies will be eventually canceled. Electricity price should accurately reﬂect the cost of electricity generation and market value in order to promote renewable energy technology innovation and gain the ability to compete with thermal power in the supply mix. In addition, the efﬁcient electricity pricing system can promote the development and utilization of renewable energy. Energy pricing reform is an effective way to control total energy consumption and also improve energy efﬁciency (Lin et al., 2017; Du et al., 2018), while electricity pricing reform is also an effective approach to reduce the rebound effect (Lin and Liu, 2013). Hence, electricity pricing reform is important for low-carbon economy and sustainable development (He et al., 2014). Increasing electricity price can enhance the awareness of energy conservation and the willingness to pay for renewable energy technologies (Sun and Lin, 2013), which foster rapid innovation in renewable energy technologies to achieve these targets. Besides, electricity price in China is ﬂat and relatively low, so it does not play any signiﬁcant role in stimulating innovation in renewable energy technologies in the short term. Due to unreasonable cross-subsidies, electricity prices for households are relatively low. Hence, cross-subsidies need to be reduced step by step and stage by stage until being abolished. Moreover, electricity price is relatively ﬂat, since the reform process of the electricity pricing system in China is relatively slow. The deep-rooted problem with electricity prices in China is that they are not allowed to adjust quickly enough (Liu et al., 2013). The government needs to accelerate the process of electricity price reform, but also needs to be careful not to haste without success. Thus, the government should build time-varying electricity pricing mechanism to timely respond to the renewable energy market. To carry out electricity pricing reform smoothly and to reduce the uncertainties, the establishment of early warning mechanism, the enactment of complementary policies and so on should be also implemented (Du et al., 2015a).

Finally, promoting R&D expenditure is conducive for innovation in renewable energy technologies in the long run and the short run. However, market failure such as insufﬁcient information makes the actual values of R&D spending uncertain and lower than the optimal level. Therefore, the funding in renewable energy technologies should be efﬁciently used. The cooperation between public and private sector stakeholders is conducive for sharing information and facilitating the technology transfer (Apergis and Payne, 2010). Additionally, the provinces with lower economic growth level should expand exchanges and cooperation with the provinces with higher economic growth level (Xu and Lin, 2018). Moreover, it is important to narrow the gap in economic growth level and maintain a sustainable economic development, which ultimately promotes the innovation in renewable energy technologies in all provinces. These provinces will be more willing to pay for renewable energy technologies."
13,Economic and carbon emission impacts of electricity market transition in China: A case study of Guangdong Province,"China’s electricity system is the world’s largest, in terms of installed generating capacity, and is also the world’s largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, China embarked on reforms in its electricity sector that aim to introduce market mechanisms in wholesale pricing. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission impacts of transitioning to electricity markets in China, focusing on Guangdong Province. We find that market reforms deliver significant annual cost savings (21 to 63 billion yuan, 9%–27% reduction in total costs in a base case) to consumers in Guangdong, with smaller production cost savings (12 billion yuan, 13% reduction in production costs in a base case). Savings for consumers are accompanied by a large reduction in net revenues for coal and natural gas generators, raising concerns about generator solvency, longer-term resource adequacy, and the need for transition mechanisms. Market reforms increase CO2 emissions in Guangdong, as a result of gas-to-coal switching, though higher hydropower imports from neighboring provinces could offset these emissions. CO2 pricing has a limited impact on CO2 emissions in the short run and has the potential to lead to significant wealth transfers. The most important benefit of market reforms will be in providing an economic framework for longer-term operations and investment.","1. Introduction

In 2002, China began an ambitious round of electricity reforms aimed at transitioning the sector toward wholesale competition. These reforms created separate, nationally-owned generating companies from the State Power Corporation, but efforts to create wholesale market mechanisms were put on hold following explosive growth in electricity demand in the wake of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization. For more than a decade, a series of government-set generation tariffs filled the gap. These tariffs were set on an embedded (long-run average) cost basis and generators were operated (dispatched) to ensure fair cost recovery under these tariffs [1]. This approach created operating inefficiencies and led to higher emissions, as units with higher operating costs were dispatched when lower-cost and lower-emitting units were available [2].

In March 2015, the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued an overarching policy document (“Document 9”) that officially resumed the reform process. Document 9 outlined series of broadly framed tasks for reforms: improving price formation; creating and expanding the institutions to support wholesale transactions; opening the retail market to new entrants; improving reliability and safety; and strengthening oversight of investment planning [3].

Document 9 was followed by several supporting policy documents, focusing on different aspects of reform, and the designation of reform pilots. Wholesale and retail competition, and more recently the creation of spot markets, is a centerpiece of reform efforts. Pilots for wholesale market reforms remain in the early stages, though are expected to accelerate in the next two to three years.

As China’s largest provincial economy and its largest electricity consumer, Guangdong has been a key actor in the national reform process. Guangdong began a wholesale competition reform pilot in 2015, enabling large industrial customers to directly sign contracts with generators or to purchase their power through competitive retail providers. To facilitate this market, a consortium of government agencies and industry facilitated the creation of a power exchange that supports forward bilateral contracts and centralized monthly auctions for energy. Guangdong is in the process of establishing a spot market pilot [4].

Guangdong’s market reforms will have regional implications. Like many of China’s coastal provinces, Guangdong relies on imports for a large share of its peak demand and annual energy needs. Imports include point-to-point and network-network imports from neighboring provinces in the China Southern Grid, as well as longer-distance imports from dedicated facilities like the Three Gorges Dam. More recently, neighboring provinces, and in particular Yunnan Province, have experienced significant hydropower curtailment, leading to questions over whether more of this energy could be imported to Guangdong and at what price. Because of Guangdong’s import dependence, questions around market design in Guangdong are fundamentally regional in nature.

This paper assesses the cost, environmental, and political economic impacts of electricity market reforms in Guangdong Province. The paper makes four main contributions. First, as far as we know this is the first quantitative assessment of the cost and environmental impacts of electricity market reform in China. There is a rich literature covering the institutional and political economy challenges to electricity reform in China [1,5–13], but much of it predates the current round of reforms and its emphasis on markets. Pollitt et al. [14] examines the power reform in Guangdong and provides an overview of its policies, operations, and potential effects on power sector operation and investment, but this work is qualitative. Kahrl et al. [2] find that the production cost savings from transitioning to least-cost dispatch in China’s Guangxi Province would likely be small because larger coal generators with similar heat rates account for most non-hydro generation in the province. However, this analysis does not explicitly examine the rent transfers that occur as a result of the transition to a market clearing price or their implications for electricity market design.

Second, the analysis provides further evidence on the importance of well-designed transition mechanisms and of accounting for in electricity market design [15,16]. For instance, poor design of transition mechanisms – disincentives for long-term contracting, frozen retail rates, lack of clarity over tradeoffs between reliability and spot prices were an important driver of the collapse of California’s electricity market [17–19]. Evidence from this analysis suggests that a similar set of transition issues will be critical to address in China as well.

Third, the analysis provides a bridge between planning studies for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in China’s electricity sector and the market and ultimately cost impacts of CO 2 pricing in electricity generation. Most studies of CO 2 abatement costs in China’s electricity sector are engineering-economic estimates [20–22], which provide useful benchmarks of CO 2 price levels but not their impact on electricity market prices and the shifting of economic rents that occurs as a result of CO 2 pricing. The results in this analysis underscore the importance of considering the market and revenue impacts of CO 2 pricing in designing a portfolio of emission reduction policies.

Fourth, the paper provides a reasonably low-data-input approach to examining electricity market outcomes, balancing the detail needed to produce robust results with the transparency needed to understand how changing assumptions would affect the results. This approach could be applied in other national and sub-national contexts where data availability and quality is a concern.

The paper’s results have implications and relevance beyond Guangdong and China. Guangdong has been at the forefront of electricity reforms in China and other provinces are likely to follow its lead. China’s electricity system is of global importance, because of its size, links to the rest of the Chinese economy, and its contribution to regional air pollution and global climate change. China’s electricity reforms over the next decade will shape the sector’s environmental footprint, which has generated a significant amount of international interest in its reform process. Lastly, other large developing countries, including India, are considering market-oriented reforms in their electricity sectors. Many will face transition issues similar to those in China.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the methods used in the paper, with a more detailed description included as an Appendix. Section 3 presents aggregate and generatorspecific results. Section 4 distills key conclusions and discusses their implications.

2. Methods

Wholesale electricity markets facilitate transactions between electricity buyers and sellers. By doing so, well-designed markets will also facilitate the least-cost operation of the electricity system, whereby generators with the lowest operating costs are dispatched to meet electricity demand subject to generator and transmission constraints. Short-term electricity markets are typically cleared and settled using market clearing prices, which are based on the marginal cost of the generator dispatched to meet the next increment of demand. In these short-term markets, buyers and seller payments are based on market clearing prices.

Our analysis compares a market scenario, in which generators are dispatched in order of their operating costs with a market clearing price, to a reference scenario, which uses historical tariffs and an idealized, historical approach to operating generators. The reference scenario represents an idealized benchmark, as historical operating practices may have deviated from our assumptions and, relatedly, some of the cost savings from market reforms may have already been realized through bilateral markets. Nevertheless, given the lack of publiclyavailable data on actual operations or bilateral market transactions we argue that the reference case still provides a useful benchmark against which to compare market savings.

The market scenario assumes that a wholesale market for generation – however designed and implemented – facilitates economic (“merit order”) dispatch. This assumption is consistent with theory and practice, where forward contract prices and regulated prices converge toward spot market pricing over time.

With market clearing prices, generators earn the difference between the market clearing price and their operating costs in each hour. In a market, these net revenues contribute to generators’ recovery of their investment, tax, and other fixed costs. Generator net revenues are often expressed on a per kilowatt per unit time basis (e.g., yuan/kW-yr), which facilitates comparison with their anticipated recovery of fixed costs over that timeframe (e.g., one year).

Market pricing may cause revenue shortfalls for generators, leading to concerns over reliability or the achievement of environmental goals. To address this concern, we consider two additional market scenarios in which generators receive additional scarcity revenues, which compensate generators for reliability services, or premium payments, which compensate wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro generators for their abovemarket costs.

We use a broad definition of the term ‘scarcity payment’ throughout to refer to any payments made to generators by electricity consumers that compensate them for their availability during supply-constrained periods, such as payments made via scarcity prices or capacity markets. 1 We use ‘premium payment’ to refer to the above-market cost (if

any) of hydropower, solar, wind, and nuclear generation.

Table 1 summarizes key assumptions of the three market scenarios: market only, low scarcity and premium payments (SPP), and high SPP.

For hydropower, solar, wind, and nuclear generation, premium payments for different resources (PPY i for resource i) in the High SPP and Low SPP scenarios are shown in Eqs. (1) and (2)
 
where FIT i is the feed-in tariff for resource i, GEN h,i is generation in hour h for resource i, MCP h is the market clearing price in hour h, SCP is the scarcity payment (100 yuan/kW-yr or 400 yuan/kW-yr) and CPC i is the reliable capacity contribution for resource i (see Appendix A for details).

In the “Market Only” scenario, total generation costs to electricity consumers in Guangdong only include energy market costs, absent any form of scarcity payments to generators. In the “Low SPP” scenario, all generators and imports receive some form of a scarcity payment, as would be the case in a capacity market or with scarcity reserve pricing, with a relatively low payment (100 yuan/kW-yr) that reflects current oversupply if imports are able to participate in price formation for scarcity payments. 2 Hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generators are paid

More specifically, in this paper we make a distinction between “scarcity payments” and “scarcity pricing.” We use “scarcity payments” and “scarcity revenues” more broadly to refer to payments that incentivize generators to be available when supply is scarce. Scarcity payments could include payments to generators from a scarcity reserve pricing mechanism (e.g., ERCOT’s operating reserve demand curve or Germany’s high energy market price caps) or a centralized or bilateral capacity market, and are the portion of an equivalent market price duration curve (PDC) where prices exceed a variable cost-based benchmark. In a competitive environment, total scarcity payments – the area between the PDC and the benchmark cost curve – should, in principle, be the same regardless of approach (e.g., scarcity reserve pricing, capacity payments). We use “scarcity pricing” to refer to market prices that reflect scarcity conditions, as would be the case in energy-only market.

Capacity market prices in a market that has excess generation will tend to

the difference between their feed-in tariff and their energy market and scarcity revenues.

In the “High SPP” scenario, all thermal generators within Guangdong receive a much higher scarcity payment (400 yuan/kW-yr), reflecting a political decision to compensate thermal generators for above-market costs at a price close to the gross cost of new capacity. 3 Hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generators are paid the difference between their feed-in tariff and their energy market revenues. The “Low SPP” and “High SPP” scenarios are intended to represent two ends of a spectrum for the level of scarcity revenues in the market case scenarios.

We approximate economic dispatch in these market cases using a “stack” model. The stack model orders generators in each hour in order of operating (variable) cost to meet demand, ignoring generator and transmission constraints. This approach provides a reasonable, high-level estimate of changes in cost and intuition for structural drivers of change, without the need for more detailed operational data and assumptions.

Because it ignores generator and transmission constraints, the stack model will tend to overstate changes in the market case, and thus any market case savings. However, the main factors that drive changes in dispatch and costs between the reference and market cases are less affected by detailed constraints. Given the need for transparency due to data limitations, the stack model thus provides a reasonable balance between simplicity and completeness.

Both the market and reference scenarios use a common set of key “base case” assumptions, shown in Table 2. We examine the impact of these assumptions on the results through sensitivity analysis.

A detailed description of methods, assumptions, and data sources is included in Appendix A.

3. Results and discussions

The results are oriented around a base case scenario, where the values of six key variables (Table 2) are constrained close to historical values. We then explore incremental sensitivities around these key variables. For the overall results, we report three key metrics: (1) total generation costs, which include all payments made to generators, using tariffs in the reference case and energy market, scarcity, and premium payments in the market case; (2) production costs, which are limited to generator operating costs but include any CO 2 emission costs; and (3) within-province CO 2 emissions.

The results – and in particular cost savings to consumers and net

(footnote continued) fall to the net going forward costs for the marginal capacity resource. The estimate here uses a ratio (∼20%) between capacity market clearing prices in an oversupplied market and gross cost of new energy (CONE) based loosely on estimates from the U.S. For instance, the gross CONE used in the PJM 2019/ 2020 and 2020/2021 Base Residual Auctions is ∼$130/kW-yr, whereas PJM capacity market prices in years with excess supply have generally been around or less than $100/MW-day ($36.5/kW-yr) [39]. In California, Resource Adequacy contract prices were ∼$36/kW-yr in 2016, relative to a gross CONE of ∼$200/kW-yr for a new CCGT or CT [40,41].

3 The gross capacity (fixed) cost of a new coal-fired and gas-fired generator in

China has generally ranged from 400 to 500 yuan/kW-yr during the past decade, based on overnight capital costs of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan/kW.

3.1. Overall results

Economic dispatch in the market case scenarios leads to a significant reduction in total generation costs, a moderate reduction in production costs, and a small increase in CO 2 emissions (Table 3). Total generation costs fall from 233 billion yuan in the reference case to 170–212 billion in the market case scenarios, a savings of 21–63 billion yuan (9% to 27%). Production costs fall from 94 billion yuan in the reference cost to 82 billion in the market case, a savings of 12 billion yuan (13%). CO 2 emissions increase by 7 million tons (MtCO 2 ), or by around 3%. Table 3 illustrates that the extent of scarcity and premium payments across the market case scenarios is primarily a question of fixed cost allocation and does not affect operations (production costs or emissions).

Table 4 shows a more detailed breakdown of total generation costs between the reference and market cases. Without scarcity and premium payments, total generation costs fall by 63 billion yuan. Import costs increase by 3 billion yuan, as Guangdong’s average market price is higher than its reference import tariff. Adding scarcity and premium payments in the Low SPP and High SPP scenarios increases total generation costs by 24–42 billion yuan relative to the Market Only scenario, but total generation costs in the High SPP and Low SPP scenarios still fall by 21–40 billion yuan, respectively, relative to the reference case (Fig. 1). Total generation cost savings are savings to electricity consumers.

Three main factors drive total generation cost savings: (1) a reduction in energy margins for thermal generators; (2) natural gas to coal switching; and (3) average heat rate improvements for coal and gas units.

Reduction in energy margins for thermal generators. Current average tariffs for coal generators are high relative to costs. At 303 yuan/MWh, average energy market prices are close to the marginal cost of a mid-merit (medium–low efficiency) coal unit. At 306 yuan/MWh, average revenues for coal generators are close to this average market price. For coal generators, most of the difference between average

revenues and their average reference tariff (450 yuan/MWh) would be a contribution to generator fixed costs. However, this difference of around 150 yuan/MWh – around 600 yuan per kW per year (yuan/kWyr) – is higher than the fixed costs of a new coal generator. 4 As a result, even after making 400 yuan/kW-yr scarcity payments to all withinprovince thermal generators in the High SPP scenario, total generation costs fall (Fig. 2).

Natural gas to coal switching. Natural gas generation is significantly more expensive to operate than coal generation, due to Guangdong’s high delivered natural gas prices. In a merit order dispatch, coal generation displaces natural gas generation in the dispatch order and natural gas units effectively become a peaking resource during the summer. Average annual operating hours for coal units increase from 3,932 in the reference case to 4,543 in the market case, while average annual operating hours for natural gas units fall from 3,200 in the reference case to 154 in the market case (Fig. 3). Because coal generation has lower operating costs, this shift from natural gas to coal reduces production costs. On its own, this shift would lead to a large increase in CO 2 emissions. However, a decline in the average heat rate of coal and gas generators, as a result of increasing operating hours for more efficient generators, partially offsets this effect and leads to a relatively small overall increase in CO 2 emissions in the market case.

Average heat rate improvements for coal and gas units. Enabling more efficient coal and gas generators to displace less efficient generators in the dispatch order reduces average heat rates for coal generators by 3% and gas generators by 11%. Reductions in average heat rates for both coal and gas generators reduce production costs. Coal generation heat rate improvements dominate this effect because coal generation accounts for a much larger share of total generation.

Table 5 summarizes the changes in average operation and performance for coal and gas units in the reference and market cases. Disentangling the effects of natural gas to coal switching and average heat rate improvements is complicated by the fact that average heat rates and operating hours are changing simultaneously.

3.2. Generator-specific results

Each generator earns revenues in the energy market equal to the product of an hourly market clearing price and the generator’s net output in that hour. Inframarginal generators – those whose costs are lower than the market clearing price – earn net revenues that contribute to fixed cost recovery. Fixed costs include fixed O&M costs, revenues for natural gas units are very low, reflecting the fact that, when they are operating, they are typically the marginal generator.

Given reduced net revenues for generators, some form of side payments to generators may be needed to meet reliability, renewable energy, and emissions goals. Our results show that adding premiums for wind, solar, and nuclear generation and scarcity payments increases revenues for generators in the Low SPP and High SPP scenarios (Fig. 4b and c).

Fig. 4b illustrates that, in the Low SPP scenario, where all withinprovince generators and imports were eligible to receive 100 yuan/kWyr payments for their availability during peak demand periods and nonthermal generators were paid a premium payment that was the difference between their feed-in tariff and their market and scarcity revenues, scarcity payments to hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generators are a small share of total net revenues, but can be a significant portion of net revenues for less efficient coal and natural gas generators. However, net revenues (including scarcity payments) of thermal power plants are still much lower than what those under the reference scenario. Fig. 4c shows that in the High SPP scenario, where thermal generators were paid 400 yuan/kW-yr for their availability during peak demand periods and non-thermal generators were paid a premium payment that was the difference between their feed-in tariff and market revenues, net revenues to Coal 1 (693 yuan/kW-yr) are closer to net revenues under the average feed-in tariff (830 yuan/kW-yr) and could potentially support new investment, but there is no indication that Guangdong needs new generation investment in the near term.

3.3. Sensitivities

The results may be sensitive to several variables, four of which we focus on in this analysis: (1) the timing and level of net imports; (2) coal and natural gas fuel price levels; (3) the timing and level of hydro resources, and levels of solar and wind generating capacity; 5 and (4) CO 2 prices. This section examines each of sensitivities around these variables in greater detail, by assessing their impact on total generation costs, production costs, and CO 2 emissions in the Low SPP scenario. We use the Low SPP scenario because it represents a middle-of-the-road estimate of total generation costs, though we explore areas where total generation costs would be structurally different in the Market Only or High SPP scenarios. Production costs and CO 2 emissions do not vary among scenarios.

3.3.1. Net imports Currently (in the reference scenario), Guangdong’s annual electricity imports are determined bilaterally through negotiations. In the market scenario, they are determined through differences in marginal cost: if the market clearing price in Guangdong is higher than the marginal cost of generation in surrounding provinces, those provinces will find it economically attractive to export power to Guangdong.

Changes in import levels may occur on both the alternating current (AC) interties connecting Guangdong with its neighbors, and the point-to-point direct current (DC) and AC lines that directly connect Guangdong’s electricity system with dedicated hydro and thermal power plants in neighboring provinces. In both cases, current indications are that import levels are suppressed; that is, it would be economically efficient for Guangdong to import more electricity and rely more on neighboring provinces to provide peak capacity.

We examine two sensitivities for import levels: (1) an incremental case, where imports rise from current levels of 28% to 35% of total annual electricity consumption, and (2) a high case, where imports rise to 40% of total consumption.

With the price-taker assumption for imports, increasing net imports reduces total generation costs, within-province production costs, and within-province CO 2 emissions (Fig. 5, Table 6). Incremental expansion of imports displaces higher cost generation in Guangdong, but this effect saturates somewhat at higher import levels once higher cost generation has already been displaced. Each percentage point increase in imports decreases within-province CO 2 emissions by about 5 million tons. Increasing the level of imports from the current 28% to 35 and 40% in the future would lead to about 15% and 25% reduction in CO 2 emissions, respectively, while reducing total generation costs by 3% and 5%.

Imports affect total generation costs and within-province production costs differently, as Table 6 illustrates. Higher imports result in larger reductions in production costs than in total generation costs, because in some hours imports are replacing generation in Guangdong without changing the market clearing price.

If import levels into Guangdong are allowed to increase, import levels will likely also become more variable because a significant portion of Guangdong’s imports are from hydropower. Like the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market in California, average market prices in Guangdong would be heavily influenced by inter-annual variability in precipitation and hydropower output.

In the reference case, imports are assumed to be block loaded in onpeak and off-peak periods (“TOU block”). Allowing greater flexibility in import flows would allow the timing of imports to better match hourly marginal generation costs in Guangdong. We approximate this effect by examining a sensitivity case in which imports follow load, with the “shape” of imports matching the load shape (“load following”).

As Table 7 shows, the primary effect of allowing more flexibility in imports is in dampening market prices (reducing total generation costs), whereas the effect on production costs and CO 2 emissions is relatively limited. This market price effect diminishes at higher levels of imports.

Whether the interprovincial and interregional transmission system would be able to support higher levels of imports into Guangdong is unclear. In our base case, imports reach a maximum of 25 GW. In the 35% sensitivity, maximum imports rise to 31 GW (35 GW load following); in the 40% sensitivity they increase to 35 GW (40 GW load following).

3.3.2. Fuel prices The impact of coal and natural gas fuel price levels on the outcomes of market reforms is complex, because in theory it should depend on what the impact of fuel price changes would have been in a fictitious counterfactual world. From a more practical and political perspective, the most important reference for considering the fuel price impacts of reforms is current total generation costs, which captures the significant historical lag between fuel price changes and generation tariff changes in China.

For reference, our base case coal prices are 800 yuan per ton coal equivalent, or 571 yuan per raw ton of 5,000 kCal/kg coal. Our base natural gas prices are 1,870 yuan per ton coal equivalent, or 2.3 yuan per m3 .

Higher/lower coal prices tend to reduce/increase total generation cost savings in the market case (Table 8). At an extreme, total generation costs in the market case would be higher than in the reference case if delivered coal prices rose to 1,100 yuan per ton coal equivalent (tce), or around 790 yuan per raw ton of 5,000 kCal/kg coal. This threshold is lower (just over 900 yuan/tce) in the High SPP case.

Differences between total generation costs in the reference and market cases reflect transfers and different risk allocations between generators and consumers. Generators increase/decrease profits in the reference case if coal prices fall/rise because the generation tariff remains fixed in the short run. In the market case, market prices adjust to allow generators to recover changing fuel costs. Consumers are protected from rising coal costs in the reference case, but lose any upside from lower coal costs.

Although total generation costs are insulated from fuel price changes in the reference case, production costs are not. That is, changes in fuel costs will affect total operating costs regardless of whether generation tariffs adjust to account for fuel cost changes. As Table 8 shows, higher coal prices will tend to reduce production cost savings between the reference and market cases, because they reduce the benefits of coal to natural gas switching. At the coal price range in Table 8, higher coal prices have no impact on dispatch order and CO2  emissions in the market case.

Higher/lower natural gas prices similarly reduce/increase market case benefits because natural gas generation tariffs are fixed in the short run. However, the effect of natural gas prices on the results is limited because natural gas accounts for such a small share of generation (less than 1%) in the market case (Table 9). Higher natural gas prices have the opposite effect as coal prices on production cost savings, because they increase the benefits of coal to natural gas switching.

3.3.3. Hydropower, wind, and solar

3.3.3.1. Hydropower output. The amount and hourly shape of withinprovince hydropower may affect market outcomes through its impact on market prices and total fixed costs. In the base case, hydropower is assumed to be dispatched in on-peak and off-peak blocks (“TOU block” in Table 10). Allowing hydropower to be dispatched more flexibly, in this case by allowing it to follow load (“load following”), reduces costs and emissions, but as Table 10 shows this effect is small.

2016 was a “wet” hydro year, meaning that operating hours for hydropower were high relative to recent history. Reducing hydro operating hours to 2015 levels (2,096 h) increases total costs, production costs, market prices, and CO 2 emissions, as within-province thermal generation – mostly coal but some natural gas – makes up the shortfall.

3.3.3.2. Wind and solar generation capacity. Wind and solar generation affect market prices through annual variation in generation and through increases in installed capacity. In this analysis, we focus on the latter effect, examining the impact of a doubling and tripling of base case wind and solar installed capacity. Table 11 shows that a doubling and tripling of wind and solar generation capacity lead to increases in total costs through higher premiums (about 2%), and decreases in production costs, average market prices, and CO 2 emissions (−7%) by displacing more expensive and inefficient thermal generation. However, given the fall in solar and wind generation tariffs, increasing renewable generation could be still an effective strategy to reduce carbon emissions.

3.3.4. CO 2 prices Imposing CO 2 prices on thermal generators leads to increases in production and total generation costs. The effect on total generation costs will be larger than the impact on production costs due to the embedding of CO 2 costs into market clearing prices. For instance, if a less efficient coal generator is on the margin, its price, and thus the market clearing price, will increase by its marginal emissions rate multiplied by a CO 2 allowance price. This higher market clearing price affects all load, rather than just the portion that is served by the less efficient coal generator. Generators that have lower emissions rates than this less efficient coal generator will increase their economic rents.

As Table 12 and Fig. 6 show, these price impacts are substantial. A CO 2 price of 50–200 yuan/tCO 2 increases total generation costs by 21 to 87 billion yuan but has little to no impact on dispatch order and CO 2 emissions in the short run. A 500 yuan/tCO 2 price leads to larger reductions in emissions but increases total and production costs by more than a factor of two. Maintaining CO 2 emissions at the reference level (231 million tons CO2 , “ref” in Table 12) requires a CO 2 price of around 260 yuan/tCO 2 . Because coal generation drives CO 2 emission costs, most of the increase in market clearing prices with CO 2 pricing occurs during non-peak periods, when gas generators are not operating.

CO 2 costs impact generator gross and net revenues, and in doing so influence scarcity and premium payments to generators. For hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generators, higher market prices resulting from the passthrough of CO costs increase gross revenues without increasing their costs, leading to2 higher gross revenues and lower premium payments. Above 500 yuan/tCO2 , for instance, premium payments become negligible.

By impacting net revenues for thermal generators, CO 2 pricing will also influence the level of any scarcity payments made to these generators, though we are not able to capture these effects in our analysis. In general, market price effects from CO 2 costs will tend to increase net revenues for more efficient thermal generators (Coal 1, Gas 1, Coal 2) and reduce them for less efficient coal generators (Coal 3–6). This reduction in net revenues for less efficient coal units is due to higher costs, and thus lower economic rents, when gas generators are on the margin. The impact of changes in net revenues on scarcity payments will depend on which generator is on the margin for price formation. For instance, in a capacity market, if less efficient coal or gas generators are setting the market clearing price, capacity prices may rise. If more efficient generators are setting price, capacity prices may fall.

Some of the impact of high CO 2 costs on retail rates could be mitigated by returning revenues from CO 2 allowance auctions or taxes to consumers. The maximum amount that can be returned is the total revenue generated by the auctions or taxes, equal to the CO 2 price multiplied by total emissions. For instance, with a 200 yuan/tCO 2 price the total returnable revenue would be 46 billion yuan. The difference between this amount and the change in total generation costs between the 200 yuan/tCO 2 and the base case in Table 12 (87 billion yuan) reflects the net of: (1) increased economic rents to generators, particularly to non-fossil fuel generators; (2) lower premium payments to generators as a result of higher gross revenues to hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generators. With a 200 yuan/tCO 2 CO 2 price, net costs increase by 41 billion yuan, or a 21% increase over the base case. Most of the increase in economic rents, net of reduced premium payments, is for hydro generators. The results in Table 12 illustrate that, for provinces with minimal curtailment of hydro, wind, and solar generation and where imports are constrained, CO 2 pricing is an expensive means of achieving CO 2 emission reductions in the short run. In Guangdong, CO 2 prices must cover the spread between the marginal cost of coal and natural gas generation to change dispatch. Table 13 shows breakeven CO 2 prices for each natural gas and coal category. This implies that for Gas 1, a 165 yuan/tCO 2 price is needed for it to displace Coal 6 in the merit order, a 192 yuan/tCO 2 price is needed to displace Coal 5, and so on. Beyond replacing some inefficient coal generation with efficient gas generation, coal-gas switching is an expensive mitigation strategy in China because of the large spread between coal and gas prices.

This analysis focuses on short-term market impacts, whereas a goal of CO 2 pricing is to influence longer-term investment decisions. Table 14 shows a similar simplified CO 2 price breakeven analysis for hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear generation replacing coal, based on current feed-in tariffs for hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear and, as a simplification, assuming no capacity value for new resources. With modest CO 2 prices, hydro and nuclear could be cost-competitive with less efficient coal, whereas average prices for wind and solar would need to fall significantly – at least if current costs are close to feed-in tariff levels – for these resources to be cost-competitive with lower CO2  prices. 4. Conclusions

This study examined the economic and CO 2 emissions impacts of market reforms in Guangdong. We found that the economic dispatch of existing power plants, facilitated by reforms, reduced total (fixed and operating) generating costs by 21–63 billion yuan per year (9–27%), reduced production costs by 12 billion yuan per year (13%), and increased CO 2 emissions by 7 million tons (3%) for the year of this analysis (2016).

Economic dispatch with a market clearing price produced an average market price of around 300 yuan/MWh. This average price is significantly less than the current benchmark tariff for coal units (450 yuan/MWh), implying a large reduction in net revenues for coal generators and raising concerns about their financial solvency and, by extension, system reliability given that within-province coal units account for around 60% of Guangdong’s peak generation needs. Market reforms similarly depressed net revenues for natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar generators, but slightly increased them for hydro generators. To address issues around generator solvency, reliability, and emissions, some form of payment for reliability and environmental attributes may be needed.

We explored two scenarios for providing scarcity revenues for thermal (coal, natural gas) and non-thermal (hydro, nuclear, wind, solar) generators and premiums for non-thermal generators. The Low SPP scenario was agnostic as to how generators earn scarcity revenues. For instance, a capacity market or scarcity reserve pricing could produce scarcity revenues. The High SPP scenario implicitly assumed some form of administrative payments to thermal generators, given that prices in this scenario were likely above a market price for available capacity. It represents a high-end estimate for possible scarcity and premium payments to generators. The High SPP scenario corresponds to the lower end (21 billion yuan) of the total generation cost savings range, illustrating that even with high side payments to generators market reforms can lead to substantial savings for consumers.

The results were sensitive to assumptions around several variables, four of which we explored in this study: (1) net imports, (2) coal and natural gas fuel prices, (3) hydro, solar, and wind generation, and (4) CO 2 prices. As described in Section 3.3, each of these sensitivities may have a significant impact on market outcomes.

The study highlights several important electricity market design issues for Guangdong.

Issues around interprovincial trade are a critical and politically sensitive part of market design for Guangdong. Allowing generators in neighboring provinces to participate in Guangdong’s wholesale market would create winners and losers. Higher hydropower imports would reduce consumer costs and generator emissions in Guangdong, as well as reducing the level of scarcity prices or capacity payments needed to maintain a target level of reliability in Guangdong. However, higher imports would also reduce net revenues for generators within Guangdong, lead to a net transfer of economic rents to neighboring provinces, and likely increase wholesale price volatility within Guangdong due to greater exposure to interannual variability in hydro generation. Higher market-driven imports into Guangdong would also put upward pressure on prices in neighboring provinces, by creating a more explicit opportunity cost, and may increase their emissions. Facilitating higher levels of imports would require addressing transmission cost allocation issues, as interprovincial and interregional transmission costs are currently incorporated into import tariffs. Resolving these issues requires a governance framework for negotiating market rules among provinces.

Market transition will likely require addressing revenue impacts on generators. Competitive market prices could drive generator net revenues – market revenues minus operating costs – below the going-forward fixed costs that existing generating companies need to recover to remain solvent, which may lead them to mothball or retire units that are needed for reliability or to meet environmental requirements. If payments in excess of what can be earned from the competitive energy (and ancillary services) markets are needed to address generator revenue shortfalls, it raises the question of what mechanism is most appropriate to China’s political and institutional context.

The design of environmental regulation is a critical consideration for electricity market reforms. Guangdong’s Pearl River Delta is one of three regions in China that were required to achieve significant absolute reductions in PM 2.5 concentrations by 2017. In the short run, however, electricity market reforms may increase coal-fired generation within the province and complicate efforts to meet air quality goals and reduce CO 2 emissions. Relatively high CO 2 prices, here estimated at around 260 yuan/tCO 2 , would be necessary to avoid increases in CO 2 emissions during market transition, but emissions pricing is one among several strategies for regulating emissions. By integrating the design of environmental regulation for the electricity sector into electricity market reforms, policymakers can strike the right balance between market-based and administrative approaches to achieving emission reductions.

The largest benefits of market reforms in Guangdong are likely to be long term. Most of the potential short-term cost savings associated with electricity reform in China are cost transfers from generators to consumers – the accumulated legacy of central planning and incomplete reforms. Going forward, and in the long run, the largest benefits of market reforms will be in improvements in operational and investment efficiency that result from having an economic framework for short-run operations and longer-term investment decisions. Market prices can help to guide both the level and composition of investments in utilityscale generation, energy storage, and demand-side resources."
14,Economic dispatch savings in the coal-fired power sector: An empirical study of China,"The current equal share dispatch approach has often been criticized for its negative influence on the electricity system operation in China, which worsens the energy security, environmental sustainability and affordability problems. To provide references for the on-going electricity market reform, this study employs an optimization model to quantify the economic dispatch savings in the coal-fired power sector. Key findings are summarized as follows: (1) The heat rates of 2803 coal generators in China range from 273.91 gce/kWh to 348.38 gce/kWh units in 2014, and the great differences among these generators at different geographical areas exhibit the necessity for economic dispatch. (2) 5.67% of the coal used for power generation could be saved from economic dispatch in a provincial level, the monetary value of which can reduce the average electricity price by 0.0058 yuan/kWh in 2014. (3) Three major political and economic challenges hinder the transition from the current dispatch mode to economic dispatch, namely the insufficient running hours for cost recovery, limited cross-border trading due to electricity over-supply and local protectionism, and the political economy problems from generators of different ownership types.","1. Introduction

Half of the world's coal was consumed by China in 2015, and 47.3% of them went to the power generation sector (BP, 2016; NBS, 2017). However, the Chinese coal reserve-production ratio is only 31 years in 2015, which is much smaller than that of Unites States (292 years), Japan (296 years) and world average (114 years). Thus, the previous popular description of Chinese energy resource endowments as ‘rich in coal’ faces big challenges nowadays. Moreover, the coal-dominated power generation mix is also the major source of carbon emissions and air pollutants. 43% of the national carbon emissions came from the power sector in 2014, while the proportion of SO2 , NO x and PM 2.5 was 31.4%, 29.8% and 5.6% respectively (Hu and Nan, 2016). In addition, the high industrial electricity prices in China reduce its manufacturing competitiveness against competitors. For example, Chinese industrial electricity prices in 2014 are about 50% higher than that of the United States, while the fuel price gaps can only explain 63% of the differences (Pollitt et al., 2017). Therefore, conserving the energy in the power sector is a good choice to address challenges of energy security, environmental sustainability and affordability (Chang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016; Meng et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2016).

The amount of coal consumed for electricity generation is not only inﬂuenced by the advanced levels of equipment and wires, but also affected by how the generators are operated. Most countries in the world dispatch the generators based on merit order of generation cost, which is also called economic dispatch. Under this dispatch rule, the lower cost generators would have the priority to be dispatched ﬁrst if the grid security is not affected (Bistline, 2015; Gao and Yang, 2010; Lynch et al., 2013; Steinberg and Smith, 1943). However, coal generators in China are dispatched in a unique way called ‘equal share’, and all the generators of similar type and capacity will have approximately the same allotment of running hours in a year (Kahrl et al., 2013). This will deﬁnitely waste energy because the higher efﬁciency generators have the same running hours with the lower ones. Moreover, this dispatch rule is a black box, and the details of how to allocate the annual operation time is not open to the general public. The equal share dispatch rule originated from a period when China suffered serious electricity shortages. To solve this problem, the government promised to provide adequate operation time for the generators to recover their investment cost (Kahrl et al., 2011), and fair opportunities were valued most in the allocation during that time. Luckily, this strategy worked and many new generation units had been built in a short time. The equal share strategy has been retained so far due to multiple political and economic reasons (Gao and Yang, 2010; Kahrl et al., 2013; Ma and Zhao, 2015; Robinson and Li, 2017), however, this dispatch mode has often criticized for its lower efﬁciency and related environmental pollution problems (Pollitt et al., 2017).

There are several other motivations for the Chinese government to push forward the economic dispatch in the power sector now. The No.9 document, issued by the Chinese State Council in March 2015, signaled a new round of electricity market reform. One of the important tasks of this on-going reform is to change the electricity dispatch rule to a more market-based one (Hu and Cheng, 2017). Moreover, China is now experiencing a serious over-supply problems in the coal-ﬁred power capacity (CarbonTracker, 2016; Kahrl, 2016; Lin et al., 2016), which is partly due to the false signals sent to the investors by the current equal share dispatch. The lifetimes of coal generators in China are generally about 40 years, and there are great efﬁciency differences among these generators built in different periods (Chen et al., 2016; Ma and Zhao, 2015). In addition, the implementation of economic dispatch in the electricity sector will not only conserve fossil fuel consumption, it can also reduce the air pollution and its related health problems. To provide references for the possible beneﬁts from this on-going electricity market reform, this study estimates the economic dispatch savings in the Chinese coal-ﬁred power sector, which is aimed at answering the following three questions:

(1) What are the heat rate differences among the coal generators in China? Are they big enough to demonstrate the necessity for economic dispatch?

(2) How much energy can be saved if the economic dispatch is implemented in China? What about the energy conservation potentials at different geographical areas?

(3) What are the political and economic challenges in China to change the current dispatch rule to economic dispatch?

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 describes the methodology and data. Section 4 provides the empirical results. Section 5 summarizes the conclusions and proposes some policy implications.

2. Literature review

Power system operation is a complex physical and engineering issue, which has to economically and continuously balance the supply and demand, while maintaining a variety of physical criteria, such as frequency, voltage, and capacity (Wang et al., 2008; Wood and Wollenberg, 2012). Many previous studies have been done to analyze the impacts of operational strategies on the power system (Bhattacharyya, 2007; Kirschen and Strbac, 2004; Moarefdoost et al., 2016; Oggioni et al., 2014; Wang and Shahidehpour, 1993; Wood and Wollenberg, 2012; Zimmerman et al., 2011), but the current studies mainly focus on the following three topics.

The ﬁrst category analyzes how to model the power system operation when more renewables are integrated into the system. This is a big challenge for the traditional power system operation because the electricity generated from renewables depends greatly on the weather conditions, which are both variable and uncertain. Thus, more sophisticated methods should be employed to model this new power system. Garcia-Gonzalez et al. (2008) investigated the beneﬁts of pumped-

storage units to balance the intermittency of wind power in Spain, and concluded that the total income can be increased by 2.53%. Tuohy et al. (2009) employed both deterministic models and stochastic models to analyze the operation costs in the high wind share scenario of Ireland, and found the total cost of stochastic models are 0.25% to

0.9% lesser than that of the deterministic ones. Qadrdan et al. (2014) estimated the impacts of wind power generation on the power system operation in Great Britain, and found that about 1% of the total operational cost can be reduced in stochastic models when compared with that of the deterministic models. Chattopadhyay (2014) evaluated the integration of renewable generation in India, and concluded that it will increase the power operation cost by 5.3%. Reddy and Bijwe (2015) proposed a new real-time dispatch model with consideration of the renewable electricity generation, and estimated that it could reduce 3% to 5.4% of the total cost in the traditional dispatch models.

The second category focuses on environmental economic dispatch, which integrates the environmental cost of different generation technologies into the power system operation. This is particularly important due to the serious air pollution and climate change issues facing by many countries today. Zhao et al. (2013) implemented the environmental economic dispatch in Liaoning's power sector for the year of 2010, and estimated that the air pollutants and carbon emissions can be reduced by 2.09% to 9.42%. Khan et al. (2015) optimized the power system operation in Pakistan with consideration of both fuel cost and carbon emissions cost, and found that the highest daily share of solar generation could range from 25.73% to 27.13%.

The third category estimates the energy saving or cost reduction potentials from economic dispatch, and these researches concentrated in the countries where economic dispatch has not been implemented yet. Gao and Yang (2010) investigated the economic dispatch potential among 54 coal generators in Jiangsu province in China, and found that

6.38% of the coal can be conserved from economic dispatch in 2008. Kahrl et al. (2013) estimated the energy saving potential from energy efﬁcient dispatch in Guangxi province in China, 1 and found that 2–4% of the coal could be saved from the coal generators. Zhong et al. (2015) explored the energy efﬁcient dispatch in Guangdong's power sector in 2012, which also considered the impacts of different loads on the generators' coal consumption. They found that 4% of the coal can be reduced from energy efﬁcient dispatch. Nikolakakis et al. (2017) evaluated the cost reduction potentials of economic dispatch in Bangladesh power sector, and found that the operational cost can be reduced by a very large share (76%).

These previous studies have provided good references for our research, based on which we could estimate the economic dispatch saving potentials in China's coal-ﬁred power sector. Compared with those researches, we contribute to the existing literature from two aspects.

(1) Most previous studies take only one province in China as a case study for economic dispatch. While we economically dispatch all the coal generators in China, which is of great signiﬁcance for the ongoing electricity market reform in the whole country. (2) We have quantiﬁed and compared the energy saving potential if economic dispatch is implemented at different geographical areas, and identiﬁed the political and economic challenges for the economic dispatch. Therefore, relevant compensation and transition mechanisms could be better established to achieve these beneﬁts.

3. Methodology and data

3.1. Research framework

The research framework of this study is shown in Fig. 1. We ﬁrstly get the installed capacity and generation cost of all the coal generators in China. The amount of annual electricity generation under the equal share dispatch is proportional to the generator's capacity size, while the amount of annual electricity generation under the economic dispatch is obtained from an optimization model, which minimize the total cost while meeting the electricity demand. Then, we estimate the energy saving potentials when economic dispatch is implemented in provincial, regional and national levels. Lastly, we analyze the political and economic challenges during the transition from the current dispatch rule to economic dispatch.

3.2. Data

This study analyzes the economic dispatch savings from all the coal generators in 2014 (2803 generation units, 832.31 GW), 2 which are located in 30 provinces and six regional grid areas in China (Table 1). The savings from economic dispatch are mainly inﬂuenced by the heat rate differences and total coal-ﬁred power generation. 3 However, the heat rates of coal generators are not publicly available and the amount of coal generation is mixed in the thermal generation (coal and gas), so we have to calculate these indicators on our own. The details of how we estimate them are provided in the appendix.

3.3. Economic dispatch optimization model for the coal-ﬁred power sector

To estimate the economic dispatch conservation potentials in the Chinese coal-ﬁred power sector, an optimization model which minimizes the total operational cost is established as below. where h i is the annual running hours of generator i, which is the decision variable of the optimization model; P i is the coal price charged with generator i, which is the annual average coal price in the province where generator i locates4 ; HR i is the heat rate of generator i; C i is the installed capacity of generator i; SE i is the share of self-used electricity in generator i, which is drawn from NBS (2015a); D K is the total coal electricity generated in area K; H is the total number of hours in one year; MT i is the maximum availability coefﬁcient of annual running time of generator i, which is drawn from NBS (2015a). The constraint (2) ensures that the total electricity generation requirement is met within area K; The constraint (3) limits the running hours of unit i within its maximum available hours.

The coal conservation potential (ΔCC) is the coal consumption difference between equal share dispatch and economic dispatch.

ΔCC ¼ CC 1 −CC2 

ð5Þ CC 2 ¼ HR i Á C i Á h i Ã ð6Þ where CC 1 is the coal consumption under the equal share dispatch rule, which is the actual coal consumption in China in 2014; CC 2 is the coal consumption under the economic dispatch rule, which is calculated based on the optimized annual running hours (hi ∗ ) from the optimization model.

4. Result analysis and discussion

4.1. Heat rate differences exhibits the necessity for economic dispatch

i

The calculated generation heat rates of the 2803 units in 2014 are shown in Fig. 2. As seen from this ﬁgure, the heat rates of Chinese coal generators range from 273.91 gce/kWh (Waigaoqiao-3 Generation Unit 2 in Shanghai) to 348.38 gce/kWh (Xilinhot-2 Generation Unit 1 in Inner Mongolia). Sun et al. (2015) states that the minimum generation heat rate of Chinese coal-ﬁred power plant is about 276.02 gce/kWh, while CEC (2012) mentions the maximum one is about 344.65 gce/kWh in 2012. Therefore, this proves that our estimation result is reliable to some extent. The capacity-weighted average heat rate of all the generators is 309.11 gce/kWh, which is much higher than that of the Japanese average value (292 gce/kWh) (IEA, 2015; NBS, 2015b). Moreover, the generators with bigger sizes tend to have lower heat rates, which can be evidenced from the fact that the bigger bubbles are usually located in the lower places.

The differences in the generation heat rates within a balancing area are important for the conservation potentials from economic dispatch, when compared with the equal share dispatch. If all else

things are kept equal, the bigger distribution differences of heat rate are, the larger amount of coal could be saved from economic dispatch. As shown in Fig. 2, at the national level, the gap between the maximum and the minimum heat rate is 74.47 gce/kWh, which is about 24% of the capacity-weighted average heat rate in China. At the regional level, the weighted average heat rate of generators in Northwest grid is the highest (317.06 gce/kWh), while the weighted average heat rate of generators in East China grid is the lowest (302.22 gce/kWh). This is because the economically developed regions can afford more advanced generation equipment (Ma and Zhao, 2015). In addition, they have retired or retroﬁtted most of the older or lower efﬁciency generators during the previous reform process (Yu et al., 2017). At the provincial level, Qinghai has the highest capacity-weighted average heat rate (324.93 gce/kWh), but the shortest band length with a conﬁdence level of 95% (12.89 gce/kWh). 5 Although Shanghai has the lowest average heat rate (296.57 gce/kWh), it also has the longest band length with a conﬁdence level of 95% (52.54 gce/kWh). Consequently, there are distinct differences among the generator heat rates at different geographical levels, which indicate the necessity for economic dispatch.

Another way to prove the necessity for reforming the present ‘equal share’ is to check whether the current dispatch mode is efﬁcient in the running time allocation. To answer this question, we have analyzed the correlation coefﬁcients between the efﬁciency and the allocated annual running time for some provinces. In these provinces, the operation time data are drawn from sampled plants whose installed capacity is over 1 GW (NBS, 2015a), 6 and their efﬁciencies are calculated based on the heat rates. 7 The estimated correlation coefﬁcients for the sampled provinces are shown in Fig. 3.

As seen from Fig. 3, 12 of the sampled provinces have negative correlations between the generation efﬁciencies and the allocated operation hours. The correlation coefﬁcients range from −0.67 (Guizhou) to −0.10 (Inner Mongolia). Moreover, these provinces do not only have the economically underdeveloped provinces, but also have some economically developed provinces like Guangdong and Tianjing. Therefore, this fact further demonstrates the signiﬁcance of economic dispatch in the coal-ﬁred power sector.

4.2. Energy saving potentials from economic dispatch

This section evaluates the energy saving potentials when economic dispatch is implemented in the provincial, regional and national levels respectively.

The total coal savings from economic dispatch in the provincial level is 71.78 Mtce in 2014, accounting for 5.67% of the national coal used for power generation. The monetary value of the coal savings can reduce the average electricity price by 0.0058 yuan/kWh, which equals to 1%2% of the electricity price in China (Pollitt et al., 2017). Moreover, the reduced carbon emissions from these coal savings represents 2.86% of Chinese total carbon emissions, and 0.79% of the world total carbon emissions (BP, 2016). Shandong has the largest amount of coal conservation (6.82 Mtce), while Beijing has the smallest energy savings (0.07 Mtce). Since every province has different amount of coal consumption used for power generation, it is more meaningful to compare the share of saving potentials among different provinces. As seen from Fig. 4, Liaoning province has the largest share (8.85%) of coal savings from economic dispatch, while Beijing has the smallest share (2.06%). Moreover, the provinces with bigger saving shares are mostly concentrated in Northeast China region and Northwest China region. This can provide references for the selection of provinces to pilot the economic dispatch reform, this is because the provinces with higher saving shares will show more enthusiasm for supporting the dispatch reform. In addition, we have compared our results with previous studies in Table 2, which can prove the robustness of our results.

If the economic dispatch scope is enlarged from provincial level to regional grid level, the coal savings and their shares are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in this ﬁgure, the total coal savings from regional economic dispatch will be reduced to 45.89 Mtce. This is because the great coal price differences among different provinces will inﬂuence the economic dispatch results (see Fig. 6). For example, the average annual coal price in Jiangxi is 3.30 times than that of Xinjiang. Moreover, the heat rate differences are not signiﬁcant when compared with the coal price differences in some provinces. Therefore, some less efﬁcient generation units may get more running time due to their lower coal prices. 8 From the perspective of absolute coal savings, North China grid region has the largest conservation potential (13.82 Mtce), while the South China grid region has the smallest conservation potential (4.76 Mtce). This result can be served as a justiﬁcation for building more transmission lines within certain regional grids to achieve the energy saving potential. From the perspective of the share of coal savings, Northwest grid region has the biggest share of coal savings (5.90%), while the South China region has the smallest share of coal savings (3.35%). This can also provide references for the selection of places to conduct the pilot regional economic dispatch.

At last, if the economic dispatch is further expanded to the national level, the total coal conservation would be 43.40 Mtce. It is interesting to ﬁnd out that less energy conservation potentials will be achieved if the dispatch scope becomes bigger, so the coal price is an important factor that affects the energy saving potentials.

In addition, we have also calculated the energy efﬁcient dispatch savings at different geographical levels, which are shown in Fig. 7. These results can be served as a good comparison for the economic dispatch results. The energy efﬁcient dispatch has been implemented in ﬁve pilot provinces (Guangdong, Guizhou, Henan, Jiangsu, Sichuan). Under the energy efﬁcient dispatch rule, the coal generators are dispatched basing on their generation efﬁciency (heat rates), and the ones with higher efﬁciency performance will have the priority to be dispatched ﬁrst. Moreover, the coal price information will not inﬂuence the dispatch decision under this rule. In contrast to the economic dispatch, the amount of energy savings from energy efﬁcient dispatch increases when the dispatch scope enlarges. Compared with the provincial efﬁcient dispatch, the regional energy efﬁcient dispatch will get further 2.01 Mtce coal savings, among which the Northwest China grid region gets the largest additions (0.55 Mtce). The total amount of energy savings from a national energy efﬁcient dispatch is 78.27 Mtce, which equals to 6.19% of the national coal used for electricity generation in 2014.

4.3. Political and economic challenges of electricity dispatch reform

Reforming the dispatch rule of Chinese power sector has been under debate for a long time, and some provinces have piloted in implementing energy efﬁcient dispatch since 2007. However, the original ‘equal share’ dispatch mode is still active for most places in China now. There are some political and economic challenges to change the current dispatch mode to economic dispatch, which are identiﬁed as below.

The ﬁrst major challenge is that the dispatch reform will induce the beneﬁts re-allocation among generators of different ownership types, thus affecting the provincial economic dispatch. The coal generation units are owned by three types of companies in China, namely the state-owned companies, the local government or investors owned companies, and the foreign investor owned companies. Under the current regulation regime, the generation income of state-owned companies is under the charge of State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), which contributes little to the local ﬁscal income. However, the generation income of the remaining two types is closely related to the ﬁscal income of the local government. Therefore, the coal generation companies will persuade their closely related government to ﬁght for more running time for them, because this is a win-win game for them. At last, it will increase the tensions between the central government and local government.

Fig. 8 illustrates this political economy challenge, the X axis exhibits the share of total installed capacity related to the local government within one province. The smaller the share is, the weaker its persuasive ability is. The Y axis shows the heat rate differences between the local government related generators and central government related generators, which indicates the tension intensity between them. The bubble size illustrates the amount of total installed coal capacity within one province.

In most provinces, the heat rates of central government related generators are lower than that of the local government related ones, the ﬁve exceptions are Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, Beijing, Guizhou, Xinjiang and Gansu, which are highlighted in blue in Fig. 8. This means that the implementation of economic dispatch will reduce the ﬁscal income of the local government, while increase the ﬁscal income of the central government. Additionally, the promotion opportunities of the top leaders and the salary of the people who work in the local generation companies will be affected. Note as well that many provinces have a local government involved share over 20%. For example, the share of local government related capacity in Guangdong is more than 50%, which indicates that it has enough motivations to bargain with the central government in setting the operation time quotas. Therefore, the political economy impacts resulting from economic dispatch should not be easily ignored (Kahrl et al., 2013; Robinson and Li, 2017).

The second major challenge is that the over-supply of provincial coal-ﬁred power will hinder cross-border trading among different provinces, thus affecting the implementation of economic dispatch in a

regional level. The payment per kWh received by the coal generators are set the NDRC in China, which is calculated based on the long run system costs and the lifetime of the benchmark generators. Therefore, the main incentive for the coal generator's investment is the annual operation time, which is allocated under the equal share dispatch rule. The allocated running time is quite proﬁtable for coal generators when the supply-demand is very tight previously, so coal generators were invested heavily during the past decades, leading an overinvestment status at present. Fig. 9 shows the current over-supply of coal generation in China. Yunnan has the highest surplus ratio (69%) of coal generation, while Beijing has the lowest surplus ratio (16%). Based on this surplus generation, the excessive coal capacity in different provinces could be calculated and shown in Fig. 10, Henan has the largest overcapacity of coal generators (31.4 GW), while Beijing has the smallest overcapacity of coal generators (0.4 GW). In addition, the total national overcapacity of coal generators is 342.9 GW, representing 41% of total coal capacity in China.

Moreover, the income from power generation within one province is directly related to its ﬁscal income, which is not only important for its economic development, but also an important indicator for measuring the top leaders' political performance. No province wants their cake to be eaten by others (Kahrl et al., 2013), the amount of generation changes brought by regional (national) economic dispatch can be seen from Fig. 11 (Fig. 12). Some provinces' beneﬁts from generation will be largely reduced if economic dispatch is implemented in a regional grid level, such as Shandong and Anhui. Accordingly, even though there may be some energy saving potentials from economic dispatch in wider areas, there is still some political and economic obstacles to move this step forward. This can also be proved by the current limited share of interprovincial electricity trading in China (16% in 2014). Moreover, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) holds a share of 13% (Kahrl et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2016).9 

The third major challenge is the current insufﬁcient running hours for most generators to recover their huge sunk investment cost, thus inﬂuencing the implementation of economic dispatch in a national level. Investing into the coal-ﬁred power plants is a capital intensive business, once the construction is ﬁnished, the generation units would need certain amount of running hours to recover their cost (Gao and Yang, 2010; Ma and He, 2008). The break-even running time of the coal-ﬁred power plants in China is about 5500 h per year, 10 which is above all the average running time of the generators with different capacity sizes (see Fig. 13). Moreover, according to the current feed-intariffs rule, the coal generators will only be paid if not constrained off, so they could not achieve adequate earnings as what has been expected currently.

Therefore, there is a great tendency of protest for the dispatch reform since many generators already have difﬁculties in recovering their investment cost. No generation unit would like to reduce their running time without any relevant compensation. Moreover, this situation is faced by almost all the coal generators in China, so a dispatch reform that affects the beneﬁts of most players will in general have difﬁculty in its implementation.

5. Conclusion and policy implications

5.1. Conclusion

The current equal share dispatch approach has been criticized for its negative inﬂuences on the security, environmental sustainability and affordability of Chinese electricity sector. Reforming the dispatch rule may be a good choice to address these challenges. To provide references for the cost-beneﬁt analysis of the on-going electricity market reform, this study pioneers in quantifying the economic dispatch savings in Chinese coal-ﬁred power sector. The heat rates of all the coal generators in China have been estimated, based on which we prove the necessity for economic dispatch. Then, an optimization model has been employed to calculate the energy saving potentials from economic dispatch in provincial, regional and national levels. At last, three main political and economic challenges to change the current dispatch mode to economic dispatch have been identiﬁed. During this process, some major conclusions are drawn as follows:

(1) The heat rates of 2803 coal generators in China range from

273.91 gce/kWh to 348.38 gce/kWh in 2014, and great differences exist among these generators at different geographical levels. This indicates that energy saving potential could be achieved if economic dispatch is implemented in the electricity system. Moreover, the fact that the negative correlations between the generator efﬁciencies and their allocated annual running time do exist in some provinces, which further proves the necessity for economic dispatch.

(2) 5.67% of the coal used for power generation could be saved from provincial economic dispatch in 2014. The provinces with bigger saving shares are mostly concentrated in Northeast China region and Northwest China region. Moreover, the beneﬁts saved from coal could bring down the electricity price by about 1–2% in 2014. Due to the great coal price differences among different provinces, the saved 71.78 Mtce coal from provincial economic dispatch will be reduced to

45.89 Mtce (regional) and 43.40 Mtce (national) when the dispatch scope enlarges. However, the energy savings from energy efﬁcient dispatch increase as the dispatch area expands, and 78.27 Mtce of coal in total could be conserved from the national energy efﬁcient dispatch.

(3) The transition from current dispatch mode to the economic dispatch faces several major political and economic challenges. The differences in the heat rates of generators with different ownership types would hinder the implementation of economic dispatch in a provincial level, this is because beneﬁts of re-allocation among different ownership types will induce the tensions between central government and local government. The over-supply status of coal-ﬁred power in all provinces impedes the implementation of economic dispatch in a regional level, since provinces are reluctant to import electricity from their neighbors via regional dispatch,

which will reduce their own ﬁscal income and development opportunities. Moreover, the current insufﬁcient running hours for cost recovery hinders the implementation of economic dispatch in a national level, and no generation unit wants his piece of cake to be eaten by others without any compensation. Consequently, transition and compensation mechanisms should be established when implementing the economic dispatch in China.

5.2. Policy implications

Based on the conclusions obtained above, some policy implications are proposed as follows:

(1) To achieve the coal saving potential and drive down the operational costs in China's electricity sector, it is necessary to establish a well-function wholesale market to implement the economic dispatch rule (Pollitt et al., 2017). Since the new wave of electricity market reform started in 2015, several provinces have been piloting in establishing wholesale forward markets, such as Zhejiang and Guangdong. Considering importance and complexity of electricity markets, Chinese pilot projects should on the one hand drawn successful experiences from countries like UK and US, they should on the other hand consider the unique characteristic of Chinese politics and economy.

(2) For the better implementation of economic dispatch in Chinese electricity system, it is necessary to analyze the distributional implications for different types of stakeholders, and establish relevant compensation mechanism if it is necessary (Pollitt et al., 2017). Moreover, reforming the dispatch rule in the electricity system is a complex and somewhat unpredictable issue, and it takes time to achieve the intended good outcome (Pollitt et al., 2017). Therefore, it is meaningful to establish appropriate transition mechanisms for the transition of dispatch rule.

(3) Even though the total energy saving potentials may be reduced due to the coal price differences, more economic beneﬁts can be achieved from bigger economic dispatch areas. To achieve these economic returns from wider dispatch areas, we should ﬁrstly optimize the dispatch of the existing generators and

power lines ﬁrst, and then rationalise the investment of new generators and lines. Apart from this, it is also important to develop a proper mechanism to allocate the beneﬁts from cross-border trading. Taken the experience in US as an example, the cost savings or extra revenues are typically split by 50/50 between different involved entities (Hurlbut et al., 2017).

(4) Under the current power operation regime in China, the power grid companies are in charge of the actual generator dispatch, and the consumers are the rate-payers who bear the power generation cost. Without any change in the pricing mechanism, the energy economic dispatch reform is simply an income transfer among these generation companies, which is the major reason why the energy efﬁcient dispatch has failed in the piloting provinces. Therefore, it will be better to establish a cost reﬂective mechanism of the ﬁnal retail prices, then the beneﬁts of the lower overall system cost will be received by both the grid companies and rate-payers. UK has accumulated good electricity market reform experiences and its electricity pricing mechanism are cost reﬂective and encourages innovation among all the related stakeholders (Newbery, 2016; Strbac et al., 2014).

(5) The government should make the dispatch rule more transparent and improve the data availability of electricity system operation, thus more valuable researches could be done to support the decisions in the current electricity market reform. Moreover, the disclosure of dispatch information can provide good investment signals for the stakeholders and help them making wiser decisions, such as avoiding the over investment of current generation capacity (Pollitt et al., 2017). Many countries have made the information of their electricity dispatch system available to the public, such as the UK, US and Australia etc.11 

Although we have answered several important questions related to the economic dispatch in Chinese coal-ﬁred power sector, some issues are still needed for further improvement. The economic dispatch model could be improved to be closer to the real system operation. For example, the constraints of transmission capacity between different regions, ramp up and down rates and the line losses could be added to the model when the new data is available. In addition, an economic dispatch model for the whole electricity sector could be developed to provide more references for the dispatch reform."
15,Economic evaluation of Chinese electricity price marketization based on dynamic computational general equilibrium model,"The Chinese government has accelerated the pace of electricity market reform in recent years. The primary objective is to create a market-oriented electricity price which can accurately reflect the relationship between market supply and demand, resource scarcity, and the cost of environmental damages. This study adopted a dynamic computational general equilibrium model of China (CDECGE) to conduct quantitative assessment of the economic impact of Chinese electricity market reform. As abatement policies may affect electricity price significantly, the carbon intensity reduction targets for China in 2020 and 2030 were also accounted for during simulation. The results show that reform is indeed beneficial in terms of energy savings and reduction of carbon emissions. Compared to results under regular electricity price, the total primary energy consumed from 2016 to 2030 under market-oriented electricity price will decrease by 5.01%, while the accumulated carbon emission will decrease by 4.70%. The marketization of electricity price also benefits reduced abatement costs in China, where the accumulated GDP from 2016 to 2030 would be about 1012.80 trillion RMB (an increase of nearly 0.25%) compared to that under regulated electricity price. We also found that the economic cost of electricity market intervention is very high for China, as it would force the government to pay expensive subsidies to keep the price of electricity at a relatively low level. Marketization reform may also exacerbate inflation, although it not to any substantial degree. The findings altogether demonstrate that electricity price marketization may result in multiple economic benefits; the results presented here also may provide a useful reference for Chinese market reform policies in future.","1. Background

The electricity industry is one of the fundamental components of any national economy, as it concerns energy safety, economic development, and social stability. For a lengthy portion of its history, China regarded electric power resources as a ‘‘quasi-public good”, under which concept the price of electricity was regulated by the state. However, price distortions in the electricity industry have become increasingly severe precisely because of the ‘‘quasipublic good”, as the price of electricity cannot effectively reﬂect the generating cost, causing power generation enterprises to suffer losses accordingly. Since 2002, especially, China has been faced with widespread power shortages (Ye, Yuan, Li, & Li, 2014). In effort to stabilize the electricity industry and relieve the shortage of resources, China has attempted to limit electricity usage and/or increase prices, but these methods have generated adverse effects on economic and social development. Reforming the electricity market, regulating resource allocation, setting prices appropriately to reﬂect consumption costs, the relationship between market supply and demand, the degree of resource scarcity, and potential threats posed by the industry to the environment are all major – and urgent – concerns of ofﬁcials and decisionmakers tasked with enabling the electricity industry to better serve economic and social development in China.

In March 2015, the State Council of China published Several Opinions on Further Deepening Electricity System Reform, a document that proposed several changes to the electricity industry by insisting that market-oriented reform, including an electricity pricing mechanism which can adapt to market requirements, is the best way to move forward in China’s current economic context (The State Council of China, 2015). Electricity price reform concerns energy safety in general and relates to a fundamental quality-of-life issue, as well as the overall economic and social development of Chinese society as a whole. Accurate assessment of the economic effects of electricity price marketization reform, especially in regard to price ﬂuctuations on the transmission mechanism in China’s macro-economy and relevant, feasible policy suggestions, is of crucial practical signiﬁcance in the current and future electricity market.

Electricity market reform began in China in the 1980s, and can be roughly divided into ﬁve stages. The ﬁrst stage, prior to 1985, took place during a period of economic planning: the electricity industry implemented an operation mode integrating generation, transmission, distribution, and sales, and the state implemented mandatory electricity price, thus, the degree of electricity marketization degree was quite low (Wang & Chen, 2012). The second stage took place during the reform period (1985–1997), when the RCI (repayment of principal and interest) pricing method was implemented. At that time, the country implemented coexisting policies for electricity price and mandatory electricity price, then gradually introduced the RCI feed-in tariff (Zhao, Lyon, & Song, 2012). The third stage was characterized by operation period price reform (1998–2002). To encourage enterprises to reduce their costs, the government also revised the RCI pricing policy and introduced the operation period price policy (Zhao et al., 2012). The fourth stage took place after the separation of plants and the grid in 2003, the year that the Electricity System Report Scheme proposed a reform policy of ‘‘separation of plant and grid, separation of primary and secondary subject, separation of transmission and distribution, and competitive communication”. The policy explicitly divided the price of electricity into four individual price points: generation, transmission, distribution, and sales (Wang & Chen, 2012). The ﬁfth and current stage has been underway since 2015, the year that Several Opinions on Further Deepening Electricity System Reform was published by the State Council, proposing that China should orderly enact electricity price reform, rationalize the electricity price formation mechanism, encourage competitive electricity prices, separate transmission-distribution price from generation-selling price as far as formation mechanisms, bolster the electricity transaction system, and improve the marketoriented transaction mechanism. In summary, China has conducted multiple highly effective reforms to its electricity industry. Although electricity price marketization has not yet been fully realized, the reform orientation and determination of the Chinese government in regard to marketization and general improvement have been steadfast.

This study focused on internal motivations for economic development to conduct a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the economic inﬂuence of Chinese electricity market reform via the China Dynamic Energy Computable General Equilibrium (CDECGE) model. More speciﬁcally, we studied the inﬂuence of different electricity price formulation mechanisms on economic growth, energy demand, and carbon emissions in China in the future. In fact, because emission reduction is a factor signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing electricity consumption, to lend our analysis the most practical signiﬁcance possible, we set our primary objective as the potential inﬂuence of electricity price marketization on carbon intensity reduction mandates in China in 2020 and 2030.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is the literature review, Section 3 introduces the features of the CDECGE model, Section 4 provides details regarding the speciﬁc context of this study and our analysis process, Section 5 presents our results, and Section 6 contains relevant policy suggestions and a brief conclusion.

2. Literature review

The key component of electricity market reform is electricity price reform. The inﬂuence of price ﬂuctuations on the

macro-economy has proven problematic and uncertain in academic circles in China and abroad. According to our review of the existing literature, we ﬁnd that related studies can be roughly divided into two categories. The ﬁrst category includes works by scholars who insist that increasing electricity prices drive inﬂation, i.e., increasing price levels. For example, Lin (2006) conducted a questionnaire survey with 900 Chinese industrial enterprises, then analyzed the inﬂuence of rising electricity prices on outputs of different industries and social levels by establishing a transcendental logarithmic model to ﬁnd that industrial enterprises are more sensitive to electricity price, and that increased electricity price would improve inﬂation level. Nguyen (2008) conducted a similar analysis in Vietnam and found that if the electricity price was increased and set as the cost of long-term marginal production, most commodity prices would notably increase but the total price level passed on to society would remain fairly stable. Akkemik (2011) analyzed the potential inﬂuence of rising electricity prices on Turkey’s national economy via social accounting matrix price model and found that electricity price ﬂuctuation has caused producer and consumer prices to rise, impacting the country’s economic development and consumption. Song (2011) measured and calculated the relation between Chinese electricity price and total price level with an input–output table and found that small increases in electricity price would not overly exacerbate the level of inﬂation.

The second category includes works by scholars who assert that the inﬂuence of rising electricity prices on economic output is the most important factor of electricity market reform. Some believe that increasing electricity price would reduce outputs and increase unemployment – for example, Patrick, Blandford, and Peters (2015) estimated the elasticity of American electricity price through a ﬁxed-assets model and found that if the nominal electricity price was increased by 10%, America would lose one million jobs and see a drop in GDP by 142 billion USD. Cox, Peichl, Pestelet, and Siegloch (2014) estimated the cross-price elasticity between manufacturing sector electricity consumption and the heterogeneous labor in Germany, and found that the Renewable Energy Act of 2014 decreased the country’s labor demand in the manufacturing sector by 1.4%. Kwon, Cho, Robertset, Kim, and Yu (2015) studied the relationships among power demand, economic output, and electricity price in Korea via generalized two-stage least square model and found that if the electricity price was increased by 2% each year, the output of the manufacturing industry of Korea would drop 4.5% between 2013 and 2022.

Conversely, other scholars insist that rising electricity prices would promote economic development in the long run. For example, Faisal and Ahmad (2010) analyzed the inﬂuence of electricity price reform in Pakistan and found that electricity price increase would not damage the real economy but would improve the operation conditions of power enterprises. He et al. (2015) studied the dynamic inﬂuence of electricity price ﬂuctuation on the Chinese economy and found that relatively low electricity prices in the country seem beneﬁcial to economic development, but will damage the positive correlation with economic development in the long run. Ye, Yuan, and Li (2013) performed a regression analysis on average electricity price and economic development data of east-central-west regions of China from 2000 to 2010, and found that China may fall into a ‘‘trap” formed by low electricity prices characterized by only short-term social beneﬁts resulting from low prices. In short, in the long run, the electricity price level of China is in positive correlation with economic development level. Low electricity price policies beneﬁt economic development in the short term, but may be harmful in terms of industrial structure adjustment and economic growth pattern transitions, thus actually harming the long-term development of China’s economy (Ye et al., 2014).

The researchers mentioned above all adopted classical econometric models to conduct their respective studies. To study electricity price ﬂuctuation’s impact on the macro-economy, parts of the equation are normally isolated and examined separately from the whole economic system. To this effect, only changes in local variables are observed while other parts are assumed to be unchanged, thus failing to reﬂect real-world conditions. As a notable departure from traditional measurement models, the Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) model describes the relationship of interdependency and interaction among different departments on the basis of economic theories; the research and analysis objects of the CGE model cover a country’s entire economic system comprehensively. In the supply chain described by the CGE model, it does not matter which mode changes or if any external impact or ﬂuctuations in policy occur, any factor related to supply and decision of the economic subject will transmit its inﬂuence and affect the entire economic system according to the optimal decision behavior of the economic subject. In other words, any slight move in one part affects the situation as a whole. Research projects which introduce the CGE model into the electricity problem have emerged in academic circles only within the past few years. Li, Wang, Zhang, and Kou (2014), for example, adopted the CGE model to assess the inﬂuence of carbon emissions permit trading on the Chinese economy under regulated electricity price, and Hwang and Lee (2015) established a static CGE model for the Korean economy and analyzed the inﬂuence of electricity market reform accordingly.

Overall, although many scholars focus on the impacts of electricity price ﬂuctuation on the economy, most studies are conducted based on classic econometric models, the relationship of interdependency and interaction among different economic units haven’t been well considered. Several recent researches have adopted the CGE models to analyze the effects of electricity price ﬂuctuations, which mainly focused on the short-term effects and only some representative indexes have been discussed, and there are seldom researches about the long-term effects of Chinese electricity price marketization. At present, Chinese government is at a critical stage of promoting the reform of the electricity market, it is necessary to adopt appropriate tools to give a comprehensive evaluation for the policy makers.

3. China Dynamic Energy Computable General Equilibrium (CDECGE) model

3.1. Main features of CDECGE model

The China Dynamic Energy Computable General Equilibrium (CDECGE) model was developed by the Energy-environment Policy Research Center of Institute of Policy and Management, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is widely used to analyze problems related to energy, environment, and economic policies in China (Bi, Fan, Cai, & Xia, 2013; Cui, Fan, Zhu, & Bi, 2014; Cui, Fan, Zhu, Bi, & Zhang, 2013). Compared to traditional CGE models, the CDECGE model is set apart by a few prominent features. First, a technical change parameter is introduced in the production function of the model to reﬂect the inﬂuence of technical progress on product production and departmental capital, simultaneously describing ﬂuctuations in consumer preference. Second, in regard to processing dynamic investment decision behaviors, the model connects the growth rate of capital stock with investment and expected rate of return, reﬂecting investment intentions through said returns and further reﬂecting the accumulation of capital stock in the industry. Third, the model assumes that the mobility of labor among relevant departments is inﬂuenced by two important factors: the relative rate of wages and relative employment situations among departments. In other words, wage adjustments under the CDECGE model do not result in labor market clearing

of the current period – instead, a more reasonable assumption is adopted so that when external impact occurs, wages are adjusted gradually. Finally, the impact is absorbed by gradual wage changes to form complete adjustment to the labor market and reach a new balance accordingly (Mai et al., 2010; Bi et al., 2013).

This model is comprised of three main input elements (labor, capital, and land) and six economic factors (enterprise, inhabitant, government, investment, export, and inventory). The equation system is mainly comprised of a demand equation for producer investment in intermediate products and basic factors, an inhabitant consumption equation, an import and export trade equation, a government expenditure equation, a commodity market and factor market clearing equation, a macro-economic index equation, and a price index equation.

3.2. CDECGE model production module

The production function of the CDECGE model encompasses the production structure and input structure of the model. As far as production input, the same domestic and imported products are combined into composite products according to the CES function, and all factors (capital, labor, and land) are combined into basic factors according to the production function of the CES function, then the enterprise conducts the production of all intermediate inputs, basic factors, and other costs according to Leontief production function standards. The energies, energy, and factors cannot replace each other, which is inconsistent with real-world conditions, so we revised the production function by combining six fossil energies (coal, petroleum, natural gas, petroleum products, coke, and fuel gas) into a fossil energy beam related to CES; electricity products were then also integrated into the energy beam, and ﬁnally, the energy factors and non-energy products altogether satisﬁed the Leontief production function. In this way, mutual replacement among energies and between energy and factors was achieved.

In the CDECGE model, the production function is composed of four layers of nests. A substitution relation between energy input and each factor is introduced in the representation of production behavior. The speciﬁc structure of the production function is depicted in Fig. 1.

3.3. CDECGE model consumption module

The income and expenditure conditions of economic subjects (inhabitants, government, and enterprises) in the CDECGE model, according to national economic accounting principles, are very important to consider. The remunerations paid by the production sector for labor and capital constitute the income factor; the distribution of the income factor to inhabitants and enterprises constitutes its primary distribution. Inhabitants and enterprises transmit income into consumption and savings after paying the taxes to the government, while the government uses income from various taxes collected from inhabitants and enterprises, deducts the portion transferred back to inhabitants and enterprises, and utilizes the remainder for consumption and savings on the part of the state. It is assumed in the CDECGE that in the primary distribution of the income factor, all labor-related income is obtained by the inhabitants, while capital incomes are obtained by the enterprises, inhabitants, and foreign parties.

3.3.1. Enterprises Enterprises receive income from capital returns and payment transferred by the government; enterprise expenditures include payments to inhabitants and taxes. The CDECGE model assumes that the parameter of payment transferred to inhabitants by enterprises and tax rates are ﬁxed.

where EnSav refers to enterprise savings, GtoEn to payment transferred from the government to the enterprise, EnTax to taxes paid, EntoH to payment transferred to inhabitants, K_e to the distribution coefﬁcient of capital income against enterprises (an exogenous variable), and YK i to the capital return of the ith sector.

where H i refers to inhabitant consumption of the ith commodity, BN i to basic demand for commodity i, b i to the marginal propensity to consume, and YD to inhabitants’ disposable incomes.

where E_h refers to payment transferred from the enterprise to inhabitants and Etax to the rate of taxes paid by the enterprise to the government.

3.3.2. Inhabitants Inhabitants receive income based on labor remuneration, capital returns, and payment transferred from the government, enterprises, and other institutions. Inhabitant expenditures include the consumption of various commodities and taxes paid to the government.

3.3.3. Government The government’s recurring income comes from production taxes, tariffs, inhabitant income taxes, taxes paid by enterprises, and payment transferred from other areas in the world; recurrent government expenditures include various commodities, payment transferred to inhabitants, payment transferred to enterprises, and export subsidies. Government savings are the value of the difference between income and expenditures, and deﬁcit is allowed.

where GR is the government’s recurring income, IndTax is indirect taxes and dues of enterprise production, Tariff is import tariffs imposed by the government, HTax is inhabitant income tax, EnTax is enterprise income tax, and WtoG is payment transferred to the government from other parts of the world. The speciﬁc calculation formulas for each tax are as follows:

where YL i refers to the labor remuneration of the ith sector; K_h to the distribution coefﬁcient of capital income against inhabitants (an exogenous variable), EntoH to payment transferred from enterprises to inhabitants, GtoH to payment transferred from the government to inhabitants, and WtoH to payment transferred from other parts of the world to inhabitants. Inhabitant savings satisfy the following equation:

where HSav is inhabitant savings, mps is the marginal propensity of inhabitants to save, and htax are taxes paid by inhabitants to the government. The demand of inhabitants for various commodities satisﬁes the extended liner expenditure system (ELES):

where tax i is the rate of indirect enterprise taxes, mtax i is the rate of import tariffs, PWM i refers to world import price of commodity i (an exogenous variable,) ER is the exchange rate, and M i is the import volume of commodity i. Government savings satisfy the following:


where GSav is government savings, GtoEn is payment transferred from the government to enterprises, GtoH is payment transferred from the government to inhabitants, ExSub is export subsidies, and GdTot is the total consumption expenditures of the government for various commodities. Speciﬁcally, where G_en, G_h, and G_c respectively refer to parameters of demand preference of the government to enterprises, government to inhabitants, and government to ﬁnal products, which are all exogenous variables. Export subsidies satisfy the following:

ExSub ¼

X

esub i Ã PE i Ã Ei 

ð15Þ

where PE i is the domestic export price of the ith commodity, E i is domestic export volume of the ith commodity, and esub i is export subsidy rate of the government for the ith commodity.

where r ¼ 1=ð1 À qÞ, which refers to the substitution parameter of imported products and domestic products. Import trade adopts the ‘‘small country” assumption, namely, that the prices of world commodities imported by China are exogenous, and that China is only the accepter of the prices but cannot inﬂuence the prices of world commodities.

i

PM i ¼ PWM i Ã ð1 þ mtax i Þ Ã ER

ð18Þ

where PWM i is the world price of the ith imported commodity, which is extraneous and given.

3.4. Import and export trade module of CDECGE model

Fig. 2 describes the ﬂow direction of commodities throughout the entire economy, which can be roughly divided into three stages. The ﬁrst stage is the Armington integration of domestic products and imported products, which represents commodity supply. The second stage is where domestic production sectors purchase the intermediate input products to produce products, which represents the use and consumption of commodities. In the third stage, domestic producers choose to distribute sales at certain volume in domestic and overseas markets so as to maximize proﬁts.

In Fig. 2, D i refers to the sales volume of the ith commodity produced and sold domestically, PD i is the price of the ith commodity which was produced and sold domestically, M i is the sales volume of the ith imported commodity, PM i is the domestic price of the ith imported commodity, Q i is the sales volume of i types of integrated commodities which are sold domestically, PQ i is the price of the integrated commodities, X i is the domestic yield of the ith commodity, PX i is the domestic output price of the ith commodity, Ei  is the export volume of the ith commodity, and PE i is the FOB of the ith exported product.

3.4.1. Imports Commodities which are sold domestically mainly come from two sources: domestic production, and imports. The CDECGE model mimics other related models by assuming that imported products and domestic products are not totally interchangeable. In other words, domestic consumers choose the optimal consumption ratio between domestic products and imported products when purchasing either type of commodity so as to minimize costs. See the following equation:

After the above planning problem is solved, the following expression can be obtained:

3.4.2. Exports The ﬂow direction of domestically produced products is twofold: ﬁrst, domestic sales, and second, exported goods. Similar to that of imports, the CDECGE model assumes that these two kinds of products are not fully interchangeable. Producers of domestic products choose an optimal sales ratio between the two products (i.e., CET function.)

It should be noted that as opposed to the traditional CES function, in the CET function, s > 1. It can be obtained by solving the above planning problem.


where d ¼ 1=ðs À 1Þ, which refers to the substitution parameter of imported products and domestic products. The export demand module assumes that export demand is a downward-sloping curve of ﬁxed price elasticity, which can be inﬁnite for the small amount of commodities supplied by China to the world market. That is to say, export variation in China is not sufﬁcient to inﬂuence world supply or affect the world market. For the large amount of commodities exported by China, the ﬁxed elasticity of export demand is limited, thus:

where PE i is the export price, E i is the export volume, r i 4 is the ﬁxed price elasticity of export demand, ER is the nominal exchange rate, and FQ i and FP respectively refer to the transferring variables of export volume (calculated in USD) and world average price, which reﬂect export demand variations caused by the two types of factors mentioned above. As such, the price of export products is reﬂected as decided by domestic production costs, export encouragement policies, and exchange rate ﬂuctuations endogenously.

3.5. Dynamic mechanism of CDECGE model

While processing dynamic investment decision behaviors, the CDECGE model connects the growth rate of capital stock with investment and expected rate of return, plus the inﬂuence of investment intentions through said expected rate of return, then represents the accumulated impact of capital stock of the industry. The following are dynamic equations for capital accumulation in the model.

where j is the industry, K is capital, D is capital depreciation rate, Et  is the value of expectation of period t, and ROR is the capital return rate. KGR j,t refers to capital growth rate, P j;t ð2Þ is the cost for addition-

parameters of the model were calibrated, and 2016 to 2030 as the prediction period. All data including investment, consumption, import and export, population, employment, exchange rate, and GDP price index in the history calibration period came from the China Statistical Yearbook 2014 (NBSC, 2014a). Energy production volume, import volume, export volume, and inhabitant consumption volume of each variety also came from the China Statistical Yearbook 2014 (NBSC, 2014b). Emission factors of various primary energies came from the IPCC (2006) Report; employment and population data of China under the baseline scenario in the future came from the UNDP (2013) Report. The industrial sector as a whole was divided in the input–output table into 138 individual industrial sectors, seven of which are energy production sectors: coal mining and washing, oil exploitation, natural gas exploitation, petroleum and nuclear fuel processing, coking, production and supply of electricity and heating power, and production and supply of fuel gas.

4. Policy scenario

ally increasing one unit of capital, P j;t ð1capÞ is the rate of capital rent, r is the interest rate, and INF is the inﬂation rate.

Investment demand in the model is decided by predicted return-on-investment rate, while the predicted return-oninvestment rate is decided by the rent of the subsequent period, the capital price of the current period and the subsequent period, inﬂation rate, and interest rate. Capital supply is represented by the function which takes the capital growth rate as the predicted return-on-investment rate, and capital accumulation is determined by deducting investment depreciation so as to ensure capital supply. Capital demand is determined by the marginal income of each sector. Capital supply interacts with capital demand so as to reach a new balance and further obtain the capital of the subsequent period. The CDECGE model adopts the yearly recursive dynamic mechanism and connects economic operations of different years by recursive dynamics of capital accumulation, ensuring dynamic development in the model.

3.6. CDECGE model simulation of electricity price control

In China, electricity is an important object of government regulation. To control the price of electricity, the Chinese government has introduced a ‘‘soft budget constraint” mechanism for power generation enterprises (Qian & Roland, 1996). When the regulated electricity price is lower than the generation cost, the government does not directly give subsidies to power generation enterprises but instead makes up for rising costs by reducing the cost of other links to the enterprises, for example, by implementing tax deductions and exemptions or providing loans at low interest to the enterprises (Li et al., 2014). In the CDECGE model, it is assumed (similarly to other models) that the government adjusts electricity price according to the cost of power generation enterprises through tax deduction and exemption (Li et al., 2014; Vincent, Dixon, Parmenter, & Sams, 1979). Under this assumption, electricity price is set as exogenous variable and production taxes related to power generation enterprises are set as an endogenous variable for the purposes of electricity price control simulation.

3.7. Data sources

We used the input–output table of 2002 as the base year, 2002 to 2014 is the history simulation period during which the

The simulation conducted in this study can be divided into history scenario simulation and policy scenario simulation. The history simulation period was 2002 to 2014, during which time macro-economic variables such as actual GDP, carbon emissions, and import and export trading were employed to calibrate the model; in other words, these variables were exogenous and set as actual change values. The ‘‘unexplainable” part (also referred to as ‘‘deviation”), of the model was determined by the endogenous of relevant offset variables. In the prediction period, opposite operations were applied to extrapolate the historical trend, and to reduce the nondeterminacy of economic growth and obtain a relatively accurate result, it was assumed that the policy simulation started in 2015 (in effect, in 2016, because 2015 was almost past at the time this study was being conducted,) and ends in 2030.

This paper mainly explores the policy scenario from two aspects: electricity price policy and emission reduction policy. It was assumed that the government maintains the electricity output price as unchanged by implementing tax deductions and exemptions for power generation enterprises; the original endogenous electricity price variable p1tot was changed to an exogenous variable, the original production tax variable delPTXRATE was set to be endogenous, and thus the lower the variable, the greater the subsidies for the electricity industry. The years 2020 and 2030 were considered most notable in regard to emission reduction policies, because the Chinese government has committed to decreasing carbon intensity by 40–45% in 2020 compared to 2005, and by 6065% in 2030 compared to 2005; we chose the average level as our research object, namely, 42.5% decrease in carbon intensity in 2020 and 62.5% decrease in 2030 compared to 2005. To achieve these two objectives, it was assumed that emission reduction policies (i.e., carbon taxes) had been adopted in China and that the carbon tax level would remain the same from 2016 to 2030.

Based on our research objectives, the policy scenario set distinguishes between different individual electricity price policies while accounting for the future impact of emission reduction policies. Four scenarios were selected as listed in Table 1. Scenarios 1 and 2 represent the baseline, respectively expressed as S00 and S01, and Scenarios 3 and 4 represent emission reduction scenarios, respectively expressed as S10 and S11.

More speciﬁcally, S00 refers to a scenario in which the government continues the regulated electricity price policy, and other macro-economic variables are extrapolated according to historical trends. The increased risk of downtrend Chinese economic growth is taken into consideration when setting the economic growth rate, thus proper adjustments were made based on previous research results (Chen, Yin, & Zhang, 2016; Li, Dong, Shangguan, & Hook, 2011; Zhou et al., 2013). It was assumed that the annual average GDP growth rate is 6.5% from 2016 to 2020, the annual average GDP growth rate is 5.5% from 2021 to 2025, and the annual average growth rate decreases to 4.5% as economic growth from 2026 to 2030 slows down. S01 also refers to a baseline scenario, but unlike S00, a ﬂoating electricity price policy was assumed to be adopted in which electricity price ﬂuctuates freely according to market conditions. In terms of economic growth, S01 is similar to S00. Although the Chinese economy is faced with severe downtrends, China will take a series of measures (including increasing investment and promoting consumption) to stimulate its economy so that economic growth can remain within a reasonable level.

Similar to the baseline scenario, the emission reduction policy scenario also divides different electricity price policies so as to make clear the respective inﬂuence of certain policies on energy conservation and emission reduction. Although S10 and S11 require that carbon intensity decrease 42.5% by 2020 and 62.5% by 2030 compared to 2005, the carbon tax levels of two scenarios differ due to differing electricity price policies. Multiple simulations were conducted through CDECGE to ﬁnd that the carbon tax level that must be collected to meet these goals from 2016 to 2020 in China is about 72.5 RMB/ton CO2 , and from 2021 to 2030 is about 320.5 RMB/ton CO 2 under S10; under S11, the necessary carbon tax levels are, respectively, 62.5 RMB/ton CO 2 and 246 RMB/ton CO2 . It is important to note that under all carbon tax scenarios, the actual GDP was set to be endogenous and was inﬂuenced by carbon tax policies.

5. Results

5.1. Accumulated macro-economic variables

Table 2 lists the accumulated variations of actual GDP, energy consumption, and carbon emissions of China in the future under the four policy scenarios. At ﬁrst, compared to free electricity price policy, regulated electricity price results in elevated energy consumption and carbon emissions without regard to carbon emission reduction objectives of 2020 and 2030. For instance, under S00, total energy consumption of China from 2016 to 2030 is 93.565 billion tons of standard coal and total CO 2 emission is 188.908 billion tons; while under S01, China’s total energy consumption is 88.875 billion tons of standard coal and total CO 2 emission is 180.036 billion tons. Compared to free electricity price policy, regulated electricity price causes energy consumption to increase 5.28% and carbon emission to increase 4.93%. In actuality, alongside economic growth, the cost of each raw material and labor will also rise, thus the electricity price will rise, and thus regulated electricity price will reduce the cost of energy utilization. Because the elasticity of substitution exists between energy and labor and production factors such as capital, under the constraint of cost minimization, economic subjects will reduce the demand of labor and capital and increase the input of energy products, while increased energy demand will bring about increased carbon emissions.

The energy demand and carbon emission of China are dually inﬂuenced by electricity price and emission reduction policies. For example, under S10, China’s total energy consumption from 2016 to 2020 is 81.099 billion tons of standard coal and total CO 2 emission is 139.598 billion tons; under S11, total energy consumption is 77.949 billion tons of standard coal and total CO2  emission is 137.148 billion tons. If the emission reduction target is considered, energy consumption will increase 4.04% and carbon emission will increase 1.71% under regulated electricity price as opposed to free electricity price.

As shown in Table 2, carbon taxes would excise negative impact on the economy. For example, from 2016 to 2030, accumulated GDP under S10 is 1010.30 trillion RMB, a decrease of 1.24% compared to that under S00; the accumulated GDP under S11 is 1012.80 trillion RMB, a decrease of 1.00% compared to that under S01. By comparison between S10 and S11, accumulated GDP under regulated electricity price decreases by 0.25% compared to that under free electricity price, therefore, the negative impact of emission reduction policy adopted under regulated electricity price on the economy is substantial. The main cause of this phenomenon is that regulated electricity price results in greater consumption of energy and carbon emissions than free electricity price. To achieve the same carbon insensitive reduction targets, higher carbon taxes should be adopted despite the risk of negative inﬂuence on the economy. In general, in terms of total variation, regulated electricity price will increase energy consumption level and carbon emissions, so more attention (and funds) should be given to emission reduction objectives.

5.2. Real GDP changes

The real GDP changes under all four policy scenarios are listed in Fig. 3. We found that the GDP growth rates in China prior to 2014 were the same under any scenario. This was also the result of model calibration, which required that the actual GDP growth rate be consistent with actual historical variation levels. If the carbon tax policy is not considered, actual GDP variation trends under S00 and under S01 would also be the same under the external constraint of growth, because GDP growth rate is exogenous. If carbon taxes are implemented, the economic aggregate of China will increase over previous years whether electricity price is ﬁxed or not, but the growth rate will slightly decline. The impact of carbon tax on China’s economy is sizeable when the policy is ﬁrst implemented, but the negative impact is gradually reduced with time. For example, under S10, the actual GDP of China in 2016 is 43.99 trillion RMB, which declines 1.60% compared to the same period under S00, while the decreasing amplitude is about 0.73% in 2020.

Although economy of China continually grows under different electricity price policies, the economic cost paid each year by China for emission reduction differs by scenario. Compared to the conditions under free electricity price, carbon tax collection under regulated electricity price causes more yearly GDP losses, which is related to relatively high carbon tax rate under regulated electricity price. As shown in Fig. 3, for example, the actual GDP of China in 2020 under S10 is 57.10 trillion RMB, which declines 0.73% compared to that under S00, while the actual GDP under S11 is 57.15 trillion RMB, which declines 0.62% compared to that under S01 so the decreasing amplitude of the latter is smaller than the former. Basically, compared to free electricity price, the existing regulated electricity price policy in China does not beneﬁt energy conservation or emission reduction, thus costing the country more to reduce emissions.

5.3. Energy consumption changes

As its economy grows, China’s energy consumption is increasing rapidly. The growth rate is inﬂuenced considerably by electricity price and emission reduction policies. As shown in Fig. 4, without regard to emission reduction measures, the primary energy consumption of China increases to 5.379 billion tons of standard coal in 2020 from 3.418 billion tons of standard coal in 2010 under regulated electricity price policy (S00), and that number reaches 8.280 billion tons of standard coal in 2030. Under this scenario, the economic development mode is extensive while efﬁciency of energy utilization is low, and therefore the energy demand is great while pressure on energy supply is excessive. If control of the electricity market is loosened and the electricity price freely ﬂuctuates, the energy consumption level of China in the future decreases considerably. Speciﬁcally, under S01, primary energy consumption increases to 5.278 billion tons of standard coal in 2020 from 3.418 billion tons of standard coal in 2010, and that number increases to 7.636 billion tons of standard coal in 2030. Compared to conditions under free electricity price, the energy demands in

2020 and 2030 under regulated electricity price policy respectively increase by 1.93% and 8.42%. Regulated electricity price restricts the possibility of future electricity price increases and reduces the cost of energy utilization, but because an alternative exists between production factors (such as labor, capital, and energy,) the input demand for energy is increased by the economic subject.

Implementing carbon taxes helps control the excessive growth of Chinese energy consumption, though the continuous growth trend of Chinese energy demand has not changed due to rampant industrialization and urbanization. If China continues to implement regulated electricity price policies, it needs to collect carbon tax at about 75.5 RMB/ton CO 2 from 2016 to 2020 to achieve the mandated

42.5% decrease in carbon intensity in 2020. The carbon tax level cannot be lower than 320.5 RMB/ton CO 2 from 2021 to 2030 to achieve the objective of 62.5% decrease in carbon intensity in 2030. Accordingly, the primary energy consumption of China will reach 5.051 billion tons of standard coal and 7.298 billion tons of standard coal in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Compared to the conditions under S00, total energy consumption under S01 respectively declines

6.10% and 11.86%, and thus the decreasing amplitude is large.

If the state does loosen its control of the electricity market, the electricity price will ﬂuctuate freely. To achieve 2020 and 2030 emission reduction goals, the carbon tax level from 2016 to 2020 cannot be lower than 62.5 RMB/ton CO2 , and the carbon tax level from 2021 to 2030 cannot be lower than 246.0 RMB/ton CO2 . Accordingly, total primary energy consumptions in 2020 and 2030 will be 4.997 billion tons of standard coal and 6.594 billion tons of standard coal, respectively. Compared to S01, implementing carbon tax makes energy consumption of 2020 and 2030 respectively decline by 5.32% and 13.65%, representing remarkable energy-saving effects. Fig. 4 shows where electricity price policy is also a critical factor related to China’s future energy demand, as the energy consumption under regulated electricity price will always be higher than that under free electricity price. For example, energy consumption in 2020 and 2030 increase by 1.08% and

10.68%, respectively, under S10 compared to S11.

Fig. 5 shows changes in China’s energy intensity under different policy scenarios. The energy intensity from 2002 to 2005 slightly rose, as energy consumption grew higher than the economy during that time. However, as technology progresses, the energy intensity of China will continue to decline. Similar to energy consumption, the energy intensity under S00 is consistently the highest of all scenarios; it decreases to 0.88 ton of standard coal/ten thousand RMB in 2030 from 1.02 ton of standard coal/ten thousand RMB in 2016, and at annual average decline of 1.01%. Electricity price marketization increases energy consumption cost, and due to energy-saving effect, the energy intensity of the entire country slightly declines. Speciﬁcally, the energy intensity of China under S01 decreases 0.81 ton of coal/ten thousand RMB in 2030 from 1.02 ton of coal/ten thousand RMB in 2016, and at annual average decline of 1.57%.

Future emission reduction policies are also an important factor to consider here, as they are closely related to variations in energy intensity. As shown in Fig. 5, carbon tax will bring about notable decline in energy intensity. Take S11 for example, under which energy intensity decreases to 0.70 ton of coal/ten thousand RMB in 2030 from 0.96 ton of coal/ten thousand RMB in 2016, and at annual average decline of 2.24%, the highest among the four scenarios. In general, energy intensity variations in China are inﬂuenced jointly by electricity price and emission reduction policies in the future, where marketization of electricity price and adoption of emission reduction policy will considerably reduce energy consumption intensity.
"
15,Economic evaluation of Chinese electricity price marketization based on dynamic computational general equilibrium model,"The Chinese government has accelerated the pace of electricity market reform in recent years. The primary objective is to create a market-oriented electricity price which can accurately reflect the relationship between market supply and demand, resource scarcity, and the cost of environmental damages. This study adopted a dynamic computational general equilibrium model of China (CDECGE) to conduct quantitative assessment of the economic impact of Chinese electricity market reform. As abatement policies may affect electricity price significantly, the carbon intensity reduction targets for China in 2020 and 2030 were also accounted for during simulation. The results show that reform is indeed beneficial in terms of energy savings and reduction of carbon emissions. Compared to results under regular electricity price, the total primary energy consumed from 2016 to 2030 under market-oriented electricity price will decrease by 5.01%, while the accumulated carbon emission will decrease by 4.70%. The marketization of electricity price also benefits reduced abatement costs in China, where the accumulated GDP from 2016 to 2030 would be about 1012.80 trillion RMB (an increase of nearly 0.25%) compared to that under regulated electricity price. We also found that the economic cost of electricity market intervention is very high for China, as it would force the government to pay expensive subsidies to keep the price of electricity at a relatively low level. Marketization reform may also exacerbate inflation, although it not to any substantial degree. The findings altogether demonstrate that electricity price marketization may result in multiple economic benefits; the results presented here also may provide a useful reference for Chinese market reform policies in future.","5.4. Energy consumption structure changes

Electricity price and emission reduction policies will have complicated and profound inﬂuence on the energy structure of China in the future. On one hand, after electricity price marketization, elec-

tricity price will rise along with rising costs of related factors such as raw materials and labor, therefore electricity demand will slow and the proportion of electricity as primary energy consumption will decline. On the other hand, carbon tax will promote lowcarbon energy consumption structures. High-carbon energies such as coal will be utilized less frequently while low-carbon and non-carbon energies such as natural gas and primary electricity are favored, thus the consumption share of electricity in primary energies will increase.

Fig. 6 describes China’s future energy consumption structure changes under different policy scenarios. First, if existing regulated electricity price policy is continued without regard to emission reduction measures (S00), electricity consumption maintains sustainable growth into the future. The consumption proportion of electricity in primary energies will continue to rise, and the share will increase to 23.08% in 2030 from 14.59% in 2016. In 2020, the consumption share of coal, oil, gas, and primary electricity are, respectively, 59.63%, 16.58%, 7.33%, and 16.46%, while in 2030, the consumption shares of the aforementioned four energies are 49.72%, 11.65%, 15.55%, and 23.08%. Under S00, the consumption proportions of coal and oil energies slightly decrease with time, while the proportions of gas and primary electricity slightly increase. Secondly, if the emission reduction measures are not considered but government control of the electricity market is loosened (S01), rising electricity price will drive down the growth rate of electricity demand and reduce the consumption proportion of electricity in primary energies. As shown in Fig. 6, the consumption share of primary electricity increases to 19.45% in 2030 from 14.68% in 2016, marking a slight decrease compared to the shares under S00. Under S01, the consumption share of coal, oil, gas, and primary electricity are 58.67%, 16.97%, 7.98%, and 16.38%, respectively, in 2020, while the same consumption shares are 44.20%, 13.17%, 23.18%, and

19.45% in 2030. Consequently, the proportions of coal and oil in energy consumption constantly decrease, while the proportions of gas and primary electricity constantly increase. These trends are essentially similar to those under S00.

As an emission reduction tool, carbon taxes can reduce fossil energy demand by increasing the cost of fossil fuels. As shown in Fig. 6, under S10, the consumption shares of coal, oil, gas, and primary electricity in 2020 are 54.79%, 17.37%, 7.42%, and 20.42%, respectively, while in 2030, the corresponding shares are 37.11%,

12.65%, 15.07%, and 35.18%. By comparison with S00, introducing carbon taxes considerably reduces the consumption proportion of coal, while the proportions of oil, gas, and primary electricity increase at varying levels – the increase in electricity and gas is especially pronounced. Furthermore, if control of the electricity market is loosened, electricity price increases inhibit electricity consumption. For example, under S11, the consumption shares of coal, oil, gas, and primary electricity in 2020 are 54.82%, 17.69%,

8.04%, and 19.46%, respectively, while in 2030, the corresponding

shares are 36.78%, 14.58%, 21.31%, and 27.33%. Compared to S10, the consumption of primary electricity slightly decreases.

In general, regardless of policy scenario, the proportions of coal and oil in the energy consumption structure of China in the future gradually decrease, while the proportions of gas and primary electricity constantly increase. However, speciﬁc variations are easily inﬂuenced by emission reduction and electricity price policies. Speciﬁcally, marketization of electricity price will reduce the proportion of electricity in primary energy consumption and increase consumption proportion of fossil energies; that said, carbon taxes will make primary electricity more popular. In a word, although energy consumption in China mainly relies on coal in the future, demand and usage of gas and primary electricity will continue to grow at a relatively rapid rate.

5.5. Carbon emission changes

Carbon emissions in China have, naturally, grown as energy consumption in the country has continually increased. China will be faced with severe emission reduction pressure in the future, to this effect. As shown in Fig. 7, variations in carbon emissions in China are closely related to emission reduction and electricity price policies. Speciﬁcally, if emission reduction measures are not considered, under regulated electricity price (S00), carbon emissions increase to 11.436 billion tons in 2020 from 7.710 billion tons in 2010, and at annual growth rate of about 4.02%. Because the extensive economic development mode is not effectively changed, carbon emissions after 2020 continue to rapidly increase, reaching 15.403 billion tons in 2030 – an increase of 34.69% over 2020. If control of the electricity market is loosened, however, the growth rate of carbon emissions will slow down. Under S01, carbon emissions in 2020 and 2030 are 11.202 billion tons and 14.306 billion tons, respectively, decreases of 2.05% and 7.12% compared to emissions under S00. In short, regulated electricity price results in higher carbon emissions.

Carbon taxes, a cost-effective emission reduction tool, would help to mitigate the rapid growth of the Chinese carbon footprint. As shown in Fig. 7, under S10, carbon emissions in 2020 and 2030 are, respectively, 10.024 billion tons and 10.881 billion tons increases of 30.00% and 41.11% over 2010. Compared to S00, carbon emissions in 2020 and 2030 decrease by 12.35% and 29.36%, respectively, suggesting a signiﬁcant effect of carbon tax on emission reduction. Fig. 7 also shows that if the objective of emission reduction is considered while the state loosens its control on the electricity market (S11), carbon emissions in 2020 and 2030 are

10.042 billion tons and 10.784 billion tons, decreases of 10.35% and 24.61%, respectively, compared to S01. Basically, under different electricity price policies, the decreasing amplitudes of carbon emissions for achieving the same carbon intensity goals are differ-

ent; most importantly, the decrease ratio of carbon emissions under regulated electricity price policy is higher.

Fig. 8 illustrates variations in carbon intensity of China under different policy scenarios. Similar to the variations in energy intensity, carbon intensity will constantly decrease in the future as technical level and implementation of energy-saving measures improve, but the decreasing amplitudes differ by scenario. Specifically, if S00 continues, carbon intensities in 2020 and 2030 are

1.99 tons CO2 /ten thousand RMB and 1.64 tons CO2 /ten thousand RMB, decreases of 34.94% and 46.19%, respectively, compared to 2005. If the control to electricity market is loosened and electricity is fully marketized, the decreasing amplitude of carbon intensity will slightly increase; for example, under S01, carbon intensities in 2020 and 2030 are 1.95 tons CO2 /ten thousand RMB and

1.53 tons CO2 /ten thousand RMB, respectively, marking decreases of 36.27% and 50.03% compared to 2005. These ﬁndings suggest that regardless of the electricity price policy adopted, China will not achieve its emission reduction objectives in 2020 or 2030 if the state relies solely on technical improvements without taking additional emission reduction measures. Fig. 8 shows where the variation trends of carbon intensity under S10 and S11 are basically the same – in addition, both scenarios satisfy the common policy objectives, under which carbon intensities in 2020 and 2030 are respectively decreased by 42.5% and 62.5% compared to 2005. Under the same initial points and ﬁnal objectives, the variation processes are fairly similar.

5.6. Electricity price, generation capacity, and subsidies changes

Fig. 9 illustrates the variation conditions of generation capacity under the four scenarios. Under regulated electricity price policy long-term, electricity price remains at a relatively low level and electricity demand stays high, thus the generation capacity is relatively high as driven by demand. Under S00, for example, from 2010 to 2030, China’s generating capacity increases to 1.644 billion tons of standard coal from 0.518 billion tons, at an annual grow rate of about 5.95%. If electricity price is allowed to ﬂuctuate freely, future prices will continually increase – this in turn inhibits the demand for electricity related to social and economic activities, impacting generation capacity of power generation enterprises. Under S01, generation capacity in 2030 is about 1.084 billion tons of standard coal and annual growth rate is 3.76% compared to 2010. As shown in Fig. 8, implementing a carbon tax has negative inﬂuence on generation capacity. Power plants in China produce mainly thermal power, thus the country as of now relies strongly on coal. Carbon taxes will increase production cost for power generation enterprises and further result in decreased generation capacity. Under S11, generation capacity in 2030 is about 0.984 billion tons of standard coal and annual growth rate is about 3.26% compared to 2010, the lowest growth rate of all four scenarios.

China will face continued pressure of electricity price increases in the future, which will be intensiﬁed by the implementation of carbon taxes. In addition, as energy costs rise, the costs of raw material and labor will likewise rise, increasing the overall level of pressure substantially. As shown in Fig. 10, if electricity is marketized by 2016 and allowed to ﬂuctuate freely, the price of electricity will rise continuously. Under S01, the growth rate of electricity price increases to 3.94% in 2030 from 0.90% in 2016. Carbon tax further increases costs for power generation enterprises and intensiﬁes rising electricity prices, especially in the period just following implementation. Under S11, for example, electricity price in 2016 increases by 5.11% compared to previous years and electricity price in 2021 increases by 14.88% over previous years.

To ensure that electricity price stays reasonable, the Chinese government must pay ample yearly subsidies to power generation

enterprises. In this study, we assumed that the government conducts tax returns to power generation enterprises so as to keep the electricity price at a relatively low level. Fig. 10 charts the subsidies required yearly for power generation enterprises under S00 and S10; if emission reduction objectives are not considered, the annual subsidy level increases to 682.937 billion RMB in 2030 from 43.764 billion RMB in 2016 under S00. A quite excessive amount of subsidies, 4393.796 billion RMB in total, would need to be paid in the next ﬁfteen years. If the emission reduction objectives are considered, the annual subsidy level increases to 675.483 billion RMB in 2030 from 43.529 billion RMB in 2016 under S10, and the total amount of subsidies is 4394.662 billion RMB. The introduction of emission reduction policies will not signiﬁcantly change the amount of subsidies required for the electricity industry, though introducing carbon taxes will increase production cost of power generation enterprises and the subsequent decline in generation capacity will inﬂuence subsidy amount (to a fairly negligible degree, however). In short, under gradually increasing pressure of future electricity prices, the economic cost incurred by the Chinese government to control the electricity market also increases.

5.7. Inﬂation changes

Although electricity price marketization reform in China has many advantages, it may also bring about certain disadvantages such as inﬂation. In this study, we adopted the GDP deﬂator (PGDP) to judge variations of price level within society on the whole. The GDP deﬂator, speciﬁcally, represents the ratio between nominal GDP and actual GDP.

Fig. 11 shows the variations of PGDP growth rate under the four scenarios. Compared to regulated electricity price, PGDP growth rate under free electricity price policy will be faster, indicating that electricity price marketization will indeed increase the inﬂation rate. (By comparison, however, the increasing amplitude of inﬂation is not signiﬁcant.) Carbon taxes will also cause commodity prices to rise, also affecting inﬂation. Under S11, the PGDP growth rate is higher than that under S01, mainly because carbon taxes will raise the consumption price of fossil energies and increase the production cost of commodities, increasing the price of said commodities and driving up the inﬂation rate. Fig. 11 shows where carbon tax has a much greater effect, in fact, on inﬂation compared to electricity price policy. These results altogether indicate that future inﬂation pressure in China will be more inﬂuenced by emission reduction policies than other factors.

5.8. Export changes

Export is one of the most important driving forces for economic growth of China. Fig. 12 displays China’s export changes in different scenarios in the future. It can be seen that the electricity price marketization reform in China may have a negative impact on the exports. As electricity is an important input for social and economic activities, the increased electricity prices will also increase

the production costs for numerous enterprises, which will affect their competitive advantages. As we can see, take 2020 as an example, the national export growth rate in S01 is 9.39%, which is lower than 9.47% in S00. Climate policies may also affect China’s export. The introduction of carbon tax in domestic market will reduce the national export signiﬁcantly. As shown, take 2021 as an example, China’s export growth rate in S01 is 7.89%, which is much higher than 5.58% in S11. 6. Conclusion and policy implications

The electricity industry is a fundamental component of any national economy. It is closely related to the daily quality of life of the country’s inhabitants, and serves as a clear indicator of economic development. For a lengthy period of China’s history, its electricity industry was a highly concentrated and vertically integrated government monopoly, thus basic functions of the market on resource allocation were not effectively present. The existing electricity price system was established based on the state ﬁxedprice system under China’s original economic plan, thus it does not meet the requirements of the current market. The price of electricity has deviated from its value for a long time, failing to reﬂect the relationship between electricity supply and demand.

The most urgent problem related to electricity system reform is price reform. Without reasonable electricity prices, the industry will stagnate and any other reform measures will fail. To reduce government intervention in the electricity market and play the most decisive role possible in regard to resource allocation, the state has accelerated the pace of reform in recent years, attempting to set more market-oriented electricity prices that correctly reﬂect supply and demand, scarcity of resources, and the cost of environmental damage (i.e., carbon emissions.) In this study, we constructed the China Dynamic Energy Computable General Equilibrium (CDECGE) model to conduct quantitative evaluation of the economic inﬂuence of Chinese electricity market reform and explore the effects of different electricity price formation mechanisms on future economic growth, energy demand, and carbon emissions. Our most notable conclusions, as-obtained through simulation analysis, can be summarized as follows.

(1) Electricity price marketization reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. Empirical results show that if the carbon intensity reduction objectives of 2020 and 2030 are not considered, the total primary energy consumption of China from 2016 to 2030 is 88.875 billion tons of standard coal under free electricity price policy, and total CO 2 emission is 180.036 billion tons. By comparison with conditions under regulated electricity price, energy consumption decreases

oriented electricity price scenario, future electricity prices will, naturally, rise year-by-year, causing the GDP deﬂator to grow at a higher rate. Compared to that caused by emission reduction policy, however, inﬂation due to electricity price is not signiﬁcant.

Our results altogether show that electricity price marketization reform not only beneﬁts energy-saving initiatives, but also the reduction of carbon emissions. Further, electricity marketization would bolster sustainable growth of the Chinese economy overall. Traditional price control measures have kept electricity price at a relatively low level, but at the cost of invisible subsidies paid to the electricity industry by other industries, causing imbalanced allocation of market resources. To reform electricity price and encourage competition between commodity providers would help provide timely price signals, form true incentives and constraint mechanisms for power generation enterprises, and beneﬁt the long-term development of the industry. At present, China faces multiple challenges including energy shortages and heavy environmental pollution; these issues would be mitigated to some extent by marketization reform of electricity price and heightened focus on sustainable development at the macro-economic level. In short, this paper has revealed several potential advantages inherent to electricity price marketization reform.

5.01% and carbon emission drops 4.70%.

There are also disadvantages to consider, however – most importantly, exacerbated inﬂation. After marketization reform, future electricity prices will rise due to resource scarcity and increased costs of raw materials and labor. Because electricity is in the upstream part of the production chain, increased electricity price directly inﬂuences production costs in many downstream industries, forming cost-propelled inﬂation. The quantitative results of this study also indicate, however, that increased prices caused by marketization are not signiﬁcant compared to those incurred by carbon emission reduction policy. Therefore, decision-makers should pay more attention to the inﬂation while achieving the national carbon intensity reduction targets. In general, electricity marketization is a tortuous and lengthy process. The Chinese government must enhance all available advantages and minimize any inherent disadvantages in implementing electricity market reform while preparing and enacting resolutions informed by thorough, scientiﬁc, and comprehensive data analysis.

(2) Compared to regulated electricity price, market-oriented electricity price better reduces the cost of carbon emissions. Because China’s current emission level is relatively high, to achieve the same carbon intensity reduction objectives, the carbon tax level required by regulated electricity price is higher than that required by free electricity price and thus the negative inﬂuence on the economy is greater. Our simulation showed that if the carbon intensity reduction objectives of 2020 and 2030 are considered, the accumulated GDP of China from 2016 to 2030 is about 1012.80 trillion RMB under free electricity price, representing a 0.25% increase above that under regulated electricity price.

(3) As costs of raw materials and labor increase, the electricity industry will face more and more severe pressure in future years. To keep electricity prices at a relatively low level, the state must pay a large amount of subsidies to power generation enterprises. Under emission reduction mandates, the subsidies issued by the Chinese government to power generation enterprises will increase to 675.483 billion RMB in 2030 from 43.529 billion RMB in 2016, at about 4394.662 billion RMB in total. Ultimately, the cost incurred by the government for intervening in the electricity market is very high.

(4) Electricity market reform may exacerbate inﬂation, but the effects of carbon taxes on inhabitant-level price increases are much greater. We found that under the market-"
16,Economic viability of battery energy storage and grid strategy: A special case of China electricity market,"Battery energy storage (BES) plays an important role in the integration of intermittent renewable power and distributed generation. The price arbitrage is a major source of energy storage income. In China, the electricity price is tightly regulated by the government. It's interesting to find out whether the BES is economic viability in such a special electricity market, and what's the optimal response of the grid (or regulator) when facing the arbitrage activities of BES. This research starts with a price arbitrage model to evaluate the feasibility of energy storage in China's electricity market, which can be used to determine the optimal investment scale and operation mode of energy storage. A quantitative assessment is also implemented to discuss the influence when factors change. Following this, an optimal pricing strategy for grid is established. The results reveal that the storage investment can realize positive profit in some districts where the price gap between peak/off-peak periods is high. Appropriate subsidies can be quantitatively described by sensitivity analysis. In terms of social welfare, the energy storage can be deployed on a large-scale at a low social cost under a suitable price mechanism.","1. Introduction

China is currently in the process of industrialization and urbanization; hence requires large amount of energy [46]. The sustainability of China's economic growth faces a series of environmental and energy problems. Jiang and Lin [21] forecast that China's 2020 primary energy demand may reach 4519 to 5188 Mtce among various scenarios. By 2030, this number may reach 6000 Mtoe (8600 Mtce) according to the estimation of Brockway et al. [7]. It's obvious that the requirement of energy cannot be satisﬁed if it is still supplied by traditional energy in the future. The CO2 emission problem will be more serious. The economic growth in China needs to choose a low-carbon development road [27]. The main solution for these problems is the large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources (RES). However, the fast growing shares of intermittent RES may threaten the reliability of grid and the operation of conventional power systems [47]. The electricity system must be seen afresh as a complex system amenable to analysis using techniques from complexity science [5]. The electrical energy storage (EES) is a key section to deal with these challenges.

The advantages for the adoption of energy storage include [20]: (i) promoting the penetration of renewable energy, and assisting the deployment of distribution generators [30,31,36]; (ii) enhancing the reliability of grid, and making more efﬁcient use of the network [16,34,38]; (iii) using storage to decrease the gap between peak and off-peak periods, which can smooth the generation output [4,41]; (iv) pricing arbitrage and balancing market [6,35].

In general, EES can be categorized into mechanical (pumped hydroelectric storage, compressed air energy storage and ﬂywheels), electrochemical (rechargeable batteries and ﬂow batteries), electrical (super capacitors etc.), thermal energy storage and chemical storage (hydrogen storage) [29]. The most common commercialized storage systems are pumped hydro storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES). They are known as bulk energy storage because of their high technical maturity and large energy capacity.

Although the battery energy storage technologies still have high costs, it's now mature for practical application and close to commercialization stage. The electrical arbitrage, which stores power purchased at low demand periods and sells or uses it on peak, is the major revenue components of BES. Previous studies prove the economic feasibility of electrical storage [24]. Carson and Novan [9] presented a simple two-period model to examine the private and social beneﬁts as well as the potential impact of arbitrage on emissions provided by bulk storage in the Texas electricity market. Bradbury et al. [6] calculated the internal rate of return (IRR) of price arbitrage in the electrical market of United States, and found that in the conventional BES technologies, only ZEBRA can get positive returns in all the markets. Das et al. [12] assessed the beneﬁts and economics of compressed air energy storage (CAES) in the power grid. Kloess and Zach [23] analyzed the economic performance of bulk electricity storage in the German and Austrian electricity market. Zaﬁrakis et al. [44] applied different energy trade strategies to evaluate the value of arbitrage in Europe market, and found the arbitrage value maximizes for the weekly back to back energy trade strategy. Salles et al. [35] discussed the opportunities in energy arbitrage deﬁne the greatest scale for storage applications in the Mid-Atlantic region. Moreover, the arbitrage has the potential to be combined with surplus renewable energy [1]. Anuta et al. [2] reviewed the grid scale electricity storage and ﬁgured out that the cost of ESS is higher than conventional solutions for covering peak electricity demand. However, in some markets with high electricity retail prices, ESS can be proﬁtably operated by integrating with residential photovoltaic systems. Hoppmanna et al. [19] investigated the economic viability of BES integrated with residential photovoltaic in Germany, and concluded that the net present value of battery investment is positive without policy support if the retail electrical price was 0.28 EUR/kWh and discount rate was 4%.

The return of BES is mainly affected by the cost of battery. Nykvist and Nilsson [32] showed that industry-wide cost was estimated to decline by approximately 14% annually between 2007 and 2014. From the cost data collected by Zakeri and Syri [45]; the total capital cost of Li-ion battery was 546V/kWh on average, and 220V/kWh on average for Zn-Br. In April 2015, Tesla launched a commercial lithium battery system Powerwall where the price was only $350/kWh [40]. Similarly, the price of EOS commercial zinc battery was only $160/kWh [15]. Considering the high rate of BES's technology progress, it is necessary to evaluate the economic feasibility by using the latest cost data.

Electricity arbitrage is a market-oriented method to promote the development of energy storage. From the perspective of the grid, the existence of arbitrage enables the grid to shift peaking by adjusting power price. In some regions in China where there are large amount of imported electricity, the peak price is signiﬁcantly higher than off-peak price, which creates space for arbitrage. However, few studies have focused on the economic viability of BES investment in China. Considering the characteristics of China's electricity market, this paper develops an optimization model to calculate the maximum possible revenue the BES could achieve through price arbitrage. The solution of the model provides the optimal size and operating mode under different load conditions.

To account for the uncertainties of input parameters, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the factors which may affect the investment revenue, including lifetime, cost, discount rate, and price in peak/off-peak period. In addition, the mainstream commercial batteries are compared in this model.

The interactions among energy storage investment, grid and emissions are also important issues that need to be considered. Kloess and Zach [23] examined storage revenues by simulating optimal price arbitrage in Austrian and German power market. They found that revenues from load-leveling operation have

decreased considerably, indicating a strong impact of spot market prices on revenues of storage investment. Lamont [25] revealed that storage substantially reduces the peak prices. Zaﬁrakis et al. [44] also demonstrated that as European markets became more efﬁcient, the revenue of energy storage arbitrage was reduced. Liu et al. [28] proposed a new type of energy storage - cloud energy storage - which could provide energy storage services at a substantially lower cost in the level of grid-scale storage service. Hittinger and Azevedo [18] estimated the effect of bulk storage on net emissions and demonstrated that electricity arbitrage will increase the system emissions using current storage technologies (mainly PHS). Oliveira et al. [33] assessed the environmental performance of different electricity storage technologies. Kanakasabapathy [22] considered the consumer and producer surplus of the individual market, and concluded that energy storage would increase the overall social welfare of the market. To evaluate the external inﬂuence of the storage, this paper analyzes the inﬂuence of the power grid when large-scale storages are deployed. The result shows that within the current price mode, the power grid will take a huge cost if large capacity of energy storage is invested. This also shows that China's current electricity pricing mode is not sustainable. Aiming at this problem, this paper further extends the arbitrage model to establish an optimal pricing model for the grid.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the analysis framework of this study, as well as a description of the background and methodology underlying our model. Section 3 presents the results of the economic analysis and the grid pricing strategy, including optimal proﬁtability, external evaluation, sensitivity analysis, comparison of different batteries, and the social costs and beneﬁts under large-scale deployment of energy storage. This is followed by a discussion in Section 4. Conclusions as well as recommendations for future analysis are drawn in Section 5.

This study focuses on BES applied in distributed network. The traditional bulk energy storage technologies, such as PHS and CAES are excluded from this study. Besides, the usage pattern is assumed to be ﬁxed, so the demand side management and smart grid are not considered.

2. Material and methods

This section introduces the background and methodology of our study, including the proﬁle of China's electricity market, the layout of the energy storage system, the latest cost of batteries, the arbitrage model for the private investor and the pricing model for grid.

2.1. Proﬁle of China's electricity market

In 2011, China's total net generating capacity reached 4.47 trillion kilowatt-hour (kWh), surpassing the 4.1 trillion kWh of United States; hence became the largest electricity consumption country in the world. Meanwhile, the distribution of power resources is imbalanced, which means the electricity load center is away from the supply side. In 2014, the annual cross-transmission of electricity in China was 274.1 billion kWh; with Interprovincial transmission amounting to 842 billion kWh, which is 15.3% of the total electricity consumption [10]. To this end, huge resources were invested in transmission lines each year.

The transmission and distribution (T&D) of electricity are deemed as a natural monopoly industry. In China, the T&D network and electricity retail are monopolized by two giant institutions: State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid. Meanwhile, the sale process of electricity is also monopolized by these two giants. The resource endowment, geography, and economic development level among different regions are discrepant. The government regulates the retail price according to the T&D cost and the development level of each district. The regulator implements the identical retail price for the general industrial and commercial department. In some electricity importing districts of China, the peak price is signiﬁcantly higher than off-peak price. Table 1 lists the electricity price in different districts [11,39]. The time is divided into three periods: Peak, Flat and Valley. The huge price difference in these districts create opportunity for the price arbitrage, and the ﬁxed price mode provide stable proﬁt forecasts.

2.2. Layout of energy storage system

The layout of the energy storage system is shown in Fig. 1. It includes battery system, inverter, alternating current (AC) circuit and controller [19]. The input and output of the battery is direct current (DC), so an inverter is use for DC - AC conversion.

2.3. Electricity arbitrage model

Wide spectrums of studies address the economic assessment of energy storage. Lamont [25] develops a theoretical framework to evaluate the marginal values of the components of a storage system. One theoretical approach is applied to an example system to illustrate the changes in marginal values when energy storage penetrates into the system. The model calculates the optimal operating pattern of each hour for a single year. Solving this problem requires 17,520 (i.e., 2*8760) inequality constraints. To simplify the calculations, the large number of inequality constraints was converted to a much smaller set of equivalent equality constraints by decomposing the model into several full charging/discharging cycles. Bradbury et al. [6] used linear optimization to ﬁnd the ESS power and energy capacities that can maximize the internal rate of return (IRR) of price arbitrage in seven real-time markets in the United States for different ESS technologies. In the study by Hoppmann et al. [19]; the NPV was calculated to ﬁnd the optimal storage and photovoltaic system size. It can be simpliﬁed when carrying out the optimization problem in China's electricity market. The main reason is that under the regulation of the government, the pricing mode is repeated every day. That is, the price is identical at the same period of every day. Therefore, in the process of optimization, it is not necessary to carry out the price data for the whole year, but only consider the price of the day. Integrating the existing arbitrage model with the characteristics of China's electricity market, this paper establishes the following model:

2.3.1. Optimization model The model for maximizing the arbitrage revenue is deﬁned by Eq. (1), where NPV is the net present value of storage investment. The NPV which is determined by the earnings before interest depreciation and amortization (EBIDA), the total capital cost (TCC), the residual value (Res) and the discount rate (R), is presented by Eq. (2). Since the residual value is difﬁcult to determine, the residual value is set to be 0 in this paper.

EBIDA is presented by Eq. (4). It equals the annual cost reduction and the storage capacity. The cost reduction per day is equal to the cost variation before and after the application of storage system (Eq. (5)). The original cost and optimal cost are shown in Eqs. (6) and (7), in which the electricity consumption is denoted by ci , the The stored quantity of electricity is given by Eq. (8). It equals the sum of net input into the storage system x i and the initial storage quantity s0 . The sum of net input power in one day is zero (Eq. (9)). The electricity purchased from grid is determined by the consumption and the net input, as presented by Eq. (10). If x i < 0, the system discharges power. If x i ! 0, the system is in charge process. The energy loss in conversion process is reﬂected by the battery's efﬁciency h bat and the inverter's efﬁciency hinv . The input matrix can be deﬁned by Eqs. (11)e(14). The net input in each hour is less than the power limitation (Eq. (15)), and the stored quantity in each hour is greater than 0 and less than the max storage capacity (Eq. (16)). In our case, investor can only purchase electricity from the grid. The power stored in the system can only be used by the investors themselves, and it cannot be sold in the wholesale electricity market, as presented by Eq. (17). The optimization problem is solved by the optimum toolbox of MATLAB. As is shown in Eq. (18), the decision variables include the capacity of storage, initial storage quantity and the net input into the storage system in each hour. The objective function is given by Eq. (19), which is structured by Eqs. (2)e(7). The inequality constraint, Eq. (20), is organized by Eqs. (8), (10), and 15e17. The equality constraint in Eq. (21) is build by Eq. (9). 2.3.2. Speciﬁcation of model parameters The proﬁtability of storage investment might be affected by the load mode. For this reason, 6 scenarios are simulated to compare the optimal storage size and investment revenue. The dynamic load curves are displayed in Fig. 2, with a normalized load data.

The parameter setting of the electricity storage system is given by Table 2. The parameters of battery system are referring to the correlation data of Tesla Powerwall. The degradation of lithium-ion batteries over time is taken into account. The depth of discharge (DOD) of the battery is decrease with the cycles increase [13]. We assume the average DOD of the storage is 80% during the lifetime, so the cost corresponding includes a 20% markup accordingly. In addition, cost and efﬁciency of the inverter are also considered therein. The conversion efﬁciency of inverter is set as 97%. The cost of battery is a main factor affecting the applications of BES. It is generally considered that BES is still subject to higher costs and temporarily unable to carry out large-scale commercial applications. However, many studies of BES were presented few years ago, and the cost estimation from different literature vary widely [14,26,42]. These may make it hard to evaluate the economic feasibility of energy storage technology. In recent years, the cost of battery declined signiﬁcantly. It's necessary to use the latest data when carrying out the economic evaluation of energy storage. Table 3 shows the technical parameters of some commercialized BES products [37]. 2.4. Pricing strategy for the grid

In practice, there has been a controversy about electricity arbitrage based on energy storage for the reason that energy will be lost in the charge/discharge cycle of storage, and power consumption will increased. Carson and Novan [9] examined the social beneﬁts of bulk storage in the Texas electricity market by analyzing the marginal emissions during peak/off-peak periods; they demonstrated that arbitrage will decrease the daily average emissions of NOX and increased daily average emissions of CO2 and SO2. Hittinger and Azevedo [18] modeled the economic and emissions effects of bulk energy storage in American, and got similar conclusions. Though the energy storage may increase the emission, the social welfare will increase due to the marginal utility of electricity is different intertemporal. Kanakasabapathy [22] graphically analyzed the changes in consumer and producer surplus of a market due to pumped storage energy trade, and concluded that energy storage will increase the overall social welfare of the market. As is shown in Table 4, due to the fact that energy storage investors only consider the private cost, the energy storage may result in negative effects such as increase in total electricity consumption, and exacerbation of load ﬂuctuation of the power grid. More importantly, in China, most of the social cost is undertaken by the grid under current price model. The power grid is likely to adjust price to deal with the expansion of the scale of energy storage, which may increase the uncertainty of storage investment. Lamont [25] illustrated the changes in marginal values as storage penetrated the system and indicated that storage substantially reduced the peak prices. So it's important to ﬁgure out whether there exists a way to guide the storage system playing its peaking functions and to reduce the negative impact through pricing optimization as far as possible. To solve this problem, on the basis of the electricity arbitrage model, this section further develops a power grid pricing model. 2.4.1. Two level optimization model The price arbitrage will reduce the revenue of power grid. Obviously, the current pricing mode is not sustainable if the energy storage is developed rapidly. From the point of the power grid, how to optimize pricing is an important issue. Since China's electricity pricing is regulated by the government, any decision to change the pricing mode may be affected by the interests of the stakeholders. In order to reduce the resistance associated with the reform of the pricing mechanism, it has been hypothesized that: from the perspective of the grid, it is hoped that through the development of distributed energy storage, the peak load may decrease, while the grid's revenue remain unchanged. From the user's point of view, they will determine their optimal energy storage investment size and storage model based on the given price. This constitutes a two level optimization problem:

The objective of grid's pricing strategy is to minimize the peak load (Eq. (22)), where the incomes remain unchanged (Eq. (23)). In this equation, Earn ori represents the original revenue, which is the sum of the original electricity price multiplied by the power consumption (Eq. (24)). While Earn opt represents the revenue after deploying energy storage, which is the sum of the optimal electricity price multiplied by optimal purchases (Eq. (25)). The consumer uses the arbitrage model to maximize the private beneﬁts of energy storage investment as shown in Section 2.3. 2.4.2. Simpliﬁed model Since the two-level optimization problem is difﬁcult to solve by the conventional algorithm, the model is simpliﬁed into a singlestage optimization problem. The objective of the model is still to minimize the peak load (Eq. (26)), while the decision variables are composed of the energy storage capacity, initial energy storage volume, net energy input of the system and the electricity price of each hour (Eq. (27)). The grid gets constant returns (Eq. (28)). The NPV of storage investment is set to be larger than the target value (Eq. (29)). 3. Results

As private decision, the goal of energy storage investment based on electricity arbitrage is to maximize the private beneﬁts. However, the externality should not be neglected. Thus, the economic viability of energy storage investment is evaluated, and meanwhile, the yields of energy storage investment and its externality are analyzed. In order to analyze the effect of income level when changing the factors which are related to the investment yields, a sensitivity analysis is conducted in this section. Due to the fact that features of each commercial energy storage battery systems are different, their investment income and external inﬂuences will be different as well. Therefore, different battery systems are compared in this section.

Grid pricing model is aimed at the question that how to adapt the grid to the large-scale development of energy storage system, and what's the corresponding impact on society. This section mainly consider the inﬂuence on social costs and beneﬁts when the energy storage is extensively developed, including the inﬂuence from the increase of power consumption and corresponding costs, the balance of power grid load, etc. 

3.1. Economic evaluation of energy storage investment

3.1.1. Beneﬁts of grid's arbitrage model Fig. 3 shows the net present value per unit investment under different load mode in various districts. As represented by formula(30), the net present value per unit investment (NPV unit ) is equal to the net present value of investment divided by investment spending. The proﬁtability of investment can be directly compared in accordance with NPV unit . As can be seen in the ﬁgure, under the same price mode (same district), the NPV per unit investment is similar for different scenarios.

The result in Fig. 3 conﬁrms other current research. Bakkee et al. [3] calculated the revenues of lithium-ion batteries in the German and UK markets, and found that the NPV could be positive under a interest rate of 4%. The payback period is 6.3 years in UK and 7.6 years in German. Wankmüller et al. [43] presented that the breakeven system cost of BES is 409 $/kWh under 7% interest rate.

Fig. 4 shows the dynamic simulation curve in 24 h, which demonstrates the load of shopping mall in Jiangsu Province. Where “consumption” means the actual amount of consumption for customers, “purchase” means the amount of purchased electricity from grid, “price” means electricity price, “power ﬂow” means the amount of electricity ﬂow out the storage system, and “storage” means the charge capacity of energy storage system. If “power ﬂow” is higher than zero, the system is in the process of discharge, else if the “power ﬂow” is below zero, the system is charging.

3.1.2. Externalities During the operation of the energy storage system, the system charges in low electricity price periods, and discharges in high electricity price periods. The private investment only considers the maximization of private yields, and overlooks the external costs. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the externalities of the energy storage investment. As can be seen from the data in Table 4, in the power of arbitrage, the total electricity consumption increases, which is mainly cause by the power loss in charge/discharge process. In addition, the grid revenue reduces signiﬁcantly. For the most signiﬁcant one, the revenue of grid drop is decreased by 31.1%. Besides, because the private investment only considers proﬁt maximization when making decisions, the energy will be stored when it is in ﬂat period (as can be seen in Fig. 2, 13:00 to 16:00). Some purchasing electricity of peak period will transfer to ﬂat period, causing a new peak which may be higher than the original load.

Fig. 4. Dynamic simulation curves of the energy storage system in 24 h.

3.1.3. Sensitivity analysis The investment income of the energy storage is affected by many factors, including discount rate, life of energy storage system, peak electricity prices, valley electricity prices, and the cost of energy storage system investment. The impact on investment income of those factors is analyzed in this section.

Fig. 5 shows the change of NPV unit under different lifetime. The NPV unit can be used to evaluate the impact on investment beneﬁt when the lifetime of the battery is change with the technology progress. As can be seen in the ﬁgure, under the 10-year warranty period of the Tesla, there are two districts can achieve positive net present value income. And if the15-year useful life of the battery is estimated, there are six districts that can achieve positive net present value income. Furthermore, if the lifetime can be extended to 20 years in the future, all districts can achieve positive net present value income.

Fig. 6 shows the NPV unit under different battery costs. According to the ﬁgure, the changing of investment income can be measured when the battery costs reduction due to the development of technology.

As can be seen in Fig. 7, the changes of discount rate will infuence the income of the energy storage. Table 5 presents the average interest rate in China from 2005 to 2014 (calculated by the statistical data published by the World Bank). For commercial users, one third of the districts can achieve positive yields if the investment yields are calculated by the loan interest rate. For household users, more than half of the districts can achieve positive yields if the investment yields are calculated by deposit rate. If the electricity price in future is adjusted with the inﬂation, a positive yields can be achieved in most districts calculated by real interest rate.

The investment income of the energy storage will be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the peak-valley price. Fig. 8 show the impact on the energy storage investment income of the peak price in different change range.

3.1.4. Comparison of various batteries As shown in Table 3, the technical characteristics of current commercial batteries have signiﬁcant difference. To make a comparison between different types of batteries, this paper inputs the relevant parameters into the model. The results are displayed in Figs. 9 and 10. From the net present value of unit investment for different types of batteries which is given by Fig. 9, the investment income of lithium-ion battery is not remarkable compared with Eos Aurora and Imergy whose NPV is higher. This is mainly due to the fact that Eos Aurora has lower unit cost, and reaches a lifetime of 15 years; Imergy has a lifetime up to 30 years, leading to a higher ﬁnal return on investment.

But it's important to note that the charge and discharge efﬁciency of lithium-ion battery is higher; the power loss during the storage process is smaller than the other ones correspondingly. As is shown in Fig. 10, the incremental electricity consumption of lithium-ion battery is much lower than other brands of batteries, and the external cost is lower correspondingly.

3.2. The steady state under optimal pricing strategy

Since it's difﬁcult to ﬁnd the load characteristics in the open data, in our calculation, the data of a wider area are used to represent the load characteristics of each district. For instance, the load curves of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei are uniform. Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu use the load data of eastern China power grid [17]. The load curves of Guangzhou and Shenzhen quote the load characteristic data of Guangdong power grid [8]. It is notable that this analytical method is also applicable to evaluate the single user.

The comprehensive inﬂuences are considered from the following dimensions:

No matter how the price is setting, the cost of energy storage will ﬁnally be reﬂect in the electricity price and paid by the customer. The “Expense Increment (EI)” represents the increase of total social electricity expenditures caused by using energy storage systems, which can be calculated by Eq. (31). The annual cost of energy storage investment C a is represented by Eq. (33), which is deduced from Eq. (32). It should be noted that the application of energy storage may bring some positive externalities such as a lower grid investment and higher power plant efﬁciency. So the actual social cost may lower than the EI when allocating energy storage.

Due to there exist energy loss in the charge/discharge process, the ﬁnal power consumption will increase. The rate of “Power consumption increment (PI)” can be calculated by Eq. (34).

The load of grid may be more smoothly by the use of energy storage. We can compare the relative standard deviation (RSD) of load characteristic before and after applying the energy storage.

“Storage vol. vs. Day Consumption (SC) ” is the ratio between the volume of storage and daily consumption, which can be used for measuring the relative scale of energy storage. The value can be calculated by Eq. (35).

Fig. 11. The comparison before and after using optimal strategy.

The ﬁnal state is deﬁned as “steady state”. In the steady state, the max load can be minimized under the constraints. Table 6 presents the variation of each valuable under the steady state, and Fig. 11 provides an intuitive example which demonstrates the simulated result of shopping mall in Jiangsu province. The load ﬂuctuation of the grid is decrease under the more ﬂexible price strategy.

4. Discussion

The previous section shows the economic evaluation results of private energy storage investment and the equilibrium under optimal grid pricing strategy. These results will be discussed in this section.

4.1. Discussion of energy storage investment

According to the cost analysis, the energy storage investment is able to achieve positive returns in some districts. The comparison results in different districts demonstrate that, the higher the price difference between peak and off-peak period is, the better the returns from energy storage system will be. Under the existing peak-valley price, some districts, especially those who have high

Table 6 The variation under optimal pricing mode.

price variance, such as Beijing and Jiangsu, can be attracted by the energy storage returns. But a stable expectation should be given to investors. A contract with a stable long-term peak-valley price deviation may be effective. In other districts like Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhejiang, Hebei, etc., the development of energy storage relies on some appropriate incentives, such as direct subsidies for equipment investment, preferential loan rates, higher peak-valley price variance, etc.

The peak-valley price variance of Shenzhen is higher than Zhejiang, but Zhejiang has a higher NPV. This can be attributed to availability of a better system brought by three peak period in Zhejiang. So it can improve the economic feasibility by using more complex peak-valley division way, and optimizing the setting of peak and valley period.

Under the same pricing policy, the net incomes of different types of load patterns have little difference. The main reason is that the energy storage system supplies power outside in peak period and stores power in valley period. So the income is mainly affected by the peak-valley price variance, and the division way of peakvalley period. The peak-valley price variance affects energy storage income per cycle, and the division way of peak-valley period determines the efﬁciency of the energy storage system.

According to the externality analysis, the power consumption will increase due to the energy loss in the charging/discharging process. The increment ratio falls within the range of 2.9%e6.7% in different districts. Overall, the growth of power consumption is not obvious. Due to the arbitrage proﬁt and cost come from the power grid; the income of grid may decline signiﬁcantly (13.2%e31.1%). Furthermore, the operation of energy storage is mainly related to price variance and time period; this may leads to a higher peak load (an increase of 54.7%e127.7%). Therefore, in accordance with the current pricing mode, the grid will undertake huge cost. With regards to this consideration, the current pricing mechanism of the grid is not sustainable and must be adapted to the development of the energy storage.

The sensitivity analysis shows how the income level will change with the inﬂuence factors. The extension of the service life can improve the income level of the storage investment. In accordance with the expected lifetime of 15 years, the energy storage investment can achieve positive returns in most districts. In addition, reducing investment costs can also signiﬁcantly improve the income level. Under the estimated commercialized cost of $250/kWh, most districts can obtain positive returns. Besides, the discount rate and peak-valley price variance have a certain impact on returns. Analysis in this section can provide valuable information for making subsidy policies. The analysis can quantitatively calculate the impact on returns by using direct investment subsidies, prime rate, adjustment of peak-valley price, etc.

Comparing the NPV and externality of different batteries, it can be found that although the investment return of Tesla's lithium battery is not the highest, the increment of the power consumption during charge/discharge process is minimal, and the corresponding external costs are relatively low owing to its high charge and discharge efﬁciency.

4.2. Discussion on the optimal pricing strategy of grid

The peak load can be effectively reduced by applied the pricing strategy of grid. As can be seen from Table 6, in the ﬁnal steady state, the maximum load of the grid is declined signiﬁcantly in various districts. At the same time, the relative standard deviation of the load greatly reduced under the optimization state. This is very meaningful in practice. On the one hand, the maximum load of the grid needs to adapt the peak load, so the more balanced the load is, the less the investment of grid is needed. On the other hand, a more balanced load can improve the operating efﬁciency and stability, which will reduce the cost of power plant.

After optimization, the increment of power consumption led by the energy storage only account for a small proportion in total power consumption. As can be seen from Table 6, the increment rate ranges from 0.7% to 1.1%.Some researches ﬁgured out that the current energy storage technologies may increase the electricity consumption due to the energy loss in the charge/discharge process. But if the energy storage system can be applied in a reasonable way, the power plant will be maintained at the optimum operating conditions. These may reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, the carbon emissions caused by energy storage should be evaluated by further research.

With reference to the cost of electricity, the whole society's expenditure increases, ranging from 6.1% to 11.2%. It should be noted that, in the setting of the model, the income of the grid is assume to remain unchanged in the hypothesis of the model, the cost of this increased expenditure is burdened by the consumer. But in actual operation, cost of the increased part can be transferred to the grid or supplied by government subsidies.

Under the steady state, the amount of electricity consumption per day is among the proportion of 4.6%e7.4%. This date demonstrates that the growth space of the energy storage investment is huge in the future. In Jiangsu province, for example, the total power consumption is 495.66 billion kWh in 2013. If energy storage capacity reached 50% level of the steady state, the requirement (of energy storage) will be 37.344 million kWh.

5. Conclusions and policy implications

Energy storage technologies might be one of the most crucial parts of energy system in the future. Whether the energy storage system can be economically feasible is an important question for policy makers and investors. In this paper, one optimal arbitrage model is established to analyze the beneﬁt from the price arbitrage based on the peak and off-peak power price gap in China. Through the evaluation of economic feasibility, it can be found that the investment of energy storage can achieve positive returns in some districts. This result reveals an inspiring fact that the energy storage investment is already proﬁtable without subsidies under some districts, and the development of energy storage can be promoted by the power of the market even without subsidies.

Moreover, this paper evaluates the quantitative relationship between investment revenue and impact factors such as the lifetime, cost per unit capacity, discount rate and peak-valley price. The results reveal that the storage investment can get a positive NPV in most districts if the lifetime of battery can be increased to 15 years or the cost can be reduced to $250/kWh (which is expected as the cost of Tesla energy for utilities). A higher peak/valley price variation and a lower discount interest rate also have signiﬁcant positive inﬂuence for the NPV. Besides, the investment revenue may be affected by the division method of peak-valley periods. These ﬁndings will help predict the inﬂuence of the large-scale energy storage system deployment, as well as provide useful information for the policy formulation. Furthermore, external inﬂuence of energy storage is analyzed. The application of energy storage technology will increase electricity consumption, and make a larger cost for grid. Hence, the current pricing method is not sustainable. Finally, by comparing the mainstream commercial batteries, it can be concluded that though the NPV of lithium battery is relatively low due to the high device cost, the social cost of the lithium battery is smaller than other rivals if consider the externalities. This result provides a reference for the BES's technology selection at grid level that the policy should focus on the lithium battery.

With the development of BES, the revenue of the power grid will reduce under current price mechanism. As an extension of the arbitrage model, this paper establishes an optimal pricing model from the point of view of the grid. The simulate results indicate that the grid could relieve the shock of energy storage by formulate a more elastic price model. Under the optimal price mechanism, the load of the grid will be more balanced, and the power plant will be able to run more stably and efﬁciently. The optimal investment scale under steady state is also estimated. The result reveals that there exists huge space for the deployment of BES.

The conclusions of this study have proposed a series of useful information for policy makers and stakeholders. The crucial points are as follows:

C According to the result of economic viability analysis, the cost of energy storage has already declined to the level of practical application under some certain conditions. With the sustained decline in cost, the BES may possess the potential to be large-scale deployed in the near future. The stakeholders such as power grid, power plant, distributed generators, consumer and market regulator, should change their strategy and behavior to adapt this new transformation. C The BES owns externalities. On the one hand, energy storage may enhance social welfare. On the other hand, the ﬁnal electricity consumption may increase due to the energy loss. These inﬂuences should be systematically considered when making the support policy. C The grid enterprise may suffer shocks from energy storage; the current pricing mode is not sustainable. This implies that the current price mechanism of China's electricity market needs a further reform. This research proposes a pricing strategy for the grid, which can prompt the BES running at an effective way.

With the development of energy storage technology, signiﬁcant changes may happen in the world's energy market. The power grid and power plant may operate more efﬁciently, and the ability to absorb the renewable energy may be enhanced. It can be expected that in the near future, these changes may profoundly impact the energy structure of the world, and even the way of human's live."
17,Electricity and Telecom Regulation: China in Context,"This study analyzes China’s telecommunications and electricity sector from three perspectives – market reforms, regulatory reforms, and their intersection with major challenges – and places each in a global context.  Market reforms include changes in market structure, both globally and in China.  Regulatory reforms include changes in governance structure, both globally and in China, along with price reform.  For telecom, the intersection is with Internet and media; for electricity, with the environment. China has implemented reforms in both sectors with significant success in terms of massive investment and increased subscribership.  However, in both sectors there are longstanding problems that if unresolved will have significant opportunity costs in terms of growth and innovation.","Introduction Electricity and communications services are both highly regulated infrastructure industries in most countries. While usually there is a historically state-owned monopoly, many countries have started to promote competition where possible. Around the world, however, telecom reforms are largely successful, while results of electricity reforms are mixed. China has implemented reforms in both sectors with significant success in terms of massive investment and increased subscribership. However, in both sectors there are longstanding problems that if unresolved will have significant opportunity costs in terms of growth and innovation.

In general, electricity and telecommunications markets differ in two respects. First, in telecom, wireline phone service now competes directly with mobile phone service. Furthermore, it costs less to build a mobile phone infrastructure than a wireline one. For electricity there is no direct competitors to the monopolist’s transmission and distribution system. (Zhang et al 2008). The exception might be a distributed generation system, which are still in early phases even in developed markets. (Kessides 2012). Instead, much of the technical innovation in electricity has been in power generation, for example in renewable energy and electricity conservation. In contrast with mobile phone infrastructure, however, renewable energy investments may cost more for resources like coal. Furthermore, the intermittent nature of electricity from sources like wind and solar generate further costs to the transmission grid, which is optimally designed for a steady generation electricity, not ebbs and flows according to daylight or wind conditions.

Second, communications can easily be stored and conveyed later, electricity cannot. The Internet can store and convey messages, which uses the network more efficiently service than traditional telecom. In contrast, electricity is not easily stored; there are limits to the capacity of batteries. When electricity is in demand is when electricity has to be generated. Therefore, while managing congestion on a communications network affects service quality, managing congestion on an electricity network is the difference between success and failure. Consequently, while interconnection price, terms, and conditions that govern interconnection among operators is important for both sectors, it is especially important in electricity. In communications, there is often more than one infrastructure over which a message can be sent, and a message sent now can be delivered later, reducing the relative importance of any single type of interconnection rules. In contrast, in electricity, when there is only one nationwide transmission grid, with no alternative infrastructures to scale, and little ability to store electricity shift on the network, then the properly functioning rules for transmission prices, terms, and conditions, are the difference between a working market and a blackout.

This study analyzes both the telecommunications and electricity sector from three perspectives – market reforms, regulatory reforms, and their intersection with major challenges. Market reforms discusses the changes in market structure, both globally and in China. Regulatory reforms discusses changes in governance structure, both globally and in China, along with price reform. For telecom, the intersection is with Internet and media; for electricity, with the environment.

Market reforms. In telecom, the literature demonstrate that market competition is the most important factor that improves price, quality, investments, access, and innovation. The next most important is an independent regulator, and the third is privatization of the monopoly. In electricity, the consensus is that most countries benefit from competition in generation, particularly allowing private investment. For this competition to succeed, there should be vertical separation of the state-owned monopoly’s power generation function and transmission and distribution function. Whether retail competition and privatization of the monopoly always brings gains is less clear.

Market reforms in China. In telecom, facilities are all owned by the three large state-owned operators – China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom. Private, non-state-owned companies are allowed in some segments such as Internet service providers, mobile virtual network operators, and Internet applications. There is nationwide, universal access to telecom services. In electricity, also, all the main players are state-owned companies. There is nationwide universal access to electricity. Some private investment has been allowed in power generation. There is some competition in generation, otherwise in all other segments there is not.

Regulatory reforms. In telecom, there is consensus that an independent regulator is in a best position to resolve key conflicts, such as over interconnection between networks. While retail pricing should be determined by the market, interconnection rates continue to be regulated. In many countries, the regulator covers both telecom and media, a reflection of the convergence of these technologies. In electricity, there is consensus that there should be separate regulator. Electricity reform’s success is sensitive to the performance of broader economic reforms, such as financial reform. Most countries with effective regulatory regimes have a planning process that involves consultation with local authorities and companies that forecasts supply and demand, and sets relevant tariffs.

Regulatory reforms in China. In telecom, while the regulator is separate, it is not perceived as independent. Different authorities are responsible for telecom and media, requiring the State Council to coordinate. While retail prices are market determined, there is frequent conflict over interconnection. In electricity, the regulator is separate, but not independent. Regulation of transmission and distribution is simple, not yet adapting planning and regulatory techniques common in other countries. Recently, some planning authority has devolved to local authorities, who know market needs best. Pricing of resources, network services, and retail services remains highly complex, and reflects historic priorities such as stability, over innovation.

Intersections. In telecommunications, one of the major challenges is the convergence of telecom and media. China’s regulatory regime is designed to promote growth in telecommunications, to regulate media for ideological goals, as well as economic ones. In electricity, one of the major challenges is to mitigate the impact of service on the environment. China’s regulatory regime is designed to promote economic growth and moderate inflation, instead of energy efficiency.

Telecom – market reforms

In telecom, the two big market reforms are de-monopolization and privatization. Most countries began telephone service with a government monopoly. Early pioneers like Sweden started with a collection of private and cooperatively owned telephone exchanges that were eventually consolidated into a national state-owned monopoly (Wallsten 2005). The U.S. was an exception; while AT&T consolidated numerous small phone companies nationwide, it was never governmentowned (Brock 2002).

Privatization is selling the state-owned enterprise to private investors, either a few large ones, or listing the company on the stock exchange. One of the goals of privatization is to separate the role of the regulator from the role of the service provider. When the government plays both roles there can be internal conflicts of interest between the goals of regulation, which are the interests of the broader public, and the for-profit goals of maximizing revenue for the government treasury. Privatizing a telecom monopoly usually affects the broader economy. When Australia sold Telstra shares in 1997 it became the most widely held stock in the country (Harris and Lye 2010). A related issue is the sequence of reforms, whether privatization or demonopolization should take place first. Governments sometimes privatize first because the sale of a monopoly may generate more return than the sale of a company that has competitors. However, Wallsten’s World Bank study of 200 countries from 1987-1999 shows that establishing a regulatory authority before privatization increased telecom investment, fixed phone development and mobile phone development. Further, he found investors were willing to pay more to invest in telecom firms in markets with a regulatory authority; they required a risk premium to invest in countries without one (Wallsten 2002).

Mexico and Brazil also illustrate the effect of sequencing reforms. In Mexico, privatization happened first. Telmex was sold to a private investor; Telmex then used every possible lever to delay de-monopolization. Brazil liberalized first, introducing competition in most segments of the market. In Brazil there was more telecom investment and lower prices for consumers than in Mexico. However, Telmex has been a successful national champion and invested heavily outside Mexico, not true of Brazil’s telecom companies (Mariscal and Rivera 2005).

De-monopolization means breaking the telecom company’s monopoly. The monopoly can be divided into several parts that compete with each other, new companies can be allowed into the market, or former monopoly’s can be restricted from expanding into new markets, or any combination of the above. The US divided AT&T into a long distance company and a collection of local companies. New entrants were allowed in every market. Japan structurally separated long distance from local, and local was separated into two regional companies. Meanwhile, the government retained control of the company. New entrants went into mobile phone and Internet markets (Anchordoguy 2001).

Mobile phone market and competition. In a study of over 100 countries from 20082014, the ITU reports that competition is the most important factor that drives down price for mobile phone service. Regulatory environments have a significant, but less important effect (ITU 2014). Countries like France and Great Britain opened mobile telecom service to new entry while regulating the former monopolist more heavily. The 1990’s, when international consensus was forming that competition in telecom was beneficial, was also when mobile phone technology began to take hold in the market. When governments opened mobile to competition, rarely could the incumbent phone company dominate. In many developing countries, opening the mobile market led quickly to mobile networks larger than the wireline. Beginning in 2002, there were more mobile phones in the world than fixed phones (World Bank).

Telecom – market reform in China No privatization. In China, all facilities based telecom operators are state-owned enterprises. While China’s multi-pronged approach to introducing competition is not an unusual approach to telecom market reform, retaining state-ownership of all major service providers is unique.

New entry and separate regulator. The separation of the Ministry from China Telecom occurred in 1997, partly to solve interconnection problems between China Telecom and the second operator China Unicom. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications became the Ministry of Information and Industry and is now the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; in each iteration its portfolio broadened.

Vertical and horizontal separation. China Telecom’s mobile operations were spun off to become China Mobile in 1999 to even the playing field for competition by Unicom. China Telecom remained the incumbent de facto monopoly in wireline telecom service. In 2002 the government split China Telecom north; the northern company became China Netcom, later merged with Unicom. (Wu 2009). Now, each of the two regions has one wireline company – Unicom in the north and Telecom in the south.

Leveling the playing field by market share -3G. In 2003, the number of mobile phone subscribers exceeded fixed phones for the first time in China (World Bank). Market reforms now focus on advancing the mobile phone market. In 2009, the MIIT issued three 3G license, each in a different standard, to the country’s three mobile operators. The strongest operator received the standard with weakest commercial potential, TD-SCMA; the weakest operator received the standard with the rosiest commercial potential. China Mobile received the least commercially favorable standard (Qin 2011).

Re-leveling the playing field - 4G. 4G mobile service’s major distinction from 3G services is that it allows faster Internet service. In December 2013, MIIT issued 4G licenses for TD-SCMA, one each to China Mobile, China Telecom, and Unicom; although only China Mobile was expected to deploy. China Mobile, which had received the least commercially viable 3G license, was the first to build out its 4G service, using the TD-LTE platform (Telegeography 6/26/2014). The 4G TD-LTE has already had successful commercial deployment in several markets around the world. (Wikipedia) By the end of 2014, China Mobile’s already had 90 million 4G subscribers. Unicom and Telecom’s 3G FD-TDMA licenses were issued in March 2015 (Telegeography 3/2/2014).

China Mobile was eager to move to 4G because its 3G standard was not as popular with subscribers as Unicom and Telecom’s. In contrast, Telecom and Unicom are still trying to recoup investment from their 3G networks (Tan). As of 2015, Unicom and China Telecom have plenty of capacity on their recently built 3G networks. Nevertheless, since they have been issued 4G licenses, they are expected to press ahead. .

New entry- Mobile Virtual Network Operators. In 2014, the government allowed private companies to provide mobile service to customers by becoming a MobileVirtual Network Operators (MVNO). These companies may lease services from the big three network operators, but are not allowed to own their own facilities. The challenge is for MVNO’s to attract customers away from their current provider with some value-added service. The first MVNO’s went live in May 2014 (Telegeography 5/6/14). Reports in 2015 suggest that MVNO’s are having difficulty getting good interconnection terms with from the large operators and, therefore, are finding it hard to offer a competitive retail prices.

Broadband Internet over telecom infrastructure. There are three large commercial Internet backbones in China, each of the three telecom operators – China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. Also, there are several educational and research backbone providers run by government ministries. At the retail level, there are numerous Internet service providers, mostly private, not state-owned. The retail Internet service providers must rely on the backbone providers for connectivity to the Internet (Hu 2011).

Broadband Internet over cable television infrastructure. For cable television operators to offer broadband Internet service, they must have a digital network. In China, the central government first pursued a market-led strategy for the digitalization of cable (Zhou 2010). However, households were reluctant to purchase set top boxes and the government missed its original 2005 target. The government launched subsidy program to cable operators to purchase set-top boxes and give them free to households. Cable companies were pushed to invest in digitalizing the network with the threat they might otherwise lose their monopolies (Starks 2010). Since this program launched, more than 200 cities are taking advantage of this program, 100 have finished their digital transition (Zhou 2010). The current goal is complete digitalization of the cable network by 2015 (Starks 2010).

Internet applications. In the Internet market, applications and services are dominated by private, commercial companies, not state-owned enterprises. One example is WeChat, mobile app that allows subscribers to leave audio voicechat messages. WeChat’s success shrank the telecom companies’ texting revenue. Initially, the telecom companies demanded payment, but the government refused to take what would have been an unpopular action. Similar scenarios have occurred with VoiceOver-Internet Protocol in the past (Wu 2009) and are likely to continue in the future.

Telecom – regulatory reform

The telecom reforms that began in the United States in the 1980’s, followed by Japan, Great Britain and other European countries quickly demonstrated benefits in terms of lower prices for consumers and greater technological innovation. Independent regulatory agencies in these countries made implementing these reforms easier. Separating regulation from operations. For governments that ran the telecom network, the first step was to separate the organization that operated the network from the organization that regulated the network. The regulator worked in the public interest; the operator in the interest of shareholders. Privatizing the telecom operator pushed the organization to behave more like ordinary company and less like a public utility. In the telecom sector, the number of independent regulatory agencies skyrocketed from 14 to 148 from 1990 to 2007 (Jordana and Levi-Faur 2006, Majone 1996).

Bolstering the regulator’s independence. Many countries implemented reforms that to increase the regulator’s independence from industry and from political interference. Much like the ideal central bank that sets interest rates with long term economic growth in mind, not the political vagaries of annual fiscal budget, an independent telecom regulator can set rules for entry, exit, and cooperation with the long term game in mind, without daily pressures from politicians to give out more and cheaper services to friends and constituents. Things that bolster a regulator’s independence include reliable budget resources, clear decision-making authority, transparent procedures, and personnel and ethics rules that enhance staff integrity. For example, Hong Kong’s regulator OFCA derives its entire budget from fees collected from licensees, not from the rest of government. In the U.S., administrative procedures during rulemakings require that all comments, whether from industry, consumers, or other parts of the US government, are made public. In Japan, government officials commit to public service and not until retirement are they likely to enter the private sector. This dampens the effect of the lobbyist “revolving door” which can give some officials an incentive to put rules in place that would advantageous to future employers. Many countries have some combination of safeguards to preserve the regulator’s freedom to act judiciously (Wu 2008).

A World Bank study of 200 countries from 1985-1999 shows that two functions were important to increasing telecom investment and boosting fixed and mobile subscriptions; a separate regulatory authority and privatization. Of the two, establishing a separate regulatory was more significant than privatization, especially if the regulator was created first (Wallsten 2002). Edwards and Waverman’s study of 15 European regulators from 1997-2003 showed that markets with an independent regulator and a privatized telecom operator had the lowest interconnection rates – the price that telecom networks pay each other to complete their calls. Next best interconnection rates were those markets with independent regulators with state-owned incumbents. The highest interconnection rates were in markets without a separate regulator and with state-owned incumbents (Edwards and Waverman 2006).

Interconnection. Making interconnection work among operators is key to the modern competitive telecom market. Consumers expect to be able to call from one telephone anyone else who has a telephone, even if the party they are calling is on a different operator’s network. This is possible only because operators, even those that compete with one another, interconnect their networks. In a monopoly environment, no interconnection regime is required. However, in a multi-operator environment, interconnection is important, and because an incumbent operator is unlikely to interconnect voluntarily, explicit rules that govern interconnection are necessary.

Interconnection rules typically detail several major categories of conditions. For example, there is often a set of legal obligations that identify what kind of operator is required to provide interconnection, the procedures an operator must follow to request interconnection, and a dispute resolution mechanism to manage conflicts among operators. Also, there are often technical rules that identify the minimum points in the network where interconnection should take place; furthermore, operators with market power are often obligated to lease additional essential elements of their network to other operators, and time frames are often indicated for delivering these technical services. Finally, there are usually rules that establish a standard for setting prices for interconnection. These can be specific prices, price ceilings, or prices based on economic cost models (Wu 2002).

Telecom- regulatory reform in China Separating regulator from operator. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications was separated from China Telecom in 1997. At the same time MPT was combined with the Ministry of Electronics Industry and renamed the Ministry of Information Industry (MII). The Ministry of Electronics Industry owned Unicom, the single competitor to China Telecom. The creation of MII by combining the two ministries that owned telecom operators was designed to make regulation more even handed. Previously, it was perceived to be tilted in China Telecom’s favor. In 2008, MII was combined and reorganized to become part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). In addition to the scope of MII, industry management formerly under the NDRC, the Commission for Science, Technology, the Industry for National Defense, and the State Council Informatization Office. MIIT has 10 general departments and 8 ICT departments.

Media regulator - SARFT. SARFT (State Administration for Radio, Film, and Television) is responsible for radio and television programming, particularly foreign content, and controls access to satellite and cable channels. Its Beijing headquarters are closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party propaganda offices, and similar links are replicated at the provincial and local levels of government. It is primarily the local offices that undertake the practical operation of the hundreds of cable television networks, which SARFT is consolidating. Now that it is possible to watch television over the Internet, SARFT and MIIT can be at odds. SARFT has succeeded in requiring telephone companies to work with commercial broadcasters if they want to offer IPTV services, but gray areas still exist (Wu and Leung 2012, Liu and Jayakar 2012). State Council. The series of market reforms through the 1990’s and 2000’s were all implemented at the State Council level, many times at the reported resistance of the telecom ministry. From one perspective, managing market reforms at the State Council makes sense. Since all telecom operators in China are state-owned enterprises backed by various government agencies, a single ministry like MIIT may not have the stature to undertake such reforms. From another perspective, the fact that major market reforms in telecom are not the responsibility of the regulator suggests the regulator is weak.

State Council Leading Groups are one instrument for the State Council to exercise leadership. The status of leading groups in the State Council is somewhat obscure, however, the existence of such groups usually somewhat lessens the importance of those ministries who must be guided by them. For example, in the mid-1990's the State Council Informatization Leading Group Office, played a role in the abolition of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the creation of the Ministry of Information Industry in 1998. It was abolished after MII was created, affirming MII's pre-eminence in the field. Soon after, however, in 1999, the State Council reestablished a “leading group for national information work.” Chaired by then Premier Zhu Rongji, this leading group had authority over information issues, including the Internet. This group played a key advisory role to the State Council leadership in the 2002 decision to split China Telecom into northern and southern companies (Wu 2009).

In early 2014, the government announced President Xi Jingping would lead a new State Council central Internet Security and Informatization Leading Group. The group’s goal is to lead and coordinate Internet security and informatization policy, especially to balance the priorities of expanding Internet use in China and “maintaining proper guidance of online opinions in terms of timing, intensity and impact.” (Xinhua 2/27/14) One observer Willy Wop-Lam interpreted the creation of this leading group as a sign of further crackdowns to come on Internet content (Lam). Another observer Terry Graham of Hong Kong University said the creation of the leading group could be seen as an acknowledgement that the growth of the Internet cannot be left in the hands of the propaganda system, but did have to be balanced against the need for growth and development (Graham 2015).

Interconnection. The story of interconnection in China is a string of disputes and their resolutions, an ever evolving series of government-issued rules and procedures, and a mix of government institutions with varying capacity to handle the disputes in line with the rules that have been issued. The state has not yet succeeded in establishing a regulatory framework for interconnection that operators are willing to use, which creates market uncertainty that favors the most powerful operators. MIIT lacks the cost data from the firms to make good interconnection pricing decisions. It may further lack the technical skill to process the data in order to strengthen the interconnection regime. In short, the interconnection regime in China is weak, and that vacuum is filled by the most powerful operators moderated only by occasional State Council fiats (Wu 2009).

In 1995, MPT issued some initial technical specifications for interconnection. In 1999, MII issued provisional interconnection rules, which are still in effect today. The Telecommunications Decree of 2000 contains some language on interconnection, largely focusing on dispute resolution procedures. In the meantime, the government’s successive decisions to divide China Telecom, once in 1999 and a second time in 2002, can be interpreted as the use of structural separation as a tool to prevent anticompetitive conduct in recognition of the failure of the rules-based interconnection regime (Wu 2009).

The most recent kerfuffle was in 2011. Broadband Internet development is now a priority. In 2010, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences released a report noting that while limiting international Internet connections to China Telecom and Unicom was necessary to maintain an effective Chinese firewall, it means these two companies were providing poor service at high prices (Cao 2011). In early 2011, CNNIC released its first study of broadband speed, conducted by testing 20 major websites in 31 provinces and municipalities, once an hour for 24 hours. Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing were congested, so the top provinces turned out to be Henan, Hunan, and Hebei (CNNIC 2011).

Amid a general sense that broadband development in China had stalled, the NDRC announced an anti-monopoly investigation against China Unicom and China Telecom for abusing market power in the Internet market (Cao 2011). Caixin reported that the NDRC action was backed by other government entities such as SARFT, with an interest in making it easier for broadcasters and cable television companies to enter the Internet market. Not only were broadband speeds slow, but broadband prices in China were three times higher than in Vietnam, four times higher than the US, and 29 times higher than South Korea (Caixin 12/26/2011). In December 2011, China Telecom and China Unicom submitted new price schedules to NDRC that were to lower consumer Internet access prices by 35% within five years (Caixin 12/5/2011).

Telecom pricing In May 2014, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information stopped regulating retail tariffs for telecom service (Telegeography, May 12, 2014). For years, prices were held high by government-set tariffs; period price wars would break out among operators in contravention of regulations (Wu 2009).

Prior to 2014, the government organizations involved in tariff setting were the MII and State Planning and Development Commission (SPDC) Major tariff changes are submitted by the MII to the SPDC for approval. Other government players include the local telecommunications authorities who have a key role in setting some retail rates. By the 2000s the government tariff was often higher than the prices consumers found in the market. As various new technologies emerged like personal handyphone service and Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP), operators flouted the tariffs, apparently chasing new subscribers instead of higher profits. (Wu 2009).

The story of tariff reform in China’s telecom market illustrates the futility of the government’s effort to contain the market under state control. In those areas of telecom policy where actors are few—such as in decisions on how many operators should be licensed in the market or interconnection, where the only actors are the limited number of operators—the government has more tools available to it to guide the market. In the area of tariffs, where dozens of local branch operators can surreptitiously offer many varieties of service packages to millions of consumers, the state is helpless to guide the market. Consumers and producers of telecom services were forcing on the government an ideological shift from command economy pricing to market pricing. The abolition of retail telecom tariffs in 2014 is the culmination of this trend.

Relationship between retail and wholesale prices. In a competitive telecom market, while free market pricing is expected in retail, regulated pricing is expected for interconnection rates. Despite the government’s investigation into anti-competitive conduct in 2011, interconnection problems remain. For example, on May 15, 2015, Premier Li Keqiang complained that broadband prices in China were too high; this was followed by immediate announcements by carriers that prices would be reduced. One reasons retail rates for Internet remain high is that the interconnection rates faced by Internet Service providers are high due to lack of competition. Both for basic interconnection of networks and for access to international gateways, Internet traffic in China all must traverse a limited number of points controlled by the state-owned telecom operators. Traffic patterns are controlled in order to comply with policies for Internet content filtering. Because these points are bottlenecks, these facility owners can charge a monopoly rate for the service. As long as these conditions remain, the telecom companies profit more by charging a monopoly price. They will not generate more profit by lowering their prices and increasing volume.

Telecom: Intersection with Media

While the focus of this study is telecom, the distinction between telecom and media is rapidly disappearing. Voice as a fraction of communications traffic is now less than 1% in the U.S.; the remaining traffic is all data. (Hurpy 2014). In China, in 2014, 76% of all Internet traffic was video (Cisco). Internet video is driving growth in Internet traffic and investment. In response many countries have merged their telecom and media regulators. 3 However, in China this issue is unresolved.

IPTV. In China Internet Protocol Television generally refers to a package of video channels offered by an Internet Service Provider as a pay television service. In contrast, OTT (over-the-top television) is when consumers click on to videos on websites. The distinction between IPTV and OTT is blurry.

The history of IPTV licensing in China illustrates the tension between media regulator SARFT and telecom regulator MIIT. In 1999, very early days for IPTV, only SARFT, not the telecom ministry could issue licenses. In 2003, SARFT issued over 80 licenses to organizations to provide audiovisual content over the Internet. However, in 2004, SARFT reversed its position, awarding such licenses only to television stations and other media organizations previously licensed by SARFT. According to Liu and Jayakar, SARFT’s reversal was driven by propaganda policy requirements to maintain better control over the content. In 2008, when there was a government wide reshuffle, SARFT’s position was strengthened relative the telecom authorities and the State Council reiterated SARFT’s leadership over digital television (2012).

Currently, a company offering IPTV services in China requires four licenses. One license for IPTV from SARFT (State Administrations for Radio, Film, and Television), one license for content from the Ministry of Culture; and two licenses from the Ministry of Information Industry and Technology (MIIT), one for Internet content provision and, for mobile providers, one license for mobile value added service. At the end of 2011, there were about 14 million IPTV users in China. Most users were on the China Telecom trial network, for which China Telecom did not have license. Others were on the Unicom network, also without a license (Wu and Leung 2012). While license are required, some seem to operate without them. Three network convergence. For many years, the central government has sought to unify the telecom, broadcast, and Internet networks. The most recent effort began in 2010 (Wu and Leung 2012). Telecom operators were encouraged to produce and transmit television and radio shows; television and radio companies were encouraged to partner with telecom companies (Bao 2010). In June 2010, the government launched a pilot project to converge the three networks in 12 cities. This convergence of the 3 networks was identified in 2011 as an industry of national strategic significance. The following year in 2012, the pilot project was expanded to 42 cities (Wu and Leung 2012). The convergence program has two stages; 2010-2012, trials connecting broadcast and telecom networks, and 2013-2014, network architecture integration (Bao 2010). The end goal was full integration by 2015 (Wu and Leung 2012). However, by 2011, news reports suggested the three network convergence strategy was dead, as broadcast and telecom regulators fell out over the broadcast rights over programming. One Internet entrepreneur suggested in late 2011 that 60% of Chinese television programming has already migrated online, and that content censorship online is lighter weight than on television (Zhao 2011). While the regulation remains unsettled, audiences have migrated online.

Another element of convergence is the government upgrading the cable television network to digital. (Wu Leung 2012). In 2014, the China Broadcasting Network (CBN) was officially launched as the country’s fourth national network operator. CBN is a state-owned enterprise and is expected to construct, operate, and maintain a nationwide, digital cable television network (Telegeography 6/2/14).

Internet content filtering regime. Internet filtering takes place at two levels nationwide backbone Internet service providers and local Internet service providers that interact directly with Internet users. There are seven backbone providers; four smaller ones are run by the government directly, such as for scientific research or education, and the three large telecom operators, China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. Backbone providers filter content at the international gateways in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai; this prevents foreigners from seeing domestic sites and people in China from seeing foreign sites. Local Internet service providers censor content under the supervision of the local telecom authorities. They regularly carry out “strikes” against specific content (Hu 2011). Local authorities can also escape the firewall. A recent study of Chongqing documents the local government’s frustration with MIIT’s restrictions on Internet content. The Chongqing government wants to build a data center in its free trade zone that is outside the firewall in order to attract international customers. The work is still ongoing. (Graham 2015)

In the communications arena, the government is now interested in promoting the success of Chinese Internet and technology companies that are globally competitive. If content policy creates a special Chinese environment the question remains will firms grown in this ecosystem be able to compete in the global market. Electricity – market reform
"
17,Electricity and Telecom Regulation: China in Context,"This study analyzes China’s telecommunications and electricity sector from three perspectives – market reforms, regulatory reforms, and their intersection with major challenges – and places each in a global context.  Market reforms include changes in market structure, both globally and in China.  Regulatory reforms include changes in governance structure, both globally and in China, along with price reform.  For telecom, the intersection is with Internet and media; for electricity, with the environment. China has implemented reforms in both sectors with significant success in terms of massive investment and increased subscribership.  However, in both sectors there are longstanding problems that if unresolved will have significant opportunity costs in terms of growth and innovation.","The goals of electricity market reform are to improve service quality to support growth and welfare, effectively use government funds, and improve electricity access for the poor. Most countries began with a vertically integrated, state-owned electricity system. Reform begins when this system is inadequate to serve a country’s electricity needs. The two main clusters of issues are which markets should be competitive and the role of private investment (Besant Jones 2006).

Between 1990 and 2006, about half the 150 developing countries, half have started electricity reforms. Electricity markets comprise several segments: generation, transmission and distribution, and retail. A World Bank 2006 study of developing countries power sectors identified five types: (Besant Jones 2006)

1. Vertically integrated monopolies

2. Vertically integrated monopolist + independent power producers

3. Some separation between generation, transmission, and distribution

4. Single transmission company with competition in generation and distribution

5. Competitive generation, distribution, large users, and transmission

The first two are most typical. The first, more conservative approach, is to allow some private investment in independent power production, but essentially retain a vertically integrated monopoly for transmission and dispatch. The second approach is to separate the market for electricity generation from the rest of the utility and establish incentives for generators to be efficient. The generators sell electricity to a purchasing agent; prices typically include a capacity charge to cover fixed costs and an energy charge to cover variable costs. Power from generators is dispatched based on variable cost (Hunt and Shuttleworth 1996; OECD 2009).

Results are mixed and, unlike in telecom reform, there is less consensus internationally on the appropriate recipe of successful electricity reform. In a study of 36 developing and transition countries (1985-2003) Zhang (2008) found that competition was essential to better performance. Absent strong competition, an independent regulator was necessary to see gains. Furthermore, for the electricity sector, privatization alone does not lead to economic gain.

Competition in generation. For competition in generation to succeed, the government must separate generation and transmission. Otherwise, if the operator remains vertically integrated it has strong incentives to discriminate against other generators by lowering the quality of service available to them. While this is true in all network industries, particular to electricity is that a vertically integrated operator profits from charging more during congestion. Therefore, steps to reduce congestion would reduce its profits. This underscores the need for vertical separation. Transmission and distribution. Transmission (high voltage) and distribution (low voltage) are the segments where introducing competition is the most complicated. For a market with constrained electricity supply, vertical separation of generation and transmission creates opportunity for more optimal transmission planning and investment. It is more complex, however, than under a monopoly environment and requires a regulator with political independence, high expertise, good information, and sufficient authority. Leautier and Thelen’s work on reformed markets identify a range of approaches from vertically integrated systems to systems with completely independently owned and operated transmission systems. Most countries have something in between, such as legal unbundling or forcing the incumbent to separate transmission work into a different organization, while retaining ownership (Joskow 2008). Leautier and Thelen’s work suggests that in systems with congestion, vertical separation of generation and transmission combined with regulatory incentives are necessary to improve performance. Vertical separation alone is insufficient.

Retail competition. For countries with more advance regulatory regimes, there can be competition in the retail market (Hunt and Shuttleworth 2006; OECD 2009). Competition in the retail market allows consumers to benefit from a wider choice of service providers. In general, competition in retail is less common than in generation.

Privatization. The purpose of privatizing a government enterprise is to ensure that it will no longer receive more favorable treatment by the regulator and to free it to respond to market incentives. In electricity markets, not only is government ownership common, but also various levels of government may participate. Power generation plants may be owned by local or national governments. Furthermore, whether a government monopoly would be attractive for private investors depends on the degree to which that monopoly bears responsibility for universal service goals, for example (Brennan 2009). On the one hand, state-owned electricity utilities can operate at a high standard of efficiency and produce high quality service. The World Bank identifies power utilities in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore as good examples of state-owned utilities operating on commercial principles (Besant Jones 2006). Zhang’s survey shows, however, that privatization does aid in promoting competition (2015). In short, privatization may improve performance in electricity reform, but competition policy and independent regulation are a higher priority.

Electricity – market reform in China

History of state mandated market structure reform. In the 1980’s a confluence of two dynamics led to reform. First, rapid economic growth increased demand for electricity. China broke the power monopoly, allowing others to invest into power generation. Local governments and private firms invested in power generation. Second, there were economy-wide reforms to separate governing from operating businesses. Across many sectors, the business operations were separated into state-owned enterprises while policy and regulatory functions were reorganized within government. Electricity was included (OECD 2009).

After the Asian financial crisis in 1997, undercapacity became overcapacity due to declining demand. At this point in time Independent power producers (IPP’s) were more than 50% of the market. Local protectionism hurt the nationally funded power generators. This led to the reforms to establish a national power company, State Power in 1997.

In 2003, the State Power Corporation was split into five generating companies, two grid companies, and several service companies. The two grid companies were State Grid and Southern China Power Grid, both sold their generating capacity. The grid was split into two units because the government wanted to be able to use “yardstick” regulation to compare costs, for example (Int 1). Dispatch remains with the grid companies.

Competition in generation. There is competition in generation. Like many other developing countries, early on in China’s power sector reform, private investment was allowed in power generation. Private investment is allowed in generation, and some of these generators are allowed to sell directly to large customers. The 2003 reforms refocused on central government owned power plants. The five generators owned by the central government include about 40% of capacity in China; the rest are owned by primarily by consortia at the local government level (OECD 2009). In recent years, the percentage of total power output of the five big power generators is increasing.

Modest competition in retail. For residential users, there is no significant competition in the retail market. However, since 2002, as a pilot project, large users of electricity have been able to buy directly from generators (Dupuy). The 2015 proposed reforms push forward on competition in electricity generation and retail. On the generation side, allowing large users to purchase electricity from generators will create some competition and would make the grid an access carrier. (Kahrl).

Transmission and distribution. The two state-owned grid companies each have a monopoly in their respective regions. In the 2003 market reform, while State Power Corporation was split up, distribution, transmission, and dispatch remain under the ownership of the grid operators (OECD 2009). There are seven regional networks (Northeast, Northwest, East, Central, South, and Guangdong) and five provincial networks (Shandong, Fujian, Xinjiang, Hainan, and Tibet) (OECD 2009). The South China Power Grid controls South and Guangdong. The much larger State Power Grid controls all the others. In rural areas, some independent companies may have distribution networks where the national grid does not reach (Pittman and Zhang 2010). State Grid is responsible for interregional dispatch, while each regional grid subsidiary has its own dispatch center (OECD 2009). The electricity grid in China is not yet integrated, which makes challenging the development of regional wholesale markets and the transmission of electricity from the resource rich West to the power hungry East. To integrate this fragmented grid, the government is constructing three major east-west transmission corridors in the north, central, and south (Pittman and Zhang 2010).

The State Grids are profitable. They buy and sell electricity at favorable regulated prices and keep the difference. The government does not use a cost-based approach to determine the share of revenue the grids keep. While revenues have increased dramatically in the last 20 years, costs have risen more slowly (Kahrl 2015). In contrast, for example, coal-burning electricity generators face a regulated price for a limited amount of coal, but beyond that face the international market price.

Distributed generation-microgrids Distributed generation offers a modest opportunity to introduce some competition in China’s transmission and distributed market. Policy measures in China to support distributed generation were accelerated in 2013 when the US raised taxes on importing solar panels from China. To support China’s solar panel manufacturing companies, the government took measures to create a domestic market for solar. (Kahrl 2015).

While large scale solar projects tend to be in western China, with more land and space but less demand, distributed generation solar projects tend to be in the east. Distributed generation projects are on or close to the user site, the electricity is directly consumed by the user, and requires no additional transmission lines (Zhang 2015). Most likely projects would be industrial parks or suburban agricultural land development. (Dupuy 2015) For example, property developers in China who are often now responsible for building the gas and water infrastructure can now consider building their own electricity system, whereas previously they were forced to rely on the grid (Mah 2015).

Two major changes resulting from the 2013 policies. First, the government provided a subsidy to operate, as well as construct, solar systems. Second, the government raised the maximum size of a project from 6MW to 20 MW. Despite these incentives, Zhang (2015) demonstrates that as of 2014, DG PV has been slow to develop. Practical barriers include the prevalence of roofs too weak to carry a system and complicated building ownership arrangements. Regulatory issues include residential electricity prices that are too low to make investment worthwhile, few incentives for grid companies to cooperate, and a complex government permitting process (Zhang 2015). Distributed generation as an alternative paradigm to a national grid system is a long term, not short term possibility in China.

Electricity – regulatory reform Independent regulator. As governments recognized the advantages of private investment in electricity, separating the regulatory authority from state-owned operators was one way to help assure private investors they would been on an even footing when it came to regulatory decisions. 4 The degree to which a government pursues privatization, this helps assure private investors of the independence of the regulator. However, in electricity, most countries still have prominent public ownership in this sector. More pertinent to the independence of the electricity regulator is whether it has the resources to monitor and analyze the market and, finally, the authority to take action.

A review of the literature on electricity regulators underscores that dynamic interaction between market competition and good, independent `regulation. In a survey of developing and transition countries, privatization or regulation on their own did little to improve performance of the electricity sector. Competition, especially in generation, improved performance most. When competition was weak, good regulation helped achieve gains in generation. The elements of independence tested in the study were (1) whether there was an electricity law, (2) whether the regulatory claimed to be independent, (3) whether the head of the regulator has a fixed term appointment, and (4) whether the regulator is financed by license fees rather than government funding. Finally, they conclude that an independent regulator without privatization is ineffective, probably due to deep-rooted conflict of interest (Zhang et al 2008).

In a contrasting approach, Haney and Politt concluded that regulators of competitive markets were more likely to use methods considered “best practice.” They conducted a survey of 40 regulators in 40 countries in 2008 to determine whether they use benchmarking, typically used to set prices for regulated firms. They found that countries with a large numbers of firms were more likely to use benchmarking, made it easier for regulators to apply this practice. This suggests that a competitive market makes it easier to be a good regulator. Second, they found that regulators with more years of experiences and less subject to political intervention were more likely to use this best practice. Third, they found regional trends; regulators look to their neighbors as examples of good practice (2011).

However, sector reform alone is not enough to improve sector performance. A review of 27 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, found that power sector reform alone had little impact on economic outcomes. However, power sector reform in combination with other infrastructure and broader reforms, such as in the financial sector, had impact. Finally, privatization under weak governance – pursued to reduce deficit or grater revenue – could have a negative impact (Nepal, et al 2012). Relationship of national and local authorities. In electricity it is common for local authorities to have a prominent role in forecasting and planning. Whatever tensions there may be between national, regional, and municipal authorities in general are then replicated in electricity regulation. Local officials are especially keen to make sure electricity generated locally meets local needs first.

Relationships among power generators - Balancing load and managing dispatch. Electricity is expensive to store, therefore, delivering power from where it is generated to where it is needed in the proper time is a key function of the system. This is a characteristic unique to electricity, different from other utilities like telecom or water, for example. A secondary function is the ability to provide emergency power should the network fail or demand spike in some way (Brennan 2009). The regulator must decide the responsibilities of generators and grid operators.

Electricity – regulatory reform in China

Separate regulator from industry. Before 1997, the Ministry of Electric Power was the regulatory, policymaker, and service provider for the country. In 1997, the electricity operations were assigned to the State Power Corporation of China. After several organization shuffles, in 2002 SERC was created as an autonomous regulator that reports directly to the State Council, which elevated its authority. SERC had strategy and regulatory responsibility, but little else. National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) Energy Bureau had responsibility for planning policy and development, and to approve major investments in generation and transmission. The NDRC pricing department kept authority to set electricity prices. State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was the owner of state-owned enterprises, and responsible for personnel decisions, public listing of enterprises, and their merger and acquisition. In 2008, the National Energy Administration combined the Energy Bureau, the State Energy Office, and the nuclear power administration (OECD 2009). In March 2012, SERC was disbanded and reintegrated into the National Energy Administration (NEA). NEA drafts and implements energy strategies, plans, and policies, and regulates. NEA will remain under the jurisdiction of the NDRC (Xinhua 3/10/13 and 3/26/13).

In short, there are few observers who would describe the regulator as independent. In China, both the corporate and government sectors are organized in a single administrative hierarchy. In many instances, corporate executives outrank regulatory officials in the administration hierarchy (Kahrl 2015). Whereas regulators in other countries often rely on market forces to regulate, in China, the regulator relies on the State-Owned Enterprises to execute regulatory decisions (Mah 2015). For more effective regulation of the sector, the government has concluded that it needs a more comprehensive, rather than independent regulator. Disconnect between needs and project approvals. In many countries, there is a regulatory process to periodically evaluate demand for electricity, resources for power generation, capital for investment, and plan future projects accordingly. In China, the provincial governments that have the greatest incentives to increase power generation. They would like to be able to attract investors by guaranteeing reliable electricity (Mah 2015). Nevertheless, local authorities could not approve power projects themselves. Until recently all projects had to be approved at the central level in Beijing. (Kahrl 2015) There is little focus on forecasting demand and assessing resources, and even less attention given to demand side management or grid resources. Instead, local authorities pour their attention into getting central level approval, a process that incentives rent-seeking behavior and corruption (Kahrl 2015). In the end, there is little connection between the approval of individual projects and the larger energy picture. So, in 2015, while there is an overcapacity of electricity generation, coal power generation projects continue to get approval (Kahrl 2015). New policies announced in 2015 that shift project approval decision making to the local level may alleviate this (Kahrl 2015).

New goals. In early 2015, the government announced the focus of energy reform would be to improve air quality; this was the most significant reform program announced since 2002. Unusually, it was a joint announcement by the State Council and the Communist Party Central Committee, sending a powerful political signal. (Dupuy 2015) Such strong political signals are necessary for state-owned enterprises to deliver (Mah 2015).

Relationship of local and national authorities. Local authorities want to be able to offer and ideally, guarantee, reliable electricity service to investors and to the population in general. Therefore, they have the strongest incentive to see that sufficient power generation projects are in place and willingness to absorb cost in the case of overcapacity. Also, local authorities have the flexibility to implement policies suitable for local conditions. Mah and Hills’ series of studies on Guangdong, Beijing, and Xinjiang wind energy policy demonstrate the significant influence of provincial authorities. In terms of pricing policy, Guangdong was able to countermand a central government policy of competitive bidding, with a fixed price approach that gave investors a better incentive to install wind projects. A few years later, the central government abandoned competitive bidding for a fixed price approach (2008, 2014b). In research and development, Shanghai’s more well-developed civil society organizations for science and technology enabled local companies like Sewind to close the technology gap with sector leaders. Guangdong’s contrasting approach was to level the playing field for a large number of players instead of backing a few winners. (2014a). This diversity only takes place in a larger context of clear national directives, however.

Balancing load and managing dispatch. The dispatch system is organized to support a mainly coal-powered generation. From the 1980’s, China allocated operating hours equally among generators, an approach known as “equal shares dispatch,” or average dispatch. The wholesale prices faced by generators was based on the financial lifetime of the unit, each generator needed to produce enough to cover a regulated rate of return. These returns were achieved by provincial Economic Commissions setting administrative quotas of hours for each generator (Kahrl 2013). The consequences of such a system were, for example, in the 1980’s even though there were power shortages, generators were guaranteed a number of hours to run. More efficient plants were not favored over others. In 2007, pilot programs began to increase power generation efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Instead of every generator receiving equal hours, as long as safety and reliability were not compromised, dispatch priority would to go renewables and hydropower first, followed by nuclear, and then followed by coal, natural gas and oil. In December 2010, China Southern began applying the pilot to all of its five provinces (Kahrl 2013).

Electricity Pricing Retail pricing. Industrial consumers comprise about 80% demand for electricity in China; residential consumers make up the remaining 20% (Dupuy 2015). On the whole, industrial consumers face relatively high prices for electricity compared to other countries, while residential users face lower prices compared to other countries . This kind of cross-subsidization of the residential consumer is common in many countries and, once in place, is politically difficult to change. The reasons for keeping residential tariffs low are to keep electricity access affordable for as many people as possible and to protest users from inflation (OECD 2009).

Network pricing. The government sets prices for electricity sold by power generators to the grid companies. These tariffs directly influence investment in generation and reflect the policy priorities of the time. Prior to 1984 power generation prices were internal transfers within a vertically integrated system. In 1985 the government started tariffing based on the financial lifetime of the generator. Plants with better repayment terms received a higher, more favorable tariff (Kahrl 2013). The policy goal was to increase investment in generation without government funds (OECD 2009). Beginning in 2001, tariffs were set based on the operational lifetime of the generator (Kahrl 2013). Furthermore, plants built before 1985 were given tariffs that covered only operational, not fixed costs. In short, new power plants received favorable tariffs compared to older ones (Pittman and Zhang 2010).

In 2004, the government began setting tariffs based on coal prices. Coal-fired generators face two prices for coal. Generators can purchase coal at below-market rates up to a limited quantity. Beyond that, generators buy coal at a rate determined by the international market (Kahrl 2013). Maintaining a below market rate for a limited amount of coal reflects the government’s concern with minimizing upward price fluctuations. Allowing market-rate coal purchases reflects the government’s concern with shortages. In 2007, the government lowered on-grid tariffs for small, inefficient coalpowered generators. Most of these units have now been taken out of service (Ma 2011). As China’s government makes environmental goals a higher priority, on regulatory reform to watch are moves to increase on-grid tariffs that favor renewables relative coal.

Relationship between network and retail prices. Coal-fired generators face market prices for coal, on the one hand, and government-set tariffs to sell their electricity to the grid, on the other. From 2002-2008, for example, coal prices rose while the government held down retail tariffs. In 2008, power shortages occurred due to a combination of a cold winter and curtailed supply because of low retail tariffs (OECD 2009).

Liu’s study of the relationship between coal and retail electricity prices from 1995-2011 shows that residential electricity rates rose quickly with coal prices, but were rigid downward when coal prices dropped. For industrial electricity prices, however, there was no such asymmetry; coal and electricity prices fluctuated together (2013). This reflects the generation condition that residential users are subsidized by industrial users.

Grid companies keep the difference between the cost of on-grid tariffs and revenue from retail tariffs. The grid companies’ own costs are not transparent. However, revenues from electricity sales likely outpace rise in costs in recent years, making the grid companies very powerful and a target of reform (Kahrl 2015). In Shenzhen, the provincial government proposed to review Southern Grid Company’s costs periodically and allow it retain a fixed percent of costs as profit. This is a cost-plus approach typical in many other countries’ regulatory regimes.

Another approach to unmasking grid costs is to create alternatives to the state grid companies’ transmission and distribution service. The direct purchase program, whereby large electricity users purchase electricity directly from generators, and the microgrid policies are two such policies that may shed light on transmission costs. Recently announced plans for retail competition may clarify costs of retail distribution.

Pricing is an important regulatory tool used to meet a cluster of oftencompeting objectives, from economic growth, clean environment, low inflation, safety to reliability. The challenge is whether there is enough good information and the skill to analyze it to achieve as much as possible.

Electricity: Intersection with Environment

Changing gears. The power sector in any country is a major contributor to environmental pollutants, and in China the institutional arrangements to improve environmental quality are still new. Market and regulatory electricity reform have already been very challenging when the goal was simply to fuel economic growth. Failure to reform now means not only economic costs, but also broader health, social, and political costs to the country. The State Council released in March 2015 a new framework that prioritized environmental goals in power sector reform (State Council 2015). In China the only scalable energy resources are coal and hydropower. Coal is 80% of electricity generation and at the core of the environmental problems in China. The entire system is set up to support coal generation, for example the dispatch system, and changing gears is not easy. (Kahrl)

A result of decades of reform, investment in and operation of power generators is decentralized, while planning and price-setting are centralized. This system was designed to raise capital for investment in order to meet technology and performance targets. This system does not create incentives for efficiency – in the use of capital, natural resources, or electricity itself. The current regulatory system lacks the usual tools necessary to make adjustments in policies that would improve the environment (Kahrl 2011). In short, a major aspect of environmental policy – power sector reform – is not possible until market and regulatory reforms, especially price reform, gain traction. Possible other tools include subsidies, retrofitting plants, transmission investment, price regulations, and demand side management.

Subsidies. Currently, there are massive fossil fuel subsidies, primarily through prices set below costs. In 1999, the IEA estimated the average rate of energy subsidies was 10.9% (Lin and Jiang 2011). According to estimates by Liu and Li, in 2007 subsidies to 357 billion yuan, about 1.43% GDP. These subsidies lead to overconsumption of power and shift industry to move toward more energy-intensive production methods (Liu and Li 2011).

Technical retrofitting. The policy of closing down small, inefficient, and high polluting generators had has the dual effect of increasing average efficiency of generators and reducing pollution. While several studies argue that unbundling reforms, separating the State Power Corporation into smaller power companies, and 2 grid companies, is responsible for increased efficiency (Zhao 2013, Du 2013), Ma also argues that technological retrofitting of these generators contributed as much to increase in efficiency (2015).

Transmission. A further challenge to lessening the impact of the electricity sector on the environment is the underinvestment in the electrical grid. Flow among the regional grids is very limited. Energy resources and centers of demand are in different regions. Coal is abundant in the north. There is ample wind in the north and northeast. Significant hydropower is in the central and south regions. However, the load centers that demand power are concentrated in the east. Since inter-grid flows are limited, natural resources like coal have to be physically transported to grids with load centers. Furthermore, renewable resources like wind and hydro cannot be effectively transmitted outside their region, severely curtailing the usefulness of any investment in their development (Kahrl 2011). Price regulation - grid business model. Shenzhen has begun a pilot to change the business model of Southern Grid. Every three years, the provincial authority will review the assets of Southern Grid; the grid company will receive a percentage of its expenses as revenue, a rate of return model. This approach protects Southern Grid revenue if it becomes more efficient. Previously, there was no oversight of Southern Grid’s costs. In the first review of the grid’s costs, about one-quarter of its assets were disallowed as not relevant to the electricity and transmission. In principle, if Southern Grid becomes more efficient, savings will be passed on to users. In early 2015, the national government announced this approach would be adopted in several other provinces. (Dupuy 2015, Weston 2015, Huang 2015).

Price regulation – coal. In the early 2000’s, a shortage of coal, exacerbated by bottle necks in coal rail transport, caused wholesale rates to rise. In 2008, they rose twice, while retail rates remain unchanged. The loss was born by the generators and the grid operators (Ma 2640).

Price regulation – dispatch. Changing the dispatch system to incorporate renewables will create winners and losers and shift investment decisions (Dupuy 2015, Kahrl 2015). One common approach is to create a tariff that compensates the generator separately for both fixed and variable costs. A feed-in tariff that based on variable costs is favorable for renewables will not enough revenue for coal-fired generation to maintain investment. Creating a capacity fee based on fixed costs would address this issue. While this tariff structure is common in other countries, it not used China. (Kahrl). Such tariff structure would redistribute revenues among the current players and would require some consultation and consensus to be accepted.

Demand side management Policy and regulation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewables are supply side issues. On the demand side, reducing electricity use by consumers can also have a positive effect on the environment.

In Zheng, et al (2014), conducted a survey of 1450 households in 26 provinces on their residential energy consumption in 2012. Two policies in particular came to light – time-of-use pricing policy and energy efficient appliances. Of the households surveyed, 61% had refrigerators and 44% had clothes washers that had grade 1-3 efficiency labels, suggesting this policy is effective but could be promoted more. Second, in those cities surveyed with time-of-use pricing policy – higher electricity prices at peak times and seasons, designed to encourage distribute household usage and promote conservation, only 38% of surveyed were aware of it and only 14% had applied for it. Tellingly, only 13% of the surveyed had heard about it from the grid company.

In the longer run, the broad discussion of smart grids fits into this discussion of demand side management. In many parts of China, smart meters have been installed in households as part the routine replacement of meters (Mah 2015). With smart meters it is possible for the grid company to implement dynamic pricing charging different electricity rates for different times of day or year – and it is possible for households to be more efficient users. For these kinds of policies to be effective, however, people will have to overcome the kind of information challenges. Electric vehicles also present a demand side management opportunity. If vehicle use was widespread, price incentives could be used to balance electricity demand, perhaps during non-peak times (Dupuy 2015). Again, this is an opportunity for the long term.

Conclusion: China’s regulation in context

In both telecom and electricity, the large state-owned players are not so much subject to regulation as they are tools of regulation. In general, they execute the goals and reflect the priorities of the state. Seen from this perspective, when state-owned operators do not conform to announced public policies, they are reflecting conflicts embedded in the government itself.

Even so, any major change in regulatory direction substantially shifts the distribution of resources, profits, and influence among the players – whether ministries, State Council organs, state-owned enterprises, or private companies. Problems like interconnection in telecom, or dispatch in electricity go to the core of this balancing act. Changing the balance requires some fundamental consensus. One thing missing in China’s efforts at consensus building is a broadly based consultative process. Consultation is kept within the confines of a select community. Innovation from outside has little opportunity for expression.

Telecom market reform. China challenges the international consensus that an independent regulatory regime is necessary for market growth. However, a better regulatory regime might have let to even more growth. China confirms that where there is more competition – in mobile and Internet applications – there is more innovation. The question of how media companies can be part of this is a major issue.

Telecom regulatory reform. Interconnection problems persist – related to the strength and skill of the regulator and the state-owned nature of the incumbents. Holding back the licensing of IPTV and other audiovisual services over the Internet may dampen innovation, although some services are launching despite the restrictions.

Electricity market reform. Reforms in China are roughly in line with international practices, which itself are scattered. China has a special focus on counterbalancing the State Grid companies, not necessarily shared by other countries. Also, international practice is focused more on demand side management, which China appears to be at early stages of exploring.

Electricity regulatory reform. Planning and pricing are not in step with international practice. The dual pricing of coal for on-plan and off-plan is reminiscent of market planning during the time of command economy. Modern techniques for managing load and dispatch are not yet implemented.

Success of the SOE-oriented approach. The great success of telecom and electricity industries in the last two decades is universal service. Everywhere in China there are phones and electricity. Compared to other countries of comparable level of development, this is a remarkable achievement and a great boon to the quality of life for ordinary Chinese. At least in telecommunications, the next step in universal service is consider affordability. Jayakar and Liu (2014) make the point that while for telecom there is geographic universal service, demographically there is not; low income and other isolated groups do not have the same level of telecom subscribership as others. This is a challenge commonplace among wealthy countries.

Challenge to innovation. A thorough examination of electricity and telecom regulation uncovers many problems with noncompliance. The rules are written one way, and the reality in the market is another. This is a kind of innovation, albeit an illegal one. One approach would be to increase enforcement. Another would be to relax the rules make these kinds of innovation legal. A third approach would be more extensive consultation prior to implementing rules; first, to improve them through feedback, and second, to inform the market of their importance. Ultimately, business and technological innovation are easier when the regulatory environment is rational and predictable.

Whether state-owned enterprises can be looked to for innovation remains to be seen. In the literature on electricity and telecom regulation, privatization is considered important to improving market performance, but secondary to competition and regulation. In telecommunications, however, it appears at the moment that the Internet application market is the most innovative, the telecom market segment that is not dominated by SOE’s. Also, there is the question of innovation for whom? As the Mariscal and Rivera (2005) study show, regulations that produce a national champion may produce few benefits for consumers at home; and rules that improve quality of life for people at home, may not support a national champion abroad."
18,"Electricity demand response in China: Status, feasible market schemes and pilots","Demand Response (DR) has been extensively developed and implemented in the US and Europe. However, DR hardly exists in many developing countries for similar problems such as rigid power market and state monopoly. With the increasing imbalance between supply and demand in China's power industry, the government has issued new policies on DR and approved the first batch of pilot cities. China is setting a good example of how to encourage DR under monopolistic electric market and open up the market to aggregators and DR suppliers. This paper summarizes the current DR status, feasible DR market schemes and DR pilot projects in China. First, electric power system reform, renewable energy policies and power industry development are reviewed, highlighting the problems associated with the current dispatch mechanisms of DR policies and markets. New DR programs and DR-related policies are also introduced. On this basis, the driving forces and challenges associated with DR in China are analyzed. The major challenge is the lack of a suitable market mechanism for the current Chinese power industry. Hence, this paper presents six feasible strategies that fully utilize the existing policies. Additionally, the latest DR applications in different pilot cities are summarized and analyzed.","1. Introduction

The booming economy in China has resulted in a surging demand for electricity. With escalating demand and increased investments in renewable energy generation, electricity supplydemand mismatch is becoming increasingly prominent [1]. The power grid in China has exhibited higher peak loads, and the peakvalley difference has gradually widened. Especially during extreme weather events, network operation may be seriously jeopardized. There are two approaches to minimizing this threat: enlarging the peak regulation capacity from the supply side or implementing a demand response (DR) to relieve the pressure associated with peak loads [2]. Wang et al. [3] stated that peak shaving by means of demand-side bidding could yield greater economic beneﬁts than operating at peak load by comparing the electricity price models of the two schemes. In addition, renewable energy has gradually attracted attention in China, whereas its integration to the grid is hard due to the feature of intermittency [4]. Currently, coal-ﬁred reserve units are mostly used to offset the utilization of renewable energy because renewable energy is less reliable. Continually increasing coal-ﬁred power plant capacities would result in the lower utilization rate of the renewable power generation. However, DR resources could promote the integration of renewable energy into the power grid, reducing the installation of units and the expansion of transmission lines.

DR, a measure used in certain circumstances (such as network congestion or emergency situations), has been extensively developed in the US and Europe, whereas it has only recently gained attention in China [5,6]. It can be deﬁned as “changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized.” [7] DR also refers to a wide range of actions which can be taken at the customer side of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system (such as peak period network congestion or high prices) [5]. Unlike DR, Demand side management (DSM), which has been introduced in china for approximate thirty years [8], is a relatively broader concept that incorporates many actions, ranging from the replacement of energy-efﬁcient appliances to the reduction of energy consumption to the shifting of times when electricity is used to the implementation of complex dynamic pricing mechanisms [9]. It can be universally divided into two categories: energy conservation and DR. Energy conservation is an approach that cuts the power load and promotes long-term stability, whereas DR is the most effective approach for minimizing temporal or short-term electricity shortages, which can be devastating (see Fig. 1).

DR can be generally categorized into price-based programs (also

called time-based retail rates) and incentive-based programs [6]. Moreover, DR encompasses another special category in China that focuses on policy-guided programs because the Chinese power industry is currently based on the model of a vertically integrated monopoly. As the name implies, policy-guided programs are launched by administrations and serve as key measures of current demand side management (DSM) in China, which mainly focuses on mitigating the power deﬁcit. The time-of-use tariff and tiered tariff are also widely used throughout the nation, but incentivebased DRs have not been used in any grid market in China, excluding pilot studies.

In July 2012, China's Ministry of Finance (MOC) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) jointly put forth “Interim Measures for management of central government funding for cities piloting DSM” [10], supporting the development of the power demand response, including scientiﬁc research, publicity, training, evaluation and assessment. For example, it explicitly states that DR participants are awarded ¥100 (15.4USD) for each kW load curtailment during the peak periods. In November 2012, Suzhou, Beijing, Tangshan and Foshan were approved to become the ﬁrst batch of cities piloting DSM based on the respective reported implementation plans [11]. The pilot cities are capable of adopting ﬂexible DR policies, taking full advantage of the time-ofuse tariff and differential power pricing to achieve peak load shifting and power supply and demand equilibrium dynamically. These pilots also consider critical peak pricing and interruptible tariffs to develop in-depth and well-rounded DR. However, most efforts have focused on medium- and long-term curtailment in these pilot cities, while the quick and short-term DR was investigated until 2014. According to the NDRC requirements, an experimental program was conducted in Shanghai, which was the ﬁrst short and fast domestic DR application. On April 9, 2015, NDRC together with MOC proclaimed the “Announcement concerning the improvement of the power emergency mechanism and the trial work on DSM in pilot cities” [12]. It also indicated that effective long-term mechanisms should be established, and speciﬁc characteristics should be highlighted based on the previous DSM pilot programs in Beijing, Suzhou, Tangshan and Foshan and the DR pilot program in Shanghai. These actions suggest that DR is becoming increasingly valued in China and is shifting from conceptualization to implementation.

Wang et al. [13] reviewed the DR in China in 2010, analyzed the scenario and made suggestions for DR implementation at that time. Nevertheless, dramatic DR changes have occurred over the past four years in China due to not only new policies but also approval of the ﬁrst pilot cities nationwide. Especially during the past two years, experimental programs in pilot cities have been implemented under the current power industry mechanism, building momentum for future development in China. Hence, it can be concluded that current DR exploration in China is a critical phase bridging the preceding implementation and subsequent large-scale implementation. Some scholars have published papers pertaining to DSM in China. Zhou et al. presented a study of the DSM and DR programs in China in the context of China's power industry reform [9]. Zeng et al. [14] also analyzed DSM development in China. However, their reviews emphasized DSM as a whole instead of management speciﬁc to DR in China because at that time, little attention had been given to DR. The major difference between this paper and the abovementioned relevant DSM studies is that this paper focuses on the current, state-of-the-art DR programs in China and presents suitable strategies for DR mechanisms on that basis. Section 2 summarizes the problems that the power industry faces and pinpoints the disadvantages of the current power dispatch mechanism. Section 3 explains the current status of DR in China, including a summary of previous DR studies, DR policies and the current motivation for and challenges associated with implementing DR in China. Section 4 suggests several feasible DR strategies based on previous studies and current circumstances. Speciﬁc emphasis is placed on the latest DR pilot programs in China in Section 5. In Section 6, the study's primary conclusions are presented.

2. Chinese electricity market: status, problems and solutions

2.1. Status quo of Chinese electricity industry

With rapid economic growth, China has observed a dramatic increase in power generation and consumption in recent decades. Fig. 2 illustrates that both power generation capacity and power demand in China have grown rapidly over the past twenty years [15]. The structure of the Chinese power system is still dominated by fossil fuels, especially coal, and renewable energy only accounts for a small share of total power generation [9,16,17]. However, the structure of power generation in China is changing [18]. The ratio of thermal power generation in total declines annually from 2000 on, dropping from 82% to 65.4% in 2014.

In spite of its high generation cost, renewable energy is more eco-friendly and yields greater social beneﬁts than does coal-ﬁred power generation [19]. China has established the use of renewable energy sources as a strategic plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Due to the establishment of China's “Renewable Energy Act”, renewable energy has expanded rapidly over the last decade [21e23]. In recent years, increasing manufacturing capacities and decreasing costs have led to remarkable solar growth [24]. Additionally, nuclear power has rapidly developed in China [25]. The shares of installed capacities associated with different energy sources in 2014 are illustrated in Fig. 3.

By 2013, China's installed capacity overtook the US capacity, reaching 12.5 billion kilowatts. At the end of 2015, the installed capacity was more than 14.6 billion kilowatts, reﬂecting a 7.5% annual growth. Due to feed-in tariff adjustments, wind power investments exceeded those in the hydroelectric, thermal and nuclear sectors. Photovoltaic grid-connected systems exhibited impressive growth based on installed capacity and power output, while thermal power generation declined [26].

As estimated by both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Chinese government [27], large-scale generation capacity expansion would still be required to support the rapid economic development and satisfy the increasing power demand in China over the next two decades. Currently, China faces a unique dilemma regarding the development of the power industry:

First, now that China's renewable energy industry is booming, resolving obstacles associated with integrated the renewable energy sources into the power grid is becoming increasingly critical as a result of their randomness, ﬂuctuations and uncontrollability.

Second, the annual working hours of thermal power generators continue to decrease due to the rapid increase in installed capacity, as depicted in Fig. 4 from 2001 to 2014. The average utilization of power equipment in 2014 fell to the lowest level since 1978, totaling 4286 h [28].

Third, power supply strains due to extreme climate events and machinery maintenance still occur frequently. For example, although the discrepancy between power supply and demand in 2014 was less serious than in 2013 because of cool weather and a declining economy, power shortages still occurred in North China [28].

In turn, DR can facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the power grid. DR can effectively shift peak loads and alleviate temporal power shortages. It is a promising approach for overcoming the issues that exist in the current power industry and shows great potential in China.

2.2. China's electric power market system

China's power sector has long been blamed for its high degree of administrative monopoly, improper government interference and insufﬁcient market competition in the past [29]. To change this situation, nationwide power industry reform has occurred over the past two decades, which intends to gradually open up the China's power market and form a competitive market mode facilitating the development of DR [30]. In this section, the process of the power system reform is presented, with the demerits of the current power market pinpointed. It is noted that the electric power system reform is not an overnight change, and we need to assess the social beneﬁts of DR in current China's power market. Therefore, the estimation of implementing DR in Shanghai is illustrated in Section 2.2.3.

2.2.1. Electric power system reform The Ministry of Power ceased to exist in 1998 and was replaced by State Power Corporation (SPC), whose goal is to overhaul and streamline power grids [31]. In December 2012, the former SPC was split into ﬁve power generation groups and two state grid companies (State Power Grid and China Southern Power Grid), separating the power generators from the grid operators [32]. Different generation groups provide power products to users through power grid bidding. Thus, the relationship between the supply and demand determines the price of the electricity, and the competitive market exposes the power producers to the uncertainties of market demand [33]. However, the power market is still based on a monopolized power grid, with both a sole buyer and sole seller. As for the power producers, the grid companies are the single buyers, while for the end-use customers, the grid companies become the sole seller [9]. In 2015, the State Council issued “the Several Opinions on Further Deepening the Power System Reform” and noted some key problems, such as the lack of a market mechanism and pricing system [34].

Since initiating reform in 1998, an open and competitive power market has not yet been formed. Government functions will play crucial roles in DR implementation based on the current electric power system.

2.2.2. Disadvantages of the current power market system An electric power market mainly consists of four parts: power generation, transmission, distribution and end-use customers. In China, grid companies serve as the sole buyer from the generation side and the sole seller to the user side, undertaking the roles of power transmission, distribution, selling and dispatching and monopolizing both sides (see Fig. 5).

Dispatch and management by the State Grid are the principal methods used to maintain market equilibrium. Power grid dispatch is based on a uniform power price, called benchmark price, which is ﬁxed at all times, as shown in Table 1. The generation side is limited by the uniﬁed control of the State Grid.

When power shortages occur, increasing supply (by increasing generation output) or reducing demand (by DR) are the feasible methods used to achieve a real-time balance. In China, increasing the supply is the only approach before DR implementation, i.e., more power plants are being built to satisfy the demands and peak loads. This results in many unused plants during off-peak periods. Still, the ﬁve generation companies continue to build new plants because under the current dispatch mechanism, building more plants is the only solution. The State Grid companies have to purchase power products from the newly built plants during off-peak periods to ensure that they remain economical, reducing the utilization hours of existing plants even further. Indeed, the current power dispatching mechanism of the State Grid is not based on market driven behavior. The inevitable consequences associated with the consistently decreasing utilization rates of existing plants and the considerable investments in newly built power plants will eventually be suffered by terminal users.

The dispatching mechanism will not be able to cope with the growing social demands and the increasing gap between peak loads and valley loads for various reasons. The dispatching mechanism could mitigate the problem of peak-valley power difference, but it brings about tremendous social losses. First, the average utilization rates of power plants continue to fall, and the intermittent operation of equipment has made them vulnerable to damage. Second, small units in backup plants consume more coal than large units that generate the same amount of power, leading to a continuous increase in coal consumption per unit generating capacity. Third, power plant construction wastes land resources. Finally, power grid expansion results in the decrease in the power generation utilization rate, the increased maintenance and repair costs, as well as grid losses.

In summary, there has long been concern associated with increasing the supply in China's power dispatching mechanism, resulting in the potentially effective DR being ignored. This is because the State Grid acts as the single power seller for end-use customers. Therefore, proﬁts can still be guaranteed through directly increasing purchase prices of terminal users in the case of increasing costs. However, insufﬁcient understanding of DR, particularly lacking regarding the potential proﬁts of DR, is another major cause.

2.2.3. Economic beneﬁt evaluation of DR in China under the current market system DR can serve as a virtual power back-up plant that averts and reduces the peak load. However, the current dispatching mechanism focuses on building more power plants and expanding the power grid to meet the load. In this section, using Shanghai as a case study, a DR beneﬁt estimation is presented based on the current power mechanism in China. Issues related to short supply were partly mitigated by the favorable climate (see Fig. 6) in 2014.

However, the huge difference between the peak load and valley loads still exists. The highest electric power load reaches 26 GW, while the lowest only reaches 8 GW. The total hours at more than 90% peak load only amount to 90 h, accounting for only 1% of the whole year. However, there are 7400 h at 40e70% of the peak power load. The installed capacity of local power plants in Shanghai totals 15 GW, and power purchasing outside of Shanghai is approximately 10e15 GW. The purchasing power amount is determined in the beginning of the year and it has the priority to the power generated by the local plants. That is to say, the local power plants are complemented according to the original dispatching mechanism. As a consequence, they are almost reduced to back-up plants during off-peak periods when power purchasing is sufﬁcient.

According to the statistical data from the latest cost handbook [35], the average cost of setting up a gas turbine power plant is approximately 3000 CNY/kW, and the cost of a coal-ﬁred power plant is 4500 CNY/kW. The corresponding power grid construction cost is approximately 1000 CNY/kW [35]. A peak load power plant consumes 380e500 g/kWh of coal, and a common power plant consumes 290e340 g/kWh of coal [36]. The empirical evidence demonstrates that DR is able to realize a 3%e9% peak load shift [6]. Therefore, in this case, a 5% (approximately 1.35 GW) peak load is assumed to shift to a valley, and the total electricity sales remain the same. Thus, the costs from expansion of the power grid for peak shifting can be saved. Detailed calculations of the beneﬁt estimation of DR are summarized in Table 2.

From the above analysis, a savings of approximately 123 billion RMB from power plant buildup, power grip construction and the coal consumption can be obtained by shifting 5% of peak load based on DR. Since the power load shifts from the peak to the valley, the total electricity sales will not change substantially. And this amount of savings can be used for the construction of DR systems, the customer tapping and DR incentives, etc.

On the other hand, DR enhances the utilization of generating equipment and increases the usage hours of the power grid, prolonging the lifetimes of units and reducing maintenance fees. DR saves the relevant land resources by not building up new power plants.

It is noted that the largest problem brought about by China's dispatching system lies in that it fulﬁlls the peak load by expansion of the power grid. The presented cases only evaluates the biggest contributors to the savings. The overall beneﬁts of DR needs to be further investigated by considering the factors such as payback effects, cash ﬂow mapping and so forth.

3. Status quo of DR in China

3.1. Current DR programs in China

Due to the long-term monopoly condition in China, the related DR is largely dependent on the power policies. As mentioned in Section 1, current Chinese DR programs can be divided into pricebased programs, incentive-based programs and policy-guided programs. More details are summarized in Table 3.

In price-based programs, users consume less power at times of maximum demand, resulting in lower prices at other times [37,38]. The pricing mechanism is important for implementing successful DR programs, especially during the initial phase of implementation [39].

Among the price-based programs, time-of-use tariff is adopted in the retail side nationwide except in Tibet, which is shifting to a market-driven approach to load management. With reference to the domestic policies, the price difference between the peak and valley loads varies regionally. Normally, the peak rates are 2e5 times higher than off-peak rates. It was estimated that 21.86 GW was shifted by the time-of-use tariff in 2014, accounting for 73% of the power gap; the average load rate of the power grid was 85.72% and increased 1.84% over the last year [40]. In addition, eight

provinces also adopt CPP strategies [41]. Four provinces that are rich in hydroelectric resources have already implemented seasonof-use prices [41].

The two-part pricing strategy was originally designed for industrial enterprises. The tariff is generally divided into two parts: the basic tariff and the used tariff. The basic tariff is based on the load demand which users sign up contracts with utility companies [42], in the form of “yuan/kW/month” [43]. Users will pay more as the signing demand increases. They are ﬁned if actual consumption exceeds the signed limit. The used tariff is generally calculated according to the actual consumption of the users. This pricing strategy can enhance the utilization of the equipment on the user side, hence improving the power grid load rate.

Incentive-based programs are essentially call option approaches in which users sell the right, but not the obligation, for the utility to reduce some of the customer's load in exchange for an up-front payment or a per kWh discount [44]. Interruptible tariffs have been introduced in some regions. For example, Jiangsu province initiated the strategy and paid 10000 yuan for per MWh curtailment in 2002 [45]. Hebei province put forward an interruptible tariff incentive of 1yuan/kWh in 2003. Similar strategies were also tested in Shanghai, Fujian and Zhejiang [46]. The subsidy is normally around 0.3e2 yuan/kWh [41]. Approximately 99e185 MW interruptible loads were shifted on three peak days during summer 2005 in Shanghai [41].

Policy-guided programs are speciﬁc types of DR under the current Chinese power system. The most severe electricity shortages in 2003 resulted in nationwide power rationing among the 18 provinces. Since then, DSM has strengthened to ensure orderly power utilization [47]. Local governments impose direct load controls through power monitoring systems on some customers who are supposed to quickly respond to the orders and curtail their loads. Based on the deﬁnition of the program, it is actually a special type of incentive-based program in which observant customers gain without being penalized or with the power restriction loosened.

Except for the policy-guided program, the categories of DR programs in China are similar to those in U.S [7] and some European countries [6]. But there exists large distinctions, in essence, in these programs. The electricity industry restructuring took place in 1990s U.S., which aimed at facilitating the development of regional, competitive wholesale electricity markets. However it gave rise to the imbalance between the supply and demand. Eventually, different types of DR programs became the solutions [48,49]. Three biggest power ﬁrm, located in eastern U.S. electricity markets, introduced there distinct incentive-based DR programs respectively, such as Day-Ahead Load Response, Emergency DR Program, and Special Case Resource program [6]. The DR customers include the industrial, commercial and residential sector. The most important feature in U.S. DR lies in that it has formed a competitive power market and become a mature industry. Likewise, in Great Britain, a relatively free power market was developed and DR has been implemented for several years [6]. In the industrial and large commercial sectors, energy intensive users are able to agree TOU and/or interruptible contracts with suppliers. And in some other European countries like Sweden and Finland, interruptible tariff programs were employed through legislation to control the power consumption in large industrial end-users.

Though going through the power system reform, China's power market is still under the status of monopoly. The DR programs are far less mature than those in U.S. and some European countries. The current features of DR programs in China can be summarized in the following bullet points:

  The government function and relevant policies are still the dictating factors on the DR programs.

  The existing DR programs, even the price-based programs and

incentive-based programs are set based on the policies.   The DR customers are mostly industrial users.

Among the current DR programs, TOU tariffs, interruptible tariffs, two-part pricing and orderly use schemes are mainly aimed at industrial users. However, with power consumption increasing in tertiary industry, commercial and residential buildings in China will gradually become important targets of DR in the future. As power marketing reform advances, the electric power sales market will be opened, and the current policy-guided programs require a corresponding transition. Therefore, establishing innovative and effective mechanisms in the context of power system reform is required to move forward.

3.2. DR-related policies in China

In the early 1990s, DSM was ﬁrst introduced in China. The DSM Directive Center was established by the State Power Corporation in 1998, resulting in publicity regarding the concept as well as theoretical DSM research. From 1996 to 2000, demonstration projects were successively launched in different provinces. Initial emphasis was placed on the energy saving in the early stages. The power failures in 22 provinces in 2003 resulted in the formation of a new pricing mechanism, which used price to create a dynamic supply and demand balance for electricity [33]. In the meantime, DR research began to obtain increasing attention. As an integral part of

DSM, DR-related policies are mainly covered by DSM policies. In this section, the DR-relevant parts are extracted and summarized, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

In 2004, NDRC and the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) issued the “Guidance on the reinforcing DSM”. In addition to energy efﬁciency, it proposed several measures for peak load management, such as load shifting, power storage, orderly power utilization and limitation, etc. [50]. In 2010, the NDRC, MOC and six other ministries jointly published the “Regulations on the DSM”, which involved DR-relevant provisions to improve the TOU pricing system, promoting energy storage during off-peak periods and implementing interruptible tariffs in some regions. The regulation also included incentives to develop DSM [51]. However, overall, the development of DSM in China still focuses on energy saving efforts, and DR has only been initiated and developed in certain regions in China.

DSM efforts have focused on the industrial ﬁeld because the industrial sector has been the largest electricity consumer, accounting for more than 70% of China's total electricity consumption. In 2011, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced the “Guidance on the better implementation of DSM in the industrial sector” [52]. Note that orderly power utilization strategies also concentrated on the industrial ﬁeld around this time.

On July 16, 2012, China's Ministry of Finance (MOC) and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) jointly issued “Interim Measures for management of central government funding for cities piloting DSM” [8]. The measures explicitly stated that DSM funding must be used to support efﬁciency power plant programs (EPP) and develop DR. This approach also determined speciﬁc criteria for incentives. On April 9, 2015, the NDRC together with MOC issued the “Announcement concerning the improvement of the power emergency mechanism and the trial work on DSM in pilot cities” [12]. Strengthening the mechanism of innovation and practicing DR were again stressed in this announcement.

Based on the DSM policies listed above, it can be concluded that DR has not aroused widespread concern until recently in China. The policies issued before 2011 merely mention provisions related to DR, while the provisions after 2012, in addition to becoming more common, more explicitly and carefully list terms and wording associated with DR. As reiterated in the latest 2015 DR policy, research and development of a DR mechanism under China's current power system is a top priority.

3.3. Driving and restraining forces of DR in China

In this section, driving forces and restraining forces associated with DR are summarized. As stated above, the domestic power system is the foundation for the development of DR, and DRrelevant policies should further inﬂuence the development process. Therefore, the major impetus for DR development is the need for structural reform of the power industry and implementation of DR related policies.

First, the reform of China's power industry, which has consistently grown over the past few decades (see Section 2.2), is the driver of DR development. Many efforts have been made to implement DR programs, especially those that reform electricitypricing mechanisms. If the domestic power system is reformed, a new power market competition pattern will form, providing a solid foundation for long-term DR development.

Second, increasingly more policies have supported DR implementation because the government plays an important and guiding role in China's power market. This is supported by the fact that DR pilot programs have been successively initiated by the Chinese government in different regions (see Section 3.2). In addition, DR encompasses a larger portion of DSM-relevant policies, and the provisions are becoming increasingly speciﬁc.

However, we note that China's power industry requires further reform. To solve many issues and promote efﬁcient, reliable and sustainable development of China's power industry by fulﬁlling the potential of DR, many challenges must still be addressed. The challenges include poor recognition of DSM and DR, cost and technological issues, the shortage of monitoring and management systems, the vagueness of an open power market, the weaknesses of laws and policies, etc. [8,14]. Based on reviews of the status quo of China's power industry in Section 2.1, power system reform in Section 2.2 and the current DR-related policies in Section 3.2, two main challenges are speciﬁcally highlighted.

One challenge stems from the existing problems in the Chinese power system. Currently, the power market is partly open only to the generation side and oligarchic competitive market, which is characterized by incomplete information. Without open markets and vigorous competition, DR will not easily develop in China [9]. As stated in Section 2.2, the State Grid Corp., China's monopolized power distributor, adopted a benchmark price strategy rather than a bidding transaction strategy and formed a bilateral monopoly on both sides of purchases and sales. In this dispatch mode, the powergeneration ﬁrms tend to build more generators to handle the everincreasing peak load without worrying about power sales. Thus, the potential of the DR is neglected. Therefore, efforts should be made to destroy the monopoly by challenging traditional mechanisms and conﬁguring power resources through an electric power market. Only in this way can DR manifest its value.

Another constraint is based on the lack of feasible DR mechanisms under the current power system. Because the reform of the China power system is a long-term process, a development strategy that is suitable for the current transition period is desperately needed. The announcement issued in 2015 [12] emphasized strengthening institutional-based and mechanism-based innovation related to DR research. Therefore, in this transition period,

determining proper mechanisms related to DR is another unprecedented challenge facing China.

It can be seen that increasing policies which favor DR are being formulated in China and the China's power market becomes gradually open and competitive from being monopolistic, both of which creates the advantageous condition for the development of DR in China. Nevertheless, the monopolistic feature of China's power market is inveterate enough to be able to emulate and follow the empirical experience in the leading countries, which to some extent decelerates the development of DR in China. The near future of DR in China might have the following features:

  The mainstream DR programs are still policy-intervened.

  The development of TOU and interruptible tariffs is contingent

on the issue of the relevant policies.

  The subsidized orderly power utilization will become an indis-

pensable DR program.

  The customers will be granted more rights and freedom.

In the following section, we provide six potentially feasible strategies, which incorporates the aforementioned features of DR in the near future.

4. Feasible DR schemes under the current situation

The case study presented in Section 2.2.3 demonstrates that DR can bring beneﬁts to all stakeholders, particularly end-use customers. Power utilities can improve traditional dispatch mechanisms by practicing DR from the demand side. However, the implementation of DR in China must adapt to trends associated with Chinese power system reform. In this section, strategies for applying DR to the current power system are proposed. 4.1. Adoption of cap-and-trade schemes

The contracted quota is the maximum power load for which the institutional customers sign contracts with the power utility in a payment cycle. If the actual consumption exceeds the limit, the cost would considerably increase. Additionally, if consumption failed to reach the quota, the customer still needs to pay the signed cost, and the surplus power could not be sold. Although the quota can effectively control the maximum load of the users at different times, enhancing the equipment efﬁciency on the user side and improving the load rate of the power network, however, for the users, the contracted quota is not associated with any tangible beneﬁts.

For a regional power network, the peak load of the entire user group should be controlled rather than that of a single customer [53]. With increasing power system reform, pricing tariffs should also change to beneﬁt users. Therefore, a power cap and trade system is suggested, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The single customer still signs contract quota with the power utility, but the customers in the same regional network can make trades on their surplus power. Trading users can sell or purchase power loads according to their own situations. If a portion of a quota is sold, the users cannot consume more than the new quota limit or they will be ﬁned. Likewise, the new quota is added to the capacity of the users who purchased it during a given payment cycle. In some cases, power utilities can also purchase capacities from users during emergency power shortages. In this scheme, the total load limit of a user group can be controlled, and the single user can gain proﬁts through the transaction, which is more ﬂexible.

The contracted quota has been implemented in China for years, which is an effective means to control the maximum load. The cap-and-trade scheme, which are designed on this basis, does not require any new equipment but a trading platform, thus not having technical problems. Since the quota transaction between customers makes the mechanism more ﬂexible, the probability of the ﬁning for excessing the quota is lowered and the power utility may have less revenue from the ﬁning. However, the power utility can buy back some quota to ensure the balance during the power tension, which will avoid the economic losses brought by the power deﬁcit. Therefore, the cap-and-trade scheme still guarantee the proﬁt of the power utility. It is a pilot scheme and worth developing.

4.2. Encouragement of the curtailment service providers (CSP)

Curtailment service providers (CSPs) who act as intermediaries between the power utilities and end-use customers to deliver the DR capacity, are popular in the US and Europe but are only currently emerging in China.

In 2008, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China (MOHURD) issued a new policy and offered subsidies

promoting sub-metering [54]. Subsequently, thousands of large commercial buildings in China have installed sub-metering systems. The sub-metering platforms are now mainly utilized for energy monitoring, building performance assessment and building energy efﬁciency analysis [55], [56]. The sub-metering systems effectively meet the metering and telemetry access requirements of CSPs to customers' meter data. CSPs will likely establish a signiﬁcant foothold in China and thus expand the DR industry based on the current sub-metering platforms. CSPs will also attract more new customers who will enroll and participate in DR programs.

The establishment of sub-metering platforms is one of the distinctive features in China's energy monitoring and management and the platform owners offer energy management service for end-users. Therefore, the DR Service can be a new service in the power management and the platform users provide a large proportion of customers for implementing DR. In Section 5.1, more detail will be provided regarding the sub-metering platform owners served as CSPs in Shanghai pilot. The CSPs based on the sub-metering platform can have a solid customer basis and it is a feasible means which went through the pilot experiment.

4.3. Development and extension of price-based programs

TOU tariffs are widely used for power load adjustments, which are becoming more stable and developed in China. Therefore, TOU tariffs should be maintained and expanded in ways that are more diverse and detailed. For instance, “TOU tariffs on special days” are suggested. This strategy is based on one-week or even one-day weather forecasts to determine the price difference between peaks and valleys, accounting for weather factors in different seasons. Additionally, critical peak pricing and two-part pricing are also effective measures for load control [57]. However, critical peak pricing is currently employed in limited regions in China [41].

The issue of DR policies in recent years facilitates the development of TOU. Various types of TOU could mitigate the imbalance brought by the consecutive high temperature, the repair and maintenance of the equipment and so forth. However, as stated in Section 2.2.2, the power price mechanism is determined by the State Grid, and hence the state or local government policies impose a tremendous impact on the development of TOU. The policyguided TOU cannot fully reﬂect the market supply and demand conditions. Thus, the effects of TOU in China on mitigating the imbalance are weakened.

4.4. Improvement of orderly power limitation

Orderly power limitation, as a compulsory policy-based DR program, is a traditional enforcement strategy that mainly controls the peak load of industrial customers in China. Since it does not offer subsidy for the users, it is hard to trigger their initiative and has been gradually challenged by different types of customers. However, it is still the foundation of the emergency DR and continues to play an important role in DR programs at this stage. Hence, some subsidized policies that motivate customers should be added to the DR strategy. For example, in the Shanghai DR pilot, 2 yuan/kWh curtailment subsidy is set to award the DR participants during peak periods. There exists other subsidies such as 100 yuan/ kW curtailment in other pilot cities [10]. However, these kinds of subsidies are targeted in the DR experiments in pilot cities. In the process of orderly power limitation, there does not exist such kind of subsidy. So the current feasible subsidized scheme is to follow the relevant policies in China, meanwhile adding some subsidizes in the orderly power limitation, which will enhance the users' initiative.

4.5. Implementation of subsidized DR programs Similar to the subsidy to the orderly power limitation, other DR programs can lure more customers through offering subsidies at the beginning. Subsidized DR programs represent a transition from policy-guided programs to incentive-based programs. For a long time, Chinese governments set up specialized funds for energy efﬁciency [58] and peak shaving [59]. These funds can also be utilized for DR incentives. On one hand, the “national mandate” of the policies ensures a curtailed power load. On the other hand, some subsidies or incentives will lure more customers to participate in DR strategies. By increasing the number of DR participants, the compelling features of these policies will be weakened, and complete incentive-based programs will likely form. Therefore, subsidized DR programs are more suitable for the current status. The subsidized form can follow the 100 yuan/kW curtailment in pilot cities [10], but it needs to be tuned based on the different types of the programs in the future.

4.6. Implementation of DR star ratings Considerable progress has been achieved via energy conservation and emissions reduction. This progress can be largely attributed to the target responsibility system and the assessment system (Star Ratings of the green commercial buildings) in China, which has aroused the widespread attention of the architecture practitioners on the building energy efﬁciency and built environment [60,61]. DR strategies can also mimic and learn from this mode, rating and assessing the customers' performances according to their curtailed power loads at peak times to promote and motivate users to participate in DR. It is hereby noted that DR Star Ratings are merely supporting measures for developing DR in China."
18,"Electricity demand response in China: Status, feasible market schemes and pilots","Demand Response (DR) has been extensively developed and implemented in the US and Europe. However, DR hardly exists in many developing countries for similar problems such as rigid power market and state monopoly. With the increasing imbalance between supply and demand in China's power industry, the government has issued new policies on DR and approved the first batch of pilot cities. China is setting a good example of how to encourage DR under monopolistic electric market and open up the market to aggregators and DR suppliers. This paper summarizes the current DR status, feasible DR market schemes and DR pilot projects in China. First, electric power system reform, renewable energy policies and power industry development are reviewed, highlighting the problems associated with the current dispatch mechanisms of DR policies and markets. New DR programs and DR-related policies are also introduced. On this basis, the driving forces and challenges associated with DR in China are analyzed. The major challenge is the lack of a suitable market mechanism for the current Chinese power industry. Hence, this paper presents six feasible strategies that fully utilize the existing policies. Additionally, the latest DR applications in different pilot cities are summarized and analyzed.","5. DR pilot projects in China

Shanghai, Foshan, Beijing, Suzhou and Tangshan are ﬁve cities that have implemented short DR programs in China [62]. These city pilots are different from previous TOU tariff, orderly power use and energy efﬁciency programs from a demand side perspective. Several trials have been conducted associated with the programs, such as the formulation of incentive policies, DR platform establishment, customer development, curtailment, end-user feedback, etc. The authors investigated and participated in the DR programs in Shanghai and Foshan. In this section, empirical evidence and outcomes are detailed in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2. A brief summary of DR city pilots in other cities is presented in Section 5.3.

5.1. Shanghai pilot

5.1.1. Introduction The peak and valley power loads in 2013 were 28 GW and

16.6 GW, respectively, and only 60 h exceeded 25 GW. The weather in summer 2014 was cooler, but the difference between the peak and valley loads was still large. The peak and valley power loads in 2014 were 26.9 GW and 8 GW, respectively, and only 90 h exceeded 90% of the peak load. The composition of the power supply in Shanghai included 15 GW generated from local power plants and 10e15 GW from purchasing. Thus, almost all the local plant generation was used during the peak times. If units malfunction, power shortages will occur.

Based on the development tendency of DR and the practical situation in Shanghai, the NDRC and State Grid utility gave the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization (SMCEI) the assignment of piloting the DR strategies of local enterprises and in commercial buildings during continuous high temperature days or power shortages.

The framework of the DR pilot is shown in Fig. 9. The DR center serves as the medium that receives and distributes DR quotas, releasing DR tasks to the load aggregators or industrial customers. The load aggregators are the load serving entities that gather customers to participate in the pilot, subscribe to the curtailment tasks from the DR center and distribute loads to the customers. In the Shanghai pilot, the load aggregators are actually the operators of the district-level sub-metering platforms, which are used to send notiﬁcations, monitor the response actions and evaluate the effect of DR.

Metering and telemetry conditions provide a good foundation for implementation of the DR pilot in Shanghai. Real-time communication between the power grid and the majority of users has been essentially achieved. Furthermore, 600 blocks of large commercial buildings have established sub-metering platforms, providing favorable conditions for load aggregators to develop strategies and supervise the curtailments of commercial buildings.

The total power consumption in buildings are submeterred into four categories in China: lighting and plug, air-conditioning, power and special submeters. Data on these submeters are normally collected every 15 min. The major power consuming equipment is also gauged, such as the chiller, the chilled and cooling water pump, the elevators, and so forth. The commercial buildings taking part in the Shanghai DR pilot all have such sub-metering platform, with the function of data collecting and uploading. The higher level platform (district level, city level) can collect and storage real-time power consumption. In addition, the sub-metering platform undertook the important tasks of analyzing the history power consumption of users, deciding the DR strategies of users and the power monitoring of users during the DR period.

5.1.2. Results Sixty-four end-use customers participated in the Shanghai DR pilot (31 industrial enterprises and 33 commercial buildings). Among them, 31 industrial customers were original users participating in orderly power limitation, who were experienced in the peak load control. Compared to the original program, the pilot DR experiment could own them 2 yuan per kWh curtailment subsidy, so they acted positively towards the pilot. The other 33 commercial customers were mostly customers from the submetering platform, who paid more attention to the energy management than common building owners. The total estimated DR capacity was more than 100 MW. The trials were conducted 13:30e15:30 on July 22, 2014 and 13:00e16:00 on August 29, 2014. There were not preset compulsory curtailing target in these two trials and the customers could limit their own power loads according to their conditions. The realized DR capacity was approximately 50 MW in the second experiment. As new participants in Chinese DR-based strategies, commercial buildings reduced their peak loads by 10% during the two trials, validating the feasibility of DR in commercial buildings. The results of the experiments are detailed in Table 4.

In the second trial, three of seven participating industrial companies had a substantial effect on the DR and met the requirement of the subscribed curtailable volume. The corresponding strategies used to reduce loads included shutting down electric boilers in advance, turning off workshop AC units and employing backup renewable generators. However, the other four industrial companies failed to accomplish these tasks due to production plans.

In general, the Shanghai pilot established a groundbreaking DR platform and a model that can be replicated in other regions, promoting a nationwide DR strategy. The value of the Shanghai pilot is summarized as follows:

, It validated the feasibility and value of commercial submetering platforms and industrial energy management systems based on DR. , A DR trial was successfully conducted and valuable feedback was collected from end users. For example, discontinuous industrial production has signiﬁcant DR potential, and large commercial buildings exhibited 10e15% load shaving capacities. , This pilot helped to establish the user baseline load. By comparing the methodology used to calculate the customer baseline load in the US and considering the features of the Shanghai power market, weather conditions, etc., an approach

Table 4 Experimental results from the commercial buildings in the Shanghai pilot.

for calculating the customer baseline load in Shanghai DR is presented. The detailed method is explained in Table 5.

Here, N DRi represents the average power load during the response period on the ith day. N 2hbDRi is the average power load two hours before the response period on the ith day.

Because the Shanghai DR pilot is new and tentative in China, there are still some issues with the strategy. These problems can also be summarized as follows:

, A discrepancy exists between the DR center data and the customer self-metering data. The end-use customers cannot accurately monitor their own load conditions because the center does not provide them with real-time data. , The amounts and types of incentives are insufﬁcient. Only 2 yuan per kWh are paid for load shifting, which is not enough to motivate different types of end-use customers to take part in the DR strategy. , The pilot lacked publicity and promotional efforts, resulting in parties poorly understanding the DR strategy as a resource for power balance and generation competition.

5.2. Foshan pilot

5.2.1. Introduction As one of the ﬁrst DSM pilot cities, Foshan committed to DSM from 2013 to 2015 in an attempt to save and shift its 450 MW peak power load. In July 2013, the maximum power load reached

10.5 GW, surpassing 10 GW for the ﬁrst time. In 2014, the total supply of the local utility was 0.556 million GWh and the investment in grid construction was as high as 22.83 billion yuan.

In this context, the NRDC implemented a DR strategy, stipulating that at least 60 MW of the power load be shifted using DR, and the subsidy was 130 yuan per kW. Similar to the Shanghai DR platform, the Foshan DR pilot also uses a city-level DR management platform to publish information and collect feedback based on the load management system of the local power supply bureau. Fig. 10 illustrates the framework of the Foshan DR pilot. The end-use customers are composed of load aggregators and industrial enterprises that voluntarily sign DR contracts with the city government. Foshan Power Supply Bureau forecasts the next-day peak load in advance, releases the load shaving based on the DR management platform and distributes DR tasks to the load aggregators and industrial companies. The participants monitor the DR process and make corresponding adjustments to their strategies through the platform.

5.2.2. Results The standard of temporal subsidy for DR pilot in Foshan was 130 yuan/kW. Eight DR events were conducted in Foshan in 2015, among which the fewest participants was 29. As many as 100 customers participated in the October 22nd DR pilot. Regarding the DR completion rate deﬁned in Eq. (1), the lowest was 71% (the fourth pilot) and the highest reached 166% (the ﬁfth pilot). The detailed completion status is depicted in Fig. 11. The predictions of customers' curtailment loads are quite accurate. Customers were very cooperative during these eight DR events.

CR is the completion rate of the DR events and V actual is the actual reduced load (kW).

The results of this DR pilot program support the feasibility and validity of the DR framework in Foshan based on the customers' reactions to the DR. The DR platform exhibits strengths associated with dispatching and coordination. The load management system and sub-metering system are also used during the experimental period.

The Foshan DR pilot program was conducted after the Shanghai pilot and avoided some of the problems encountered in Shanghai. However, the participants in the Foshan pilot program were mostly industrial companies; hence, the results obtained from this pilot unavoidably encompass inherent one-sidedness. Because the power use patterns in commercial and residential buildings are different and the corresponding stakeholders have different concerns, effectively promoting the initiative to commercial and residential end-users is crucial for the development of DR in Foshan.

5.3. Pilot projects in other regions

In addition to Shanghai and Foshan, DR pilot programs were also implemented in other cities in China. In this section, these pilots are brieﬂy introduced and summarized.

5.3.1. Beijing pilot The peak power load in Beijing in 2012 reached 17.2 GW, and the deﬁcit was approximately 7.42 GW. On July 13, 2015, the largest load reached 18.16 GW, topping the 2013 record of 17.76 GW. The power load associated with AC accounted for nearly 40% of the peak load. As a city piloting DSM, the ﬁrst DR trial was conducted in 2015. Unlike the pilots in Shanghai and Foshan, customer development was based on policy guidance. The participants of the programs were evaluated by experts after submitting applications. Because DR events are new in China, promotion and publicity to attract more customers was the top priority. Establishing such a policy threshold will inﬂuence the active participation of the customers and negatively affect long-term DR development. The DR incentives were divided into three categories according to the duration: 80 yuan/kW for 24 h, 100 yuan/kW for 4 h, 12 yuan/kW for 0.5 h. Between 11:00e12:00 a.m. on August 12, 2015, a short-term DR experiment was performed across the entire city. Seventeen load aggregators and 74 end-users participated in this trial [63]. The outcome of the experiment is shown in Fig. 12 based on different types of customers. Compared to industrial enterprises, commercial and residential buildings exhibited a relatively modestly reduced peak loads, especially residential customers. This is because previous DSM projects such as orderly power limitation programs mainly focus on industrial companies. Having added incentives, these programs seem to be more appealing to industrial customers. In addition, the policy threshold and the simple incentive measures do not motivate commercial and residential customers to participate in the initiative. 5.3.2. Suzhou pilot The power imbalance of supply and demand aggravates in Suzhou during the peak time annually. The total power consumption in 2012 was 1.189 million GWh, and the peak power load was

18.2 GW. The power deﬁcit reached 2.06 GW. In August 2015, the maximum load topped 22.18 GW, reaching an all-time high. To relieve the power strain during peak times, the “Notice on promoting and accelerating the DR work and power optimized utilization” [64] was issued in April 2015, offering a policy guarantee associated with implementing DR. The notice requires customers to reduce power consumption by at least 10% during peak times (10:00e11:00/13:30e15:30/20:00e21:00) every day, and each kW curtailment is eligible to receive a subsidy of 110 yuan. The DR experiments were implemented in Suzhou twice in 2015, and the detailed information was tabulated in Table 6.

5.3.3. Tangshan pilot As the ﬁrst batches of pilot cities for DSM, Tangshan has not implemented DR yet. Differing from Shanghai and Beijing, secondary industries are dominant in Tangshan. Steel and building material companies are particularly capable of shifting loads. The peak load rate in Tangshan is high, and the peak-valley difference has been partially alleviated by TOU tariffs. However, the maximum power load in Tangshan reached a record of 11.1 GW in 2014 [65]. Relying on only industrial enterprises to shift loads cannot ease the peak demand. Hence, DR from commercial and residential customers are also required.

The pilot experiment has not yet been conducted. However, the energy management platform has been established monitor power consumption in real time. The total transformer capacity reached 582555 kV A and the end-use side monitoring power was 464528 kW. Four additional monitoring stations are being constructed, providing a foundation for the implementation of DR in the commercial and residential customers [66]. 6. Conclusions

Due to a booming economy and rapid development in China, electricity demands are also increasing rapidly, reaching a new record high in summer 2015. Renewable energy policies have been established to promote the development of renewable energy generation. However, due to intermittency, it is currently difﬁcult to achieve large-scale power grid integration and sales. DR, an effective approach to balancing power supply and demand, can largely mitigate these two problems. An emphasis was once placed on energy conservation despite the early implementation of DSM in China. However, DR has become a relatively independent concept in recent years and has been given widespread attention.

This paper speciﬁcally focuses on the DR associated with Chinese DSM. Power industry development and power system reform are detailed in this paper. The current status of DR and the experiences and outcomes of DR pilot projects are also presented. The major conclusions are as follows: , Despite the implementation of power system reform over many years, the State Grid Corp. still monopolizes the power market as a single buyer on the generation side and a single seller on the end-use customer side. , DR development in China faces two pressing issues: 1) People are not aware of the beneﬁts associated with DR, and the common practice for mitigating the peak load over a long period involves building more generators and power plants. 2) The appropriate DR market schemes are still lacking during this transitional phase of the electric industry. , From a case study of beneﬁt evaluation, DR can yield substantial beneﬁts for all parties, including the power plants, the State Grid and the end-use customers, while simultaneously alleviating power strains. , Six appropriate DR market schemes are proposed in this paper during this transitional phase: 1) adoption of cap-and-trade schemes; 2) encouragement of curtailment service providers (CSP); 3) development and extension of price-based programs; 4) improvement of orderly power limitation; 5) implementation of subsidized DR programs; and 6) implementation of DR star ratings. , DR city pilot projects have been implemented in ﬁve pilot cities, illustrating the signiﬁcant progress of DR development in China. However, problems still remain with the DR strategy: 1) customer development is not sufﬁcient, and the incentives are unitary in the Shanghai and Foshan pilots; 2) the policy threshold in Beijing affects the engagement of commercial and residential buildings; and 3) except for the Shanghai pilot, the pilot projects are more beneﬁcial to industrial enterprises.

In general, the implementation of DR is an effective approach for dealing with problems in the current power market in China. Additionally, the Chinese government and all parts of society are beginning to pay attention to the DR strategy. Although it is still in its primary stage, DR can potentially be developed and expanded with the support of relevant policies and experiences from the city pilots. And China is setting a good example of how to encourage DR under tightly government controlled electric market and how to open up the demand market to aggregators and DR suppliers.

19,Forty years of irrigation development and reform in China,"This study reviews 40 years of irrigation development in China including the transformation of the institutional and incentive structures in irrigation management. After rural reforms in the 1970s, irrigation investments slowed until the late 1990s. In North China, farmers became major investors in groundwater irrigation, leading to property rights’ transfer of tube wells from collective to private ownership. Despite positive effects in cropping patterns, farmer income and development of groundwater markets, privatisation has accelerated groundwater table deterioration. Since the middle of 1990s, Water User Associations have replaced village collective management of surface irrigation. This approach was adopted by most provinces by early 2001 with mixed results; only institutions with water-saving incentives realised efficient irrigation. The Government is reforming water price policies to provide water-saving incentives to farmers while not hurting their income. While China has focused on water rights and markets, and despite regulations and pilot projects, full implementation of water rights has been slow. Research reveals greater policy scope for expanding irrigation technologies that generate real water saving to rural areas. Given pressure associated with water scarcity and concern for food security, further effective reforms in irrigation and policy incentives are expected. The Government has also initiated some pilot projects to resolve increasing water scarcity problems through adjusting agricultural production activities.","1. Introduction
Since the onset of the economic reforms and the implementation of the household responsibility system (HRS) in the late 1970s, China’s rural economy has achieved impressive growth. From 1978 to 2017, grain production increased from 305 to 662 million tons, with an annual growth rate of 2.0 per cent (NBSC 2018). The value of agricultural products in real terms has grown at an even faster rate of by 5.4 per cent per year. Investment in irrigation is among the major factors that have contributed to the success of the economic reform in boosting rural growth (Huang and Rozelle 2018). By increasing crop yields as well as allowing more growing seasons, irrigation can double agricultural productivity relative to rainfed land (Wang et al. 2010). Although the amount of irrigation investment has fluctuated over the years, effective irrigated land that is equipped with irrigation facilities has increased significantly. By 2017, China’s irrigated land has reached 67,816,000 ha, covering half of all cultivated land (NBSC 2018). Over 70 per cent of China’s grain, 80 per cent of the nation’s cotton and more than 90 per cent of the nation’s vegetables are grown on irrigated land (Wang et al. 2017). However, increasing water scarcity has threatened the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. China’s per capita water availability is only one-fourth of the global average (Wang et al. 2017). Moreover, water resource are not evenly distributed. With just 19 per cent of water endowment, Northern China supports more than 65 per cent of the national cultivated land and 50 per cent of grain production (NBSC 2018). From 1961 to 2011, river run-off in 60 per cent of large river basins has seen a decline, primarily in Northern China.1 As surface water resource decrease, water users (particularly farmers) are turning to groundwater resource (Wang et al. 2006). Due to dry climatic conditions and high variability of precipitation, groundwater also acts as an important storage buffer in Northern China. However, the reliance on groundwater leads to overdraft and adverse environmental effects (Wang et al. 2017). Furthermore, water users in the agricultural sector are displaced by users in other sectors. From 1978 to 2017, the share of agricultural water use declined from 88 per cent to 62 per cent due to increasing industrial and domestic water use. In the most recent decade, the Government has started to recognise the importance of meeting ecological water requirements, which increases the demand for water. In future, climate change is expected to further aggravate the gap between the supply and demand of water, and enhance the supply variability (Wang et al. 2013; IPCC 2014).
Since food self-sufficiency has always been an important policy goal and irrigation is one of the key factors to maintain food security, China’s Government has been active in pursuing solutions to the challenges of irrigated agriculture. Traditionally, the Government has focused on the supply side and relied on projects that augmented water supply such as building reservoirs to meet the growing water demand (Xie et al. 2009; Wang 2012). Over time, it has become clear that it is difficult to catch up with the expanding water demand and the demand side also needs to be managed. The Government started to advocate irrigation technologies to reduce irrigation withdrawal since the early 1990s (Lohmar et al. 2003). The government encouraged reforms of institutional arrangements in water management and provided economic incentives to save water (Huang et al. 2010b). The Government also experimented with market-based solutions such as the assignment and trading of water rights and developing water markets to improve allocative efficiency of water use (Speed 2009; Moore 2015). Irrigation pricing policy has always been on the policy agenda (Huang et al. 2010a). In recent years, the Government has renewed its efforts to reform irrigation water price (Sun et al. 2018).
The overall goal of this study is to review irrigation development in China and examine the trends, drivers, and effects of the 40-year transformation of the institutional arrangement and incentive mechanisms in irrigation man- agement. No prior literature has reviewed Chinese irrigation over this period. In the last 2 years, China launched the multidimensional Rural Revitalization Development Strategy (Huang and Rozelle 2018). This strategy aims to absorb lessons from past development and policymaking to inform future development. There are significant policy implications and urgent policy requirement of reviewing 40 years of irrigation development and manage- ment; this is expected to support rural revitalisation. The fruits of this examination could also be useful to other countries facing water scarcity. The study focuses on North China since it is one of the most water-scarce areas in the world. A unique aspect of this study is that most information used comes from village and household survey data the authors have collected in rural China over more than two decades.
To this effect, we pursued the following objectives. First, we tracked the evolution of irrigation investment and development of irrigated areas over the past 40 years, and to understand the relevant policies. Second, we examined the trends in the institutional arrangement of groundwater and surface irrigation reforms, and then identified their effect on water use, agricultural production, and farmer income. Third, we analysed the trends, drivers and effects of reform in incentive mechanisms, including irrigation price policy, establishment of a water rights system, and development of water markets. Fourth, we summarised the adoption trends, influence factors, and effects of water-saving technologies, followed by a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for future reforms in irrigation sector.
The remaining paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises irrigation development and investment over 40 years. Section 3 presents the trend, drivers, and effects of surface and groundwater irrigation systems. Then, we analysed the progress of reform in irrigation price policy, water rights system, and water markets in Section 4. Section 5 presents the adoption status, influence factors, and effects of water-saving technologies. Section 6 includes the challenges and opportunities for irrigation development, as well as future reforms in management. The final section deals with new policies on controlling groundwater overdraft and the progress and major challenges of pilot projects in Hebei Province, followed by the concluding remarks.
2. Irrigation development and investment in China
China has a long history of water capture and control, especially for flood control and irrigation (Calow et al. 2009). Before rural reforms, significant investments in water infrastructure helped China establish a robust rural irrigation system. At the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the new nation struggled with low agricultural productivity, natural disasters (such as drought and floods), and poor farmers. As a primarily rural economy, the Government considered water infrastructure to be an impor- tant investment priority. This turned to be a smart development strategy that influenced China’s long-term progress. From 1950 to 1978, China invested nearly 100 billion yuan into water infrastructure; this accounted for 6.9 per cent of the national total investment in infrastructure (MWR various years). Moreover, farmers also formed the labours force in the construction of this infrastructure (Lohmar et al. 2003). Thus, China’s effective irrigated land areas increased from 16,000,000 ha in 1950 to 48,050,000 ha in 1978, with an annual growth rate of 4.01 per cent (Figure 1 and Table 1). The share of cultivated land areas equipped with irrigation facilities increased from 16 per cent in 1950 to 48 per cent in 1978. That is, before rural reforms in China, near half of the cultivated land areas had access to irrigation water. However, after the rural reforms, the expansion of irrigated land areas slowed down and even showed a declining trend in the early 10-year reform period. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, de-collectivisation through rural reforms has increased agricultural productivity and production. From 1978 to 1984, the annual growth rate of grain productivity and output reached 6.12 per cent and 4.95 per cent, respectively (NBSC 2018). It is likely that this progress motivated Chinese policymakers to shift their investment focus from agriculture to industrial and other sectors (Lohmar et al. 2003). The Government not only reduced funding for developing new water infrastruc- ture by a considerable margin, but also neglected funding for the operation and maintenance of existing irrigation facilities. The percentage of construc- tion funds for water infrastructure over total infrastructure declined from 7.1 per cent in 1978 to a paltry 1.9 per cent in 1988. Correspondingly, irrigated land areas in this period decreased from 48,050,000 ha to 47,910,000 ha (Figure 1). Many irrigation facilities have also deteriorated or become dysfunctional because of low investments.
The decline in irrigated land areas and deterioration of the irrigation system negatively affected agricultural production. Post-reform grain pro- duction peaked in 1984; it then declined and stagnated in the late 1980s (NBSC 2018). From 1984 to 1988, grain production and productivity decreased by 3.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, with annual growth rates of 0.82 per cent and 0.02 per cent, lower than those in the early reform period. The decrease in grain productivity reflects the diminished contribution of de-collectivisation in certain degree. However, the decline in irrigated land areas and weakened capacity to adapt to natural disasters likely explains this decrease in grain production. Wen (1993) blamed low invest- ment in agriculture for this decline. Moreover, based on the estimation of the effect of irrigation investment on total factor productivity, Huang et al. (2000) found that China’s irrigation system was losing its ability to increase output and productivity. Eventually, waning irrigation investments and associated issues attracted the attention of policymakers; the decline was reversed, and the area of land irrigated has increased since the late 1980s. In 1988, China’s first Water Law was issued, and the decline in irrigated area is considered to be a primary reason for its passage (Lohmar et al. 2003). After 1988, Government investments in water infrastructure gradually increased to 2.9 per cent of total investments. This investment boom was partially triggered by the need to restore and maintain water infrastructure, but also by a renewed national commitment to all infrastructure investment. In 1990, irrigated land area rose to 48,390,000 ha, marginally higher than the level in 1978. In spite of this positive development, the annual growth rate of irrigated land areas from 1978 to 1990 was only 0.06 per cent; lower than the pre-reform rate (Table 1). In the 1990s, irrigated land areas continued to expand, but the annual growth rate was still a low 1.07 per cent.
From the late 1980s to most of the 1990s, water scarcity increased because of continuous expansion of irrigated areas and increasing water demands for industrial and domestic use. It was not until the late 1990s that the Chinese Government recognised this trend. In 1997, the lower reaches of the Yellow River (the second largest river in China) dried up for 226 days, which affected socio-economic activities in downstream river areas (Wang et al. 2009). During this period, the Government noted the disappearing prospects for tapping additional water resource for irrigation supply. Instead of further large-scale expansion of irrigated land areas, it became necessary to upgrade existing irrigation facilities and increase efficiency. Officials began to shift their investment priorities from new projects to renovations and maintenance of existing systems (Nyberg and Rozelle 1999). In the late 1990s, the Government launched massive programs to improve irrigation conditions and increase water-use efficiency. Two such programs included upgrading, renovating and investing in water-saving facilities of large-scale and middle- scale irrigation districts (IDs) and Agricultural Comprehensive Development. Consequently, irrigated land saw steady growth in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and the annual increase rate was 1.15 per cent, higher than that before 2000.
As China entered the second decade of this century, evidence indicated severe water scarcity has been increasing. This threatened China’s resource base, agricultural production, and sustainable development. Recognising such serious challenges, the Government committed itself to more irrigation investments and expansion of irrigated land areas. In 2011, Document No 1. of the Central Committee expressly dealt with accelerating reform and development of water infrastructure, with special attention given to improv- ing irrigation conditions. Consequently, under the central government’s aegis, irrigated land areas rose from 60,348,000 ha in 2010 to 67,816,000 ha in 2017 (50 per cent of cultivated land areas), with an annual increase rate of 3.36 per cent. This was the first post-reform period in which the annual increase rate came close to pre-reform levels (Figure 1). Our field survey provides strong evidence to indicate the remarkable increase in irrigation investments in recent years, especially by the Govern- ment. Based on our NCWRS data,2 in the 1990s, the annual growth rate of irrigation investment at the village level was 7.6 per cent; this number was 21.4 per cent in the first decade of the twenty-first century (Figure 2). However, from 2011 to 2016, the annual growth rate jumped to 34.2 per cent, higher than in other post-reform periods. We found that the percentage of government investments significantly increased after 2000. In the 1990s, 28 per cent percentage of irrigation in rural areas was under the central or local government. In the 2000s, this number increased to 49 per cent. After 2010, most rural irrigation investment was government-led; on average, it accounts for 74 per cent of total irrigation investment in Northern China.
3. Reform of institutional arrangement for managing irrigation
China has developed a vast and complex bureaucracy to manage its water resource. The primary state agency charged with managing the state’s water is the MWR and its provincial counterparts. In areas that use surface water for irrigation, IDs, and local Water Resource Bureaus often manage the upper levels of irrigation systems (the main canals and branch canals) that transfer water out of major rivers (e.g. the Yellow River) or reservoirs and channel it to lower levels. Local irrigation systems (tertiary canals and below) are administered by county, township governments, and village committees (Xie et al. 2009). The canal network in the village is the responsibility of the village. In areas that use groundwater, both wells and groundwater irrigation are managed within the village. Both the groundwater sector and the surface water sector have experienced changes in institutional arrangements in the past several decades. This section describes these changes and discusses their impacts.
3.1. Reform of institutional arrangement for managing groundwater irrigation
Since the 1950s, China’s irrigation investment was mainly targeted at exploiting surface water resource. The groundwater irrigation system only developed during the late sixties in Northern China. At this time, faced with increasing demand and limited surface water supply, farming communities in the region turned to groundwater; hence groundwater irrigated land areas rose to 30 per cent by 1970 (Figure 3; Wang et al. 2006). In addition, extensive surface irrigation has caused serious salinity issues in many IDs in Northern China. As a response, in the early 1970s, the Government began to financially support village collectives exploring groundwater. By 1980, groundwater irrigated areas had increased, with 55 per cent of irrigated land areas in Northern China extracting groundwater. Further, the number of agricultural wells increased from 0.2 million in 1965 to 2.3 million in 1980, while the amount of groundwater abstraction increased from almost zero to 75 bcum.
Unfortunately, the expansion of groundwater irrigation is not without cost. With increasingly intensive use of groundwater and insufficient recharge rate, the groundwater table began to decline in Northern China. The groundwater table first dropped in the 1970s, a problem that has become more serious since the 1980s (Wang et al. 2006). Excessive withdrawals and falling water tables have also caused land subsidence, cones of depression, and deterioration of water quality. Consequently, pumping costs have risen by 0.005 yuan per cubic metre. Because of poor pump and engine maintenance, agricultural tube wells in many regions have become unusable, requiring replacement with even deeper tube wells (Wang et al. 2007). The need for new investments to replace tube wells first arose in the early 1980s when de-collectivisation and the fiscal reforms left many villages without access to investment funds or command over labour to invest in tube wells (Lohmar et al. 2003).
Thus, rural farmers took over the responsibilities of investing and managing agricultural tube wells, leading to a profound transformation of the institutional arrangement of groundwater irrigation. With the implemen- tation of the HRS through rural reforms, farmers were allowed to independently manage land allocated to them and retain profits from agricultural production (Lin 1992). To earn higher profits, farmers would need to enhance agricultural productivity through reliable irrigation supply. To ease such issues, the Government relaxed constraints on individual investments. Therefore, responding to the growing number of inoperable tube wells and lack of collective investment and management, individual farmers began to drill tube wells. As a consequence, the property rights of tube wells dramatically shifted from collective to private ownership.
Since the early 1980s, individual farmers have become major investors of agricultural tube wells. After the mid-1990s, private ownership dominated tube well property rights. Our CWIM data reveal that farmers already made two-thirds of new investments in 1983, contributing 67 per cent of new tube well investments.3 Even so, in this period, collective tube wells still accounted for 93 per cent of total tube wells (Wang et al. 2007). Since the late 1980s, collective tube wells sharply declined owing to private tube well ownership. In 1995, the share of collective tube wells dropped to 47 per cent, while private tube wells rose to 63 per cent (Figure 4). In the mid-2000s, the share of collective tube wells diminished to 17 per cent, and private tube wells dominated, accounting for 83 per cent of total tube wells. Our survey of six provinces in Northern China also confirmed this trend; private tube wells rose from 42 per cent in 1995 to 67 per cent in 2016, of which 56 per cent fell under individual ownership (investment by individual household) and 11 per cent under shareholding ownership (joint investment by several households).
However, after the mid-2000s, tube well ownership trends reversed; the share of private tube wells declined, and collective ownership increased. Our CWIM data demonstrated that, in 2007, private tube wells dropped to 69 percent (compared with 83 per cent in 2004) (Figure 4). Although this share increased by 2011 (72 per cent), in 2016, the percentage further declined to 61 per cent. There are three likely reasons for this. First, the government increased investments in irrigation development in the past decade. Second, farmers’ investment incentives declined once farming income ceased to be a major source of income and farmers allocated more of their labour to non- agricultural activities. Third, pumping costs increased because of groundwa- ter table lowering, thereby exceeding farmers’ financial capability.
The privatisation of tube well ownership affected agricultural production and groundwater use. For instance, farmers expanded the sown area of less water-sensitive and high-value crops, such as maize, cotton, and non-cotton cash crops (mainly horticultural crops) (Wang et al. 2010). Their incomes increased from adjusting cropping patterns. Moreover, groundwater service markets have emerged transferring tube well services from tube well owners to non-owners (Zhang et al. 2008). Villages with active groundwater service markets increased from 5 per cent in 1990 to 80 per cent in NCP. Scholars found that farmers who buy water from local groundwater service markets use less water than farmers who have their own tube wells or use collective tube wells (Zhang et al. 2010).
Despite seemingly positive effects, there is a negative side to tube well privatisation. The empirical analysis showed that privatisation has acceler- ated groundwater table lowering (Wang et al. 2009). So, while a groundwater market improves water-use efficiency, it still cannot offset the negative effect of privatisation on the table. Therefore, farmers’ initiatives that modify the institutional arrangement of groundwater management cannot resolve water scarcity. In fact, it has aggravated the scarcity. To promote sustainable utilisation of groundwater resource, it is necessary for policymakers to address the falling groundwater table.
The issues was neglected for a long time, however the Government began addressing groundwater management in the mid-2000s. Before the twenty- first century, management was firstly short-staffed, fragmented, and it was difficult to find specific government regulations by the centre on dealing with groundwater problems. Even when local regulations existed, implementation was ineffective (Wang et al. 2010; 2019). However, from 2004, the MWR began to publish a bulletin on groundwater resource and issue national policies for managing groundwater (such as, regulations on water quota management and water resource fee). In 2014, China launched a pilot project on comprehensive control of groundwater overdraft issues in Hebei Province. The main goal of the project is to control the total amount of groundwater withdrawal in the region. The project also promotes using measures such as irrigation technologies, crop mix adjustment, and land fallow programs to cut down groundwater use. In 2018, the pilot projects were extended to other provinces including Shanxi and Shandong Provinces. Although it is too early to have a conclusive assessment of the effects of these pilot projects, it is clear that groundwater management has become a priority for policymakers in China.

19,Forty years of irrigation development and reform in China,"This study reviews 40 years of irrigation development in China including the transformation of the institutional and incentive structures in irrigation management. After rural reforms in the 1970s, irrigation investments slowed until the late 1990s. In North China, farmers became major investors in groundwater irrigation, leading to property rights’ transfer of tube wells from collective to private ownership. Despite positive effects in cropping patterns, farmer income and development of groundwater markets, privatisation has accelerated groundwater table deterioration. Since the middle of 1990s, Water User Associations have replaced village collective management of surface irrigation. This approach was adopted by most provinces by early 2001 with mixed results; only institutions with water-saving incentives realised efficient irrigation. The Government is reforming water price policies to provide water-saving incentives to farmers while not hurting their income. While China has focused on water rights and markets, and despite regulations and pilot projects, full implementation of water rights has been slow. Research reveals greater policy scope for expanding irrigation technologies that generate real water saving to rural areas. Given pressure associated with water scarcity and concern for food security, further effective reforms in irrigation and policy incentives are expected. The Government has also initiated some pilot projects to resolve increasing water scarcity problems through adjusting agricultural production activities.","3.2. Institutional arrangement for managing surface irrigation
Compared with the institutional innovation in groundwater irrigation in the early 1980s, similar reforms for surface irrigation developed later. Particu- larly, they were not promoted until the mid-1990s. Since the start of rural reform in the late 1970s, transfer of irrigation investment funds from the national to local governments fell significantly. The reform also led to ambiguous property rights over many local water delivery systems built in the collective period (1959 - 1979). The fiscal constraints and ambiguity over property rights produced weak incentives for local governments to invest in and maintain irrigation systems that deliver surface water resource. Thus, the irrigated land areas declined, and the facilities deteriorated in many IDs. While the central Government encouraged IDs to commercialise activities they could maintain themselves, the performance of the reforms was not satisfactory (Lohmar et al. 2003). During this period, deterioration of irrigation systems and increasing water supply challenges became a common problem in many developing and developed countries. To resolve these problems, some countries, such as Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, began to reform the institutional arrangement of irrigation by involving farmers into management, from the late 1980s onward.
In the mid-1990s, the World Bank began to promote irrigation manage- ment reform in its funded IDs of Hubei and Hunan Provinces. This initiated the reform of China’s surface irrigation institution. In the reform, manage- ment responsibilities were transferred from village collectives to Water User Associations (WUAs). In theory, a WUA is farmer-based, participatory organisation. Because of The World Bank project’s success, the Government began to promote the reform in other IDs by issuing regulations. For example, the central Government issued suggestions on reforming the management system of water infrastructure in 2002. This regulation encouraged the establishment of WUAs. Then, it issued two specific regulations guiding the effective development of WUAs in 2005 and 2014. Many local Governments (Water Resource Bureaus) helped establish WUAs. Surface irrigation management reforms rapidly expanded to many IDs. From 2001 to 2016, the number of WUAs increased from 1,000 to more than 80,000. Currently, WUAs provide irrigation services for 30 per cent of irrigated land areas covering all provinces in China (Li 2002; MWR 2016).
Though WUAs dominate institutional reforms in irrigation, they are not the only option that has been adopted by local governments. In practice, some village committees also established contracts with individual farmers to manage water issues in villages. For example, according to our field survey in Ningxia and Henan Provinces in the Yellow River Basin, before 2004, the percentage of villages establishing contracting management (30 per cent) was higher than those with WUAs (22 per cent) (Table 2). However, after 2004, the percentage of contracting management rapidly declined; in 2008, WUAs already became more dominant, covering 71.5 per cent of the villages. In 2016, WUAs provided irrigation services for 81.3 per cent of the villages, while this number was only 15.6 per cent for contracting management and 3.1 per cent for collective management.
Despite the efforts of policymakers and rapid development, not all institutional reforms have been implemented successfully. Wang et al. (2010) found that The World Bank-funded WUAs were successful because of large investments in irrigation facilities, building human capacity and strict regulations to guide their operation. However, visits to the field in rural China revealed cases in which local irrigation management changes had failed. For example, Wang et al. (2014; 2005; 2006) found that only institutions that established water-saving incentives were successful in reducing irrigation. In addition, the reduction of irrigation owing to an incentive mechanism declined from 40 per cent in the early 2000s to 20 percent in recent years (Wang et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2014). Importantly, the reduction of irrigation negatively affected wheat yield (Wang et al. 2014). Therefore, more WUA managers gave up the opportunity to establish incentive mechanisms. Though extensively covered in extant literature, Wang et al. (2006) found that the participation role of farmers in improving the performance of the irrigation institution was limited. Mixed performance of irrigation management reform also can be found in other countries in Asia (Mukherji et al. 2012).
Moreover, reform of the surface irrigation institution faces challenges of financial sustainability, besides other issues. As a farmers’ organisation, most WUAs do not have fixed sources to support operations and maintenance. In some regions, WUAs add extra fees to irrigation charges. However, considering farmers’ cooperation and participation, not all WUAs can opt for this method. Further, in some IDs, local Government provide financial subsidies for the operation of WUAs. Besides financial sustainability, effective operation of WUAs is also plagued by issues such as lack of capacity building for farmers, lack of appropriate legal backup, unreliable water supply, and nominally turning over responsibilities and power to irrigators. In spite of progress, the reform of surface irrigation institution is far from successful. It still requires formal and informal efforts towards improvements.
4. Movement towards marker-based mechanisms for water allocation
China’s movement towards market-based mechanisms to allocate water partly came with the recognition that it is equally or more important to manage water from the demand side. It is also in line with the essence of China’s economic reform: the use of economic incentives to boost perfor- mance in the industrial and agricultural sectors. China’s Government has been focusing on two economic instruments: irrigation water price and tradable water rights. This section describes the progress of the government’s efforts in promoting the use of both instruments to manage irrigation water over the past 40 years, as well as challenges encountered in these reforms.
4.1. Irrigation prices
Over the past 40 years, the reform of China’s irrigation price policy has made some progress, though mainly in terms of cost recovery rather than demand management. After the first water-fee regulation in 1985, irrigation supply transformed from being fully subsidised to incurring a supply cost fee. In 1992, price bureaus took over the management responsibilities of irrigation fee from the Water Resource Bureaus, changing the nature of the fee from an administrative issue to a commodity. Then, the irrigation fee further changed from a single to a two-part structure in the last two decades. The two parts include a basic fee charged by area and a volumetric fee charged by the amount of irrigation. The scarcity value of water resource was added as a component of irrigation fee by collecting water resource fee in the past decade. In addition, from 2016, the central Government began selecting regions to set up pilot projects to shift from water resource fees to water resource taxes. Finally, irrigation price changed from a single component to a comprehensive package in the last decade. The Government consequently realised that irrigation price reform should be supported by improving the conditions of irrigation facilities and institutional innovation (such as establishing WUAs).
These reforms mainly relate to prices of surface water resource for irrigation, not for groundwater. For groundwater irrigation, farmers pay for electricity or diesel for pumping water but do not need to pay a resource fee. Collecting groundwater resource fees is Government’s expectation. However, due to high implementation costs this has not happened. In addition to the electricity or diesel charges, farmers also bear some fixed costs associated with groundwater pumping, either through investing in tube wells or paying a management fee for those tube wells funded by village collectives. In addition, due to lack of government control, two-part structure of irrigation price also does not apply for groundwater. Therefore, groundwater irrigation costs are mainly influenced by energy prices and the cost of drilling tube wells.
Despite the Government’s efforts to reform irrigation charges, the current charges are far from satisfactory and do not facilitate efficient water-use by farmers. Effective reforms must first address the challenges outlined below.
First, in spite of a modest increase, the current irrigation price is still low, which makes it difficult to cover the supply cost and reflect the scarcity value of water resource. As shown in Figure 5, the surface irrigation price in Zhangye Prefecture increased 35 times from 0.006 yuan/m3 in 1981 to 0.216 yuan/m3 in 2016. Even so, the current irrigation price only covers 70 per cent of the supply cost. Sun et al. (2018) found that the value of the marginal product of irrigation water in Zhangye is 0.48 yuan/m3, higher than the irrigation price. That is, the current irrigation price doesnot reflect the scarcity value of water. Huang et al. (2010a) also revealed similar evidence for NCP.
Second, because of poor measurement facilities and high implementation cost, it is hard to implement volumetric irrigation fees in the field. Our CWIM data show that 83 per cent of the plots were charged a surface irrigation fee by area in 2001; this number declined to 65 per cent in 2015. In some regions, irrigation fee by area was replaced by time, and in 2015, 27 per cent of the plots charged fees using this approach. Charging an irrigation fee by time is closer to by volume, dramatically improves the collection of irrigation fees. Compared with surface irrigation, charging an irrigation fee by time for groundwater was higher; it reached 36 per cent in 2015. Since most tube wells include electricity measurement, it is common to collect groundwater irrigation fees based on electricity use (59 per cent in 2015). In the past two decades, some local Governments have set up pilot projects to install integrated circuit cards (IC) to directly regulate the pump rates of individual farmers. However, because of high transaction costs (such as facility investment, maintenance, and monitoring cost), IC cards were not extended to non-pilot project sites (Wang et al. 2019).
Finally, increasing irrigation fee conflicts with the policy goal of raising farmer income. Based on empirical studies, we found that the irrigation demand price elasticity for wheat was 0.18 and 0.35 for maize, in the Northern China. The low demand elasticity for irrigation is also common in globally (Moore et al. 1994; Scheierling et al. 2006). Therefore, to encourage farmers to decrease irrigation by a percentage, policymakers must increase the irrigation price by a larger percentage. However, doing so would negatively affect farmers’ income, leading to a policy conflict (Huang et al. 2010a; Wang et al. 2016). In fact, with the implementation of the agriculture tax exemption and the grain subsidy policy from 2004, some developed regions in China have even exempted farmers from irrigation fees to further reduce their financial burden (Wang 2012). Without a rational irrigation price, farmers have no incentives to make intensive and extensive adjustment to their production behaviour in order to increase irrigation efficiency (Dinar and Mody 2004; Huang et al. 2010a; Wang et al. 2016). Thus, Huang et al. (2010a) proposed developing a subsidy program that transfers income to households as compensation for farmers’ lost income from irrigation price reform.
Consistent with prior scholarship, the Hebei pilot reform indicates that designing a suitable subsidy program could enable a win-win strategy of agricultural pricing reform (Wang et al. 2016). Since 2005, as the national pilot project site of ‘Establishing Water Saving Society’, Taocheng District in Hebei Province has been implementing the ‘Increase Price and Provide Subsidy’ reform for groundwater irrigation reform. Prices of groundwater for irrigation were raised in the villages that implemented the program. As a result, the villages generally would collect a higher amount of total irrigation fees. The additional irrigation fees collected (compared to the before-program period) were reallocated back to all farmers equally based on the size of their irrigated land and are not tied to the amount of groundwater used. Since groundwater is volumetrically priced, higher prices would incentivise farmers to reduce withdrawal of groundwater. The subsidies (reallocated irrigation fees) buffer against the negative impacts of higher irrigation costs. In those villages that implemented the program, irrigational application rates were reduced by 21 per cent for both wheat and cotton, partly because farmers were more likely to adopt water-saving technologies (Wang et al. 2016).
Despite the notable success of Hebei’s irrigation price reform in the pilot site, it has not been extended to other regions since its initiation in 2005. Wang et al. (2016) found that, in Taocheng District, considering the time-consuming management and low financial subsidy, a few villages ceased their participation in the reform. In the pilot reform, wheat farmers received, on average, a subsidy of 181 yuan per ha, that is only 11 per cent of the agricultural subsidy in China. There is also no specific financial source to provide subsidy for farmers in the long-term. Therefore, if the Government would like to extend this price mechanism to other regions, a financial support system should be designed and established. In addition, such pilot project has not been set up for reforming surface irrigation price. Compared with groundwater that can link its irrigation fee with electricity use due to availability of electricity measurements, it is even harder to reform surface irrigation price.
4.2. Water rights system and water markets
China’s Government has been trying to set up a water rights system and allocate water through market mechanisms since the early 2000s (Calow et al. 2009). In theory, regulatory caps on total water use within a given region in a rational water rights system can lead to socially optimal allocation of water resource; thus, water can be used by those who value it most (Howe et al. 1986; Debaere et al. 2014). Considering the potential benefit, the central Government has been issuing regulations to promote the development of a water rights system over the last two decades. The first two important regulations were issued in 2005: Some Opinions on Water Rights Transfer and Establishing Framework of Water Rights System. In 2014, the Government launched formal pilot projects in seven provinces to further accelerate development. These provinces included Ninxia, Jiangxi, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Gansu and Guangdong. To support the implementation of pilot projects and encourage water rights transaction among regions, sectors and individual water users, the MWR issued the Temporary Management Regulation on Water Rights’ Transfer in 2016. In the same year, the first national Transaction Institute of Water Rights was established in Beijing. So far, only a few pilot projects of water rights transfer have been considered successful, especially for trade among regions and industries. For example, there are two prominent water rights transfer projects (Speed 2009; Moore 2015); between Dongyang and Yiwu in Zhejiang Province, and between agricultural and industrial sectors in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Provinces. Though successful, they are mainly coordinated by local govern- ments; water users in these regions have not been directly involved in the transaction.
It is more difficult to establish a water rights system to promote rights transfer among irrigation water users in rural areas. At the ID level, water rights have only been granted to farmers at a few select pilot sites, where water rights transactions among individual farmers are not always effective (Sun et al. 2016). Our field surveys in China seldom found evidence of water rights’ transfer among farmers. In fact, many farmers are unaware of their water-use rights or that they can be traded. A typical example for establishing a water rights system in rural areas is the institutional reform in Zhangye Prefecture in Gansu Province. Here, water rights have been granted to individual farmers in the form of water rights certificates. These certificates state the upper limit of the amount of water a household can buy, which is computed by the water rights area and crop irrigation quota. Even so, transactions involving water rights are rare in Zhangye. Importantly, because of poor implementation and high monitoring cost, water rights certificates do not have a sustainable function in reducing irrigation. They only played a significant role in the early stages of reform, where irrigation of wheat reduced by 23 per cent (before 2010). Our survey also found that farmers paid almost no penalty for exceeding their water rights, which encouraged them to use yet more water.
Despite progress made in establishing a water rights system and developing water markets, China still faces challenges in expanding reforms. There has been heated debate on the suitability of water markets in rural areas. The major issue is that initial water rights have not yet been allocated to various water users in most regions (Wang et al. 2017). It is thus impossible to develop water markets without a fully established water rights system. Recently, a water quota system has been suggested for allocating initial water rights to users. However, there is no clear agreement on the relationship between the water rights system and the water quota policy. In addition, the implementation of a water quota policy in rural areas has been slow because of lack of measurement facilities and the high cost of monitoring the large number of small-scale farmers. Therefore, some officials and scholars question the suitability of water markets in rural China, at least at the individual farmer level. If possible, it is better to encourage trade at the level of WUAs or IDs. Lewis and Zheng (2018) noted that promoting water trade at the WUA level requires strong efforts to encourage farmers to participate in the activities of WUAs. Finally, the potential effects of water rights transfer on disadvantaged water users and on the environment also need to be seriously considered (Johansson et al. 2002; Heaney et al. 2005; Etchells et al. 2006). For example, if rights are based on diversions rather than consumptive use, there is a risk that other users and uses of water depending on return flows will be impacted (Table 3).
5. Adopting irrigation technologies to save water
One of the potential solutions China’s Government can consider to address water shortage problems is higher on-farm irrigation efficiency. The use of irrigation technologies is considered as the main tool to boost irrigation efficiency. Traditional irrigation technologies that are used for saving water, such as field levelling and border and furrow irrigation (Blanke et al. 2007), were already in use by farmer before reforms. Paradoxically, their adoption slowed after reforms. These technologies are divisible; that is, one farm household can adopt the practice independent of the action of its neighbours. They have relatively low fixed costs and their major investment is the labour input. The ease and low cost of organising rural labour by a village collective, it is not surprising to find wide adoption of technologies even before the 1980s. Our NCWRS data found that, by 1978, 59 per cent of villages had adopted traditional technologies, and 75 per cent by 2016. Regarding adoption intensity, less than half the crop sown areas used traditional technologies in 2016.
Conversely, household-based technologies came into use only after the 1980s, with higher adoption rates in the last two decades. Such technologies include surface pipes, drought-resistant crop, plastic sheeting, and retaining stub/low till (Blanke et al. 2007). Like traditional technologies, these technologies do not require large capital investment upfront and they can be easily used by individual households. Before rural reforms, household- based technology adoption was non-existent. Then, in the early 1990s, it accelerated. By the 1980s, only 5 per cent of villages in Northern China had adopted these technologies, which increased to 19 per cent by 1990 and 74 per cent by 2016. Regarding adoption intensity, half the crop sown areas used household-based technologies. These adoption trends reflect farmers’ response to increasing pressures of irrigation supply.
In the last two decades, the Government has seriously emphasised adoption of irrigation technologies in rural China. To improve irrigation efficiency and help release saved water for other uses and users, beginning with the late 1990s, the government launched a large program for upgrading, renovating and investing in water-saving facilities of large-scale and middle- scale IDs. The most important investment of this program is to line the main and branch canals with concrete and install underground pipes to improve delivery efficiency of irrigation supply. In 2009, the General Office of the State Council of China issued a document on ‘National Water-saving Irrigation Planning’. It specified that, by 2020, the area irrigated under water-saving irrigation projects should reach 80 per cent of the nation’s effective irrigated land area. This plan will encourage and subsidise the adoption of modern irrigation technologies (such as sprinklers, drip irrigation, and micro-irriga- tion). China’s central and local governments have also set up pilot projects to demonstrate and expand irrigation technologies to new areas. From 2000 to 2017, irrigated land areas adopting irrigation technologies doubled, and the share of overall irrigated land increased from 31 per cent to 50 per cent (Table 4). The significance of financial subsidies, pilot projects and extension services provided by the Government to encourage farmers to adopt irrigation technologies is confirmed by our empirical analysis (Cremades et al. 2015). The analysis also reveals the importance of increasing irrigation fees so farmers adopt irrigation technologies (Cremades et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016).
With more government investments, adoption of community-based irriga- tion technologies has increased since 2000. As Blanke et al. (2007) noted, because of high investment cost and indivisible characteristics, canal lining, underground pipe, sprinklers, drip irrigation, and micro-irrigation belong to community-based irrigation technologies. Constrained by their characteristics, such technologies are always adopted at the village level or at least group level, but not by individual households. Like household-based technologies, in the early reform period, adoption of community-based technologies was non-existent, an increasing trend seen after 2000. From 2000 to 2016, the share of villages adopting community-based technologies increased from 13 per cent to 53 per cent in Northern China. According to statistical data of the MWR, canal lining and underground pipes are two major community-based technologies adopted in China. However, the adoption of sprinkler and drip irrigation was low, <10 per cent of irrigated land (Table 4).
Despite policymakers stressing on the importance of water conservation, the effects of adopting irrigation technologies have been debatable. In theory, such technologies should reduce water use and improve irrigation efficiency by reducing water loss during delivery processes in the canal and field. However, as Peterson and Ding (2005) and Ward and Pulido-Velazquez (2008), among others, have noted, adopting these technologies may or may not reduce water use, depending on a variety of economic and hydrologic factors. In addition, after adopting irrigation technologies with better efficiency, profit-maximising producers may respond by expanding irrigated acreage or move to more water-intensive crops (Huffaker and Whittlesey 1995; Ward and Pulido-Velazquez 2008). The econometric analysis in Northern China by Huang et al. (2017) found that adopting household and community-based technologies can reduce crop water use and improve the productivity of water. However, there were no significant effects on crop mix, irrigated area sown, or the share of a crop area that is irrigated.
6. Looking forward in the future: challenges and opportunities
China has made remarkable progress in the irrigation sector in the past 40 years. In spite of stagnation in the 1980s, irrigated land areas have expanded, with half the cultivated land being equipped with irrigation facilities. Nevertheless, the increase of total withdrawal for agricultural water resource is not substantial. One reason for this is the improvement of irrigation efficiency. Further, investments in water infrastructure are now a policy priority. Both surface and groundwater irrigation systems have also experienced a profound transformation from collective ownership to own- ership by individuals or farmers’ organisation. Farmers have not only become major investors in some rural irrigation facilities (such as tube wells), but they have also taken over full or partial responsibility for irrigation management. Moreover, reforms in irrigation price have been gradually promoted and improved as an incentive mechanism. Finally, the general legal framework of and regulations on the establishment of a water rights system has been designed, and pilot projects on water trade have been implemented.
Despite numerous achievements, policymakers still face many challenges. First, reforms during the last 40 years have not led to significant mitigation of water scarcity. Second, sustainable irrigation in agriculture continues to be a major challenge. Therefore, the Government should continue to tackle impending resource scarcity. Third, innovations in the groundwater irrigation system by farmers have increased groundwater depletion. Declining ground- water levels suggest the Government act with urgency to sustain groundwater stocks. Fourth, the resulting performance of surface irrigation institutions is inconclusive and requires greater public scrutiny. Moreover, irrigation price reforms have been far from satisfactory given their expected outcomes. In the context of inelastic irrigation demand and low farmer income, policymakers can be improved with win–win irrigation price policies and regulatory reforms that effectively ’cap’ withdrawals within sustainable limits. Another issue fraught with uncertainty is whether it is possible to establish a rational water rights system that encourages farmers to participate in water markets. Finally, despite progress, the adoption of irrigation technologies and methods that generate real water savings is not sufficient. Given the slow progress of improved irrigation price policies, farmers’ have faced few incentives to adopt improved irrigation technologies. Nevertheless, there are some opportunities that would allow the Chinese Government to cope with the challenges outlined herein.
First, policymakers are already keen on sustainability of water use. The Rural Revitalization Strategy issued by the central government in 2018 particularly focuses on implementation of rural water-saving actions and establishing water- saving societies in rural areas. It clearly directs reform towards an effective water- saving mechanism and corresponding subsidy policies.
Second, China’s Government has relaxed its food security goal; conflicts between food security and sustainable development of irrigation water could be mitigated to an extent. Recently, the Government has also begun to implement land fallow subsidy policies to resolve groundwater overdraft issues in Northern China. This is a highly important policy change with the potential to significantly reduce the consumption of water resource and realise water saving.
Finally, the Government is encouraging farmers to rent their lands to farmers with better capacity to manage large areas. That is, in the future, farming management will have transferred from small to larger farm sizes. This transition will have a significant effect on adoption of irrigation technologies, reforms in the irrigation institution and incentive mechanisms. According to extant studies, larger farms are more likely to adopt modern irrigation technologies than are small farms. Possibly it also benefits for organising effective WUAs, implement- ing irrigation price reforms and establishing a water rights system also possibly benefits the effective organising of WUAs. These areas require scholars to conduct further theoretical and empirical studies.

20,Interactions between market reform and a carbon price in China’s power sector,"The electricity sector accounts for a large share of China’s carbon dioxide emissions and of the economy-wide abatement potential. China’s planned national emissions trading scheme would include electricity generation, as nearly all emissions trading schemes do. The critical difference is that in most existing carbon pricing systems the power sector operates with competitive markets and cost-based pricing, while the Chinese power industry still uses a highly regulated dispatch and pricing system. Together these limitations mean that the effect of a carbon price on China is limited in terms of the impact on operational decisions for existing power stations and in terms of the effects on investment decisions. We explore the channels of interaction between electricity market reform and carbon pricing in China, and provide quantitative estimates of the effects and interactions on electricity sector emissions. A probabilistic discrete choice model is used to simulate the behavior of investors in the power sector. The analysis indicates that market reform can help reduce emissions intensity, but to meet China’s 2030 targets for non-fossil fuel generation a low to moderate carbon price is also necessary; conversely, a carbon price will only be effective with market reform that provides flexibility in dispatch. Using our simplified quantitative analysis, the carbon price required for the same share of non-fossil fuel generation would be about twice as high without market reform. Combining market reform and a carbon price could achieve significant rates of decarbonization and is likely to be the most effective and most feasibly policy package to cut emissions from China’s power sector.","1. INTRODUCTION For China, the largest CO2 emitter and soon to be largest economy in the world, low-car- bon development has become an urgent need and policy priority. China’s rapidly growing energy consumption and its heavy reliance on coal have created serious environmental prob- lems, including local air pollution and depletion of water resources. Transition to a low-carbon energy system will not only bring significant local environmental and health benefits, but can aid with the economic structural change that China is striving for, and holds the promise of benefits for industrial innovation and energy security. Together with the expected long-term benefits in reducing climate change impacts, these factors mean that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is in China’s economic self-interest (Teng and Jotzo 2014).
Energy accounts for the largest share of China’s greenhouse gas emissions (77% in 2005, the latest year for which a full inventory was submitted to the UNFCCC). The electricity sec- tor in turn is the largest contributor to China’s energy emission, accounting for about 30% of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion in the year 2015 (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and Joint Research Centre 2016). The electricity sector will need to play a key role in achieving China’s target to peak its emission around 2030 (see Table 1). In the coming decade, China’s power production will very likely continue to expand, as increased demand for electricity-based energy services in industry, buildings and increasingly transport outstrips the rate of efficiency improvements. Thus, whether or not China can decarbonize its power sector will matter greatly for the national emissions trajectory.
Market-based instruments such as carbon tax and emissions trading schemes (ETS, also referred to as cap-and-trade schemes) are regarded as important means to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reduction at least cost. A number of countries and subnational jurisdictions have emissions trading scheme or carbon taxes in place. China has also launched carbon pilot mar- kets in two provinces and five cities, starting from 2013 (Zhang et al. 2014; Jotzo and Loeschel 2014). A national ETS is scheduled to start in 2017. The power industry has been included in China’s regional pilot schemes and is slated for inclusion in the national scheme.
In most jurisdictions that have ETS or carbon taxes that cover the power sector, the elec- tricity sector is fully or partly liberalized, typically with markets for electricity generation and with changes in the cost of electricity generation reflected in changing electricity prices. Chi- na’s electricity sector however is not liberalized. Competition has been only partly introduced in electricity generation, and retail pricing in China is still largely under regulation.
Where the pricing system has a limited role in allocating resources and investment, a price on carbon emissions will likewise only have a limited effect. Thus, the effectiveness of China’s ETS will in part depend on the nature and extent of electricity sector reform, as well as the interaction between electricity reform and the design of the ETS. At the same time, market reform by itself will alter the generating mix and thereby the emissions outcome.
This paper aims to make a contribution to understanding of the interaction of the two elements of energy and climate policy in China, through qualitative assessment of the interac- tion and the functioning of China’s electricity system, and through a preliminary quantitative assessment of selected aspects of electricity market reform and carbon pricing.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we provide a qualitative analysis of the effects and interactions of electricity sector reform and carbon pricing; in Section 3, we review the power pricing and dispatching system in China; in Section 4, we set out a framework for modelling investment decisions in the power sector and apply this framework to analyze the policy interaction between electricity reform and ETS in China; in Section 5, we discuss mod- elling results and their implications; Section 6 concludes.
f 2. EFFECTS AND INTERACTIONS OF CARBON PRICING AND ELECTRICITY g MARKET REFORM
As a market based instrument, a price on emissions—whether by way of tradable permits (ETS) or an emissions tax—requires prices for polluting goods and services to be set in markets in order to be effective. In the hypothetical situation of perfect command-and-control, where the supply of a com- modity like electricity and the methods for its production (or the respective prices) are fully determined by government, putting a price on emissions will not change the amount of emis- sions. The theory of carbon pricing—and much of the empirical modelling thereof—usually starts from the assumption of perfect markets. The reality in electricity supply is usually some- where in-between, with markets operating close to perfectly in some aspects or situations, and imperfectly or not at all in others. The situation can differ greatly between jurisdictions and over time, depending on the regulatory framework.
2.1 Effects of carbon pricing on emissions and their prerequisites in markets
A carbon price in the power sector under market settings creates incentives to reduce emis- sions through three main channels:
Firstly, incentives for lower-emissions investment in power supply. Putting a price on carbon emissions favours investment in lower-emissions options by making lower-emissions power plants relatively more profitable. Prerequisites for the investment incentives to eventuate in- clude that market settings allow higher profits to accrue to lower emissions plants, and for the design of carbon pricing schemes to facilitate differential financial effects on different types of power stations. In practice, the investment incentives are sometimes muted through design of carbon pricing that reduces the impact of carbon prices on relative profitability, for example allocating free emissions permits to high-emitting plants for free in line with electricity output. There are also examples where the expectation that a legislated carbon price would be abolished in future neutered investment effects (O’Gorman and Jotzo 2012).
Secondly, changes in the merit order electricity dispatch. A carbon price increases the short- run variable cost of fossil fuel power plants, in line with their emissions intensity. Thereby lower-emissions plants move higher up the merit order (the ordering according to cost of all power stations available for dispatch on the grid), and in a market-based system of dispatch the annual operating hours for high-emissions plants (for example low-efficiency coal plants) will reduce relative to dispatchable lower-emissions plants (for example gas turbines or high-ef- ficiency coal plants). Lower annual operating hours for high-emissions plants contribute to a reduction in their profitability and hence contribute to investment incentives. Prerequisites for the carbon price to efficiently affect dispatch of existing power stations is for the dispatch to be based on relative costs, usually through a market system such as a wholesale spot market for electricity, or through a regulated system that is based on relative costs including carbon costs. Spot markets have been implemented in many countries in recent decades but have not always been a feature of power systems. In many countries they do not exist, or exist only to a limited extent. Spot markets typically exist in parallel with contracts for the supply of electricity to specific customers, for example industrial users or utilities.
Thirdly, a reduction in electricity demand in response to higher electricity prices, as carbon costs are passed through to end users who have greater incentives to save electricity or substi- tute to other energy sources. In a fully market based electricity system, the carbon costs are passed through via wholesale markets to industrial customers and via retail markets to domes- tic electricity users.
Prerequisites for full carbon cost pass through include fully market based electricity pric- ing, with competitive markets. This is fundamentally the case in many electricity markets, though market power may limit cost pass-through (Chernyavs’ka and Gulli 2008). In some jurisdictions, governments hold electricity prices fixed at least for some groups of users (such as residential electricity users) for political or distributional reasons.
2.2 Design of emissions trading schemes to address lack of markets
Where markets are imperfect or missing, emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes can be designed to compensate for the limitations that stem from a lack of free markets. The main application for this is where electricity supply prices are fixed.
If power prices are fixed by regulation, a straightforward way to reflect a carbon price in electricity prices is to raise the regulated price faced by end-users by an amount that is com- mensurate with the carbon price on the electricity supply side. This direct approach has some downsides however. In the case of an ETS with a floating price, to achieve equivalence the regulated price may need to be adjusted at regular intervals. Furthermore, it may be politically difficult to directly adjust regulated power prices.
An alternative approach is to make large users of electricity part of ETS systems, by requir- ing them to cover the emissions attributable to their power use by emissions permits. “Indirect emissions” from electricity use are covered in this way in the Tokyo ETS and Korean ETS (Kim and Lim 2014; Park and Hong 2014) and the Chinese ETS pilot schemes (see Zhang 2015; Zhang et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014; Munnings et al. 2016). This option has also been referred to as the “demand side levy model”, and is seen as a relatively straightforward way to achieve price-based incentives to reduce electricity demand when market liberalization is not possible (Teng et al. 2014). Downsides are that there are additional transaction costs, and that the cov- erage is limited to large users of electricity, creating threshold effects. By contrast, where direct cost-pass through is possible, all electricity users have an automatic incentive to make extra efforts to save energy, without engaging in the carbon market.
Fixed power prices can also affect the design and effectiveness of carbon pricing schemes on the supply side. Where there is no or limited carbon cost pass-through to electricity users, regulators face increased pressures to shield electricity generators from the financial effects of carbon pricing. A ‘pure’ carbon pricing model without free permits (or carbon tax rebates) in the absence of cost pass-through would reduce overall electricity industry profits. As a result, ETS are sometimes designed with output-based allocation of free emissions permits, which in turn can reduce the effectiveness of a carbon price on changing the supply mix in electricity. 2.3 Effects of electricity market liberalization on emissions and interactions
with carbon pricing
Moving from a regulated electricity system to a market-based system will usually affect the electricity supply mix as well as the amount of electricity used, and with its emissions. Whether power market liberalization in itself increases or decreases emissions depends on the particular circumstances.
Liberalizing electricity markets—and more generally energy markets, i.e. prices for fuels— in any respect will change the relative profitability of different types of power plants, and hence investment incentives. Changes in profitability can occur through lower or higher electricity prices (through lifting price controls), lower or higher input costs (if fuel costs are regulated), and lower or higher capacity utilization factors (through changes in dispatch systems).
Whether a move to market settings on balance puts high-emissions plants or low-emis- sions plants at an advantage depends on how the regulatory settings compare to the market outcomes. Thus, partial or full electricity market liberalization by itself could result in higher emissions or in lower emissions. It will also affect overall system costs and the distribution of costs and revenue between electricity generators.
Where market liberalization by itself increases emissions but increases the effectiveness of carbon pricing, there could be a ‘break-even’ level of the carbon price required to keep emis- sions the same as without electricity market liberalization. Conversely, it is also possible that the two interventions both reduce emissions and the combination has an amplified effect on emissions.
f 3. CHINA’S POWER INDUSTRY: PRICING AND DISPATCH g
Regulatory reform in China’s electricity sector began in the year 2002 starting from the separation of the monopoly State Power into five regional power generation companies and two transmission companies (Xu and Chen 2006). After years of rapid growth, China’s elec- tricity consumption growth has recently begun to slow down, also in the context of slowing economic growth. This has been considered as an opportunity to implement further reform measures in power market. In 2014, a new round of electricity reform started, focusing on the transmission and distribution sectors. The reform is characterized by two aspects: first, reform of transmission and distribution tariff based on principle of “cost plus reasonable profit;” sec- ond, opening up of electricity retail to non-state-owned companies. It is also proposed that a real time electricity market will be developed, and that large consumers will also be required to buy electricity directly in the market from power generators or retail electricity companies. However, currently the electricity sector is still under a fully regulated price and “equal gener- ation hour” dispatch rules as detailed below.
3.1 Electricity pricing
Although the ultimate objective of the new electricity market reform is to introduce com- petition in both wholesale and retail markets, and to gradually allow prices to be more respon- sive to supply and demand, the electricity pricing system is still highly regulated (Liu and Kong 2016).
In China, the electricity retail price consists of several parts: power purchase cost (whole- sale generation price), charge for transmission and distribution losses, transmission and distribution tariff and government funds. Generally, power purchase costs account for about 65% to 70% of the electricity retail price. Both the wholesale generation price and the retail price are adjusted regularly. For most coal based generation units, their on-grid tariff is determined based on the province-specific benchmark tariff, which is estimated based on average invest- ment and operating cost in each of China’s provinces.
Since the year 2005, the wholesale generation price has been linked with the coal price. The linking mechanism is designed to trigger adjustment of the wholesale generation price if the coal price reaches a predetermined threshold. Theoretically, the electricity retail price is also adjusted regularly on the basis of the wholesale generation price. But such price adjustments only apply to industrial and commercial consumers who are subject to a higher retail price than the national average. For household and agricultural consumers, the electricity retail price is relatively stable and lower than the average price. Thus, both wholesale prices and retail prices in China are not in line with energy costs. This has led to erratic investment patterns and pe- riodic shortages in electricity supply.
3.2 Dispatching system in China
In earlier times when the whole electricity sector was operated by the only state own company, State Power, dispatch of power stations was based on the least cost principle. After the market reform of separating generation assets from transmission and distribution, the dis- patching system was largely constrained by contracts between generators and grid company that were signed in the early stage of market reform (Kahrl et al. 2013). To give incentives to capacity expansion serving the fast growing load, grid companies signed fixed price and quota contracts with investors to reduce their risk and attract investment.
In this circumstance, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Chi- na’s main economic management agency, began to stimulate the construction of power plants by publishing a dispatching rule which ensured approximately similar annual generation hours of similar kinds of generation units in each province. The so called “equal generation and uti- lization hours” dispatching model has been used up to now (Ding et al. 2013; Gao and Yang 2010). In this dispatching system, the provincial dispatching authorities firstly allocate the an- nual generation quotas to different power plants1 based on the equal utilization hours principle and demand estimation. The dispatching center then determines the monthly and daily gener- ation schedule based on monthly and daily demand and physical constraints on grid operation.
Such “equal share dispatch” is not cost effective, as it means that the less efficient genera- tion units will be operated as much as the most efficient ones. China has implemented pilot programs for energy-saving power dispatch since the end of 2007 (Gao and Yang 2010). Under energy-saving dispatch, the generation units are ranked according to their energy consumption and pollutant emission levels. The operator will then call on different generation units with a view to minimizing energy and resource consumption and emissions. The merit order of energy-saving power dispatch is as follows: renewables, nuclear, cogeneration, natural gas, coal and oil generators.
However, those energy saving dispatch pilots have not been successful in China. The major barrier is that the shift of dispatch rules reduces the profit of grid companies by prioritizing re- newable energy. In addition, it changes the distribution of financial revenue among generators, so financial compensation is a key to the effective implementation of the energy saving power dispatch. Because of the lack of compensation plans, some pilot provinces such as Sichuan withdrew from energy saving dispatch and replaced it with “equal generation hour” dispatch.
f 4. MODELS AND METHODOLOGIES g
The interaction between the carbon pricing and electricity market reform in China can be modeled as a two-stage problem. In the first stage, the dispatching entities will determine the generation scheduling through dispatch rules. The dispatch rules determine the merit order, and in turn determine annual generation hours of different generation technologies. In the second stage, investors choose to invest in different generation technologies, based on relative costs and expected future revenues. Lower annual operating hours for a given generation tech- nology will contribute to a reduction in their profitability and hence less investment. Due to the lack of a national dispatch model to analyze these effect, we use a simplified methodology to capture the effects of different dispatch regimes and a carbon price.
In the short term, approximated by the first stage of our analysis, a change of dispatching rules (and/or introduction of a price on carbon emissions) will change the utilization hours of different generation units. Under an “equal generation hours” dispatch rules, the utilization hours of the similar generation technologies are almost the same. The dispatch entities have incentives to abandon generation of renewables to minimize their power purchase cost, thus leading to higher curtailment of renewable power.
Under the market reform scenario, we assume that an energy saving generation dispatch will be adopted giving priority to the most efficient fossil fuel based units and the zero-emis- sions generators. The impact on change of utilization hours can be estimated on the basis of existing estimates without the use of a dispatch model.
In the second stage, we consider a case where potential investors decide which power gen- eration technologies to invest in. We use a logit model to represent the choices among various generation technologies. The approach differs from the traditional calculation of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) which considers the cost of electricity generation technologies fixed and is the only indicator for technology choice. Logit models give recognition to a range of factors beyond the averaged expected cost in determining the specific investment decisions in genera- tors of different technologies. This may include geographical factors differentially affecting the production possibilities and cost of different generation technologies, local investment oppor- tunities and preferences, demand profiles, and so forth. These factors are often not adequately represented in models of electricity sector investment.
Logit models can capture in an aggregate way factors that influence the decision variables but are not directly observable, such as patterns of substitution across various generation tech- nologies other than observed variables such as LCOE. For example, logit models have long been used successfully to model the choice of consumers in choosing between different brands of objectively similar products (e.g. Guadagni and Little 1983). We take this approach to cre- ate a quantitative representation of power mix choices. The logit model approach also assumes that unobserved factors affecting decisions are independent over repeated investment choices.
The traditional approach is to use dispatch models that incorporate technical and cost data for all power stations; and to couple this with a longer-term model of investment choices which should reflect different LCOEs, risk profiles, capital costs, demand profiles and so forth. However, reliable dispatch models at this point are not available for China, on account of data limitations; and the modelling of investment is fundamentally subject to assumptions about future market conditions.
In the logit model, we posit that the different primary fuels will compete for the gener- ation of a secondary fuel or energy service. The price of each fuel is assumed to fall within a fuel-price range, while the related variance is captured in an energy price exponent (Clarke and Edmonds 1993). The market share of each competing technology is determined by the comparison of its own price and variance with others, and formally calculated by means of logit share equation. Hence, the share Sj of technology j allocated to a competitive market is expressed as Equation (1). Here, Pj is the LCOE of technology j, rp is the price exponent which stands for the rate that the implementation of this technology in response to a change in the cost, thus is also known as the elasticity, while bj is the base share of technology j.
A standard formula to calculate the LCOE is shown in Equation (2), where Ii(t), OMi(t), Fi(t), CiCO2(t) and EPi(t) denote the investment cost, operation & maintenance cost, fuel costs, carbon costs due to emission quota or carbon tax, and the expected electricity production, while r denotes the discount rate. We use the logit model as follows. Firstly, we calculate the LCOE of each generation tech- nology. Then we calibrate the logit model to the IEA’s Current Policy Scenario (CPS),2 result- ing in a set of parameters bj and rp3 in Equation 1. We then establish several policy scenarios on the market reform and carbon price which will change the LCOE accordingly (as explained in the previous section) but will not change the parameters on bj and rp.
The introduction of carbon pricing will change the CiCO2(t) component of LCOE for dif- ferent generation technologies. The change of dispatch rules will change the EPi(t) component of generation technology i. We then run the model to estimate changes in market shares for different technologies under various scenarios. f 5. SCENARIOS AND RESULTS g 5.1 Scenarios design
We consider four scenarios for the impact of market reform and introduction of a carbon price in China’s electricity sector.
(1) The first scenario is a base case scenario. In this base case, we assume there is no carbon price in the electricity sector and the “equal generation hours” dispatch rules remain. (2) The second scenario is the market reform scenario. We assume the power market will be liberalized in year 2020 and that dispatch will be changed from “equal generation hours” principle to energy saving generation dispatch, where the merit order is as follows: renewables, nuclear, cogeneration, natural gas, coal and oil generators. The implementation of energy sav- ing generation dispatch will reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.
The main effect will come from the substitution between large scale coal generation units and small-scale generation units. For example, in the pilot of Jiangsu province, the annual utilization hours of coal fired generation units with capacity over 600 MW are 30% higher than without implementing the energy saving generation dispatch, while the annual utilization hours of coal fired capacity smaller than 200 MW—which are less efficient—are 25% lower than before.
The second effect comes from the reduction of curtailment of renewable energy. Aban- doning the “equal generation hours” approach means that the shedding of renewable energy would be largely resolved. Another contribution to reduction of curtailment could come from the promotion of electricity trading across provinces, providing greater flexibility and further minimizing curtailment of energy from wind and solar power sources.
No studies are available to show to what extent market reform can resolve the issue of curtailment and increase the competitiveness of renewables by increasing its generation hours in the merit order. Based on the historical experience between 2012 and 2014, we assume a 10% improvement in absolute terms from current renewable power curtailment rates,4 which we believe to be a thoroughly conservative assumption.
(3) The third scenario is for a carbon price in the electricity sector. China has announced that the national ETS will start in 2017, however key design elements of the national ETS are still in progress. The electricity sector is to be included in the national ETS but the permit alloca- tion scheme is still not clear, which can have impacts on the effectiveness of the scheme. It is also unclear what price levels may prevail in the Chinese national ETS. As an illustration of a low to moderate carbon price we model a carbon price of 25 RMB/tCO2 (around USD 3.6/ tCO2) in the year 2020, and assume the carbon price increases by 8% per year from 2020 to 2040. It is assumed that the carbon price is additional to existing policy instrument, especially subsidies on renewables.
(4) The fourth scenario is a combination of market reform and ETS. Under this scenario, the power sector will be fully liberalized in year 2020, together with a carbon price of 25 RMB/ tCO2 at 2020 growing by 8% per year thereafter.
Under the assumptions made here about future costs, the LCOE of coal based electricity is still low in comparison with wind and solar power, even if there was a high coal price and high carbon price. To increase the share of renewables in the market share, market reform is likely to be effective because the energy saving generation dispatch will give priorities to renewables and the competition in the spot market will be determined by the variable cost, not the long-term average cost. The crucial insight is that without market reform on dispatch, the introduction of a low to moderate carbon price would only have limited effects on dispatch, and thus limited implication on the emission performance. 5.2 Technology shares
The cost assumptions provide a general sense that coal will still be competitive over the coming decades compared with other alternatives but it is not clear how the technology port- folio will change, given specific circumstances. We then use the logit model—as described in the previous section—to model the impact on the investment decisions.
It should be noted that the logit model is only used to present the investment process and cannot represent the demand side (reductions in electricity consumption), which is also im- portant as explained in the previous section. Thus, of the three channels of effects of a carbon price on emissions levels discussed in section 3, only two are captured in our analysis.
Under the reference scenario (1), the share of coal based technology capacity decreases from 66% in 2010 to less than 50% in year 2030 and about 46% in year 2040. The share of non-fossil fuel capacity (renewable plus nuclear) increases from 26.8% in year 2010 to 43.7% in year 2030 and 47.4% in year 2040 (Table 1, Figure 1). The share of non-fossil fuel genera- tion is 27.5% in year 2020, 31% in year 2030 and 34.6% in year 2040 respectively.
Under the reference scenario, the share of non-fossil fuel generation is lower than the requirement in China’s national target (NDC) which requires the share of non-fossil fuel gen- eration to reach 30% in year 2020 and 40% in year 2030.5 Thus, China’s non-fossil fuel target would not be achieved.
In the market reform scenario (2), we assume that the curtailment of renewable generation will be improved and the LCOE of renewables will be reduced due to the increasing generation hours. As a result, the share of renewable will be higher. Compared with the reference scenario, the share of renewables increases in the short term by avoiding the curtailment of wind and solar power. In 2020, the share of non-fossil fuel generation is 34%, compared to 28% in the reference scenario. By liberalizing the power market, the 2020 national target for the non fossil fuel share can be achieved. However, the 2030 non fossil fuel target is still not met—this would require a 40% non-fossil fuel share in generation, whereas only a 38% share is achieved.
In the carbon price scenario, in the short-term, the share of non-fossil fuel generation is lower than in the market reform scenario—the relatively low carbon price has less effect than the market reform. But together with the assumed rapidly growing carbon price over time, the long-run impact of carbon price begins to dominate. By 2030, the share of non-fossil fuel gen- eration is 37% in the carbon price scenario, similar to that under the market reform scenario.
However, neither the carbon price scenario nor the market reform scenario can achieve the target of 20% non-fossil fuel in primary energy (which is equivalent to 41% percent of non fossil fuel generation in power sector). The only way to achieve this target, under our assump- tions and model, is to combine market reform with a carbon price.
With the combination of a liberalized power market and a growing carbon price through introduction of ETS (scenario 4), the share of non-fossil fuel generation is estimated at 43% in 2030 (see also Figure 2). This is consistent with the target of 20% non fossil fuel share in China’s NDC which support the peaking of China’s emission around 2030.
If the power market cannot be liberalized, then the carbon price needs to be double at 2030 to ensure the non fossil fuel energy target. But a higher carbon price may trigger greater concerns about competiveness in other sectors subject to international competition.
The resulting emission intensity of electricity generation is shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. The reduction of emission intensity is due to the combined effect of the increased share of non-fossil fuel generation and the improvement of efficiency in coal fired power plants. From 2010 to 2015, the annual decarbonization rate was about 3% per year as a result of the two effects combined. 40% of the contribution came from the increase of non-fossil fuel in the generation mix and 60% come from the improvement of efficiency in coal fired power plants.
Without further policy interventions, the decarbonization rate would reduce to around 1% per year by 2020 because the efficiency improvement of coal fired power plants seen in the past, including through replacement of old inefficient with more efficient plants, has been exhausted. To maintain the recent observed decarbonization rate, it is necessary to combine market reform and a carbon price. With the combination of those two effects, the decarboniza- tion rate in electricity supply can be raised to 3.5% per year in 2030, under our assumptions.
Importantly, the impact of market reform by itself is a one-off effect on the decarboniza- tion rate. The long term impact is relative small. By contrast, the carbon price can give a long- term impact on the decarbonization through its influence on investment patterns over time driven by a growing carbon price. However, market reform is a prerequisite for effectiveness of a carbon price. f 6. CONCLUSIONS g
China’s goal to peak its national carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 requires a substan- tial shift towards decarbonization in the power sector. To achieve this requires policy interven- tion and market reform. The current power sector framework tends to lock in the operation of high-emissions power plants and would limit the effectiveness of a carbon price, as under China’s national ETS planned for introduction in 2017. Our quantitative analysis, using a logit model for the power sector, indicates that market reform can deliver benefits by reducing curtailment of renewable power. If China liberalized its power market, then this policy intervention under our assumptions and using our estimation methods can increase the share of non-fossil fuel generation to 34%, consistent with national targets at 2020 for non-fossil fuel in primary energy. Without market reform, to achieve the same level of incentive for development of non-fossil fuel technologies, a relatively low carbon price of around 25 RMB/tCO2 in year 2020 would be needed.
However, neither market reform nor a relatively low carbon price individually would achieve the 2030 target. This can be achieved by combining a carbon price with market reform which can make carbon pricing in China’s power sector more effective. We estimate that with- out market liberalization, in 2030 a carbon price needs to be twice as high than if a carbon price is applied with market reform, in order to achieve the same share of non-fossil fuel gen- eration. By combining a low to moderate carbon price with market reform, significant rates of decarbonization of China’s electricity supply could be achieved and maintained.
Market reform has a one-off benefit by itself, whereas the carbon price can give a long- term impact on the decarbonization through its influence on investment patterns over time driven by a growing carbon price. However, market reform is a prerequisite for effectiveness of a carbon price. Together, market reform and a carbon price signal can incentivize more invest- ment in low carbon generation technologies, and to reduce the utilization hours of fossil fuel generating units.
The introduction of market reform and carbon price would have significant impacts on fi- nancial position of different electricity generation companies. The renewables generating units and large scale coal fired generation units would gain more utilization hours while the small scale inefficient generation unit would have lower capacity utilization. The transitional effects on generators’ profitability can be addressed through appropriate design of ETS rules, includ- ing through time-limited allocation of free emissions permits.
In this paper, we have used a simplified methodology to capture the effects of change in dispatch rules and introduction of carbon price, allowing an illustrative analysis of the key interactions between a carbon price and market reform in China’s electricity supply. In future research, the discrete choice model approach in this paper could be coupled with a generation scheduling model. Also, a more detailed analysis using provincial level data could be under- taken.
The limitations of the quantitative analysis in this paper notwithstanding, it appears a robust conclusion that a combination of market reform and a moderate carbon price is likely to be the most effective and arguably most feasibly policy package to significantly reduce emis- sions intensity, and to cut emissions in China’s power sector.

21,Investment strategy for underground gas storage facilities based on real option model considering gas market reform in China,"Natural gas is expected to play a much more important role in China's energy supply, however, the lack of underground gas storage facilities becomes a serious barrier for its market penetration. Therefore, gas market reform is expected to be incentive for developing gas storage facilities. In the present study, a real option model was proposed to analyse the optimal investment strategy (investment timing and value) for underground gas storage facilities with/without the consideration of gas market reform. Uncertainties in gas market, government incentives and technological improvements were considered. The obtained results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in underground gas storage in China, and that to implement gas market reform would greatly contribute to gas storage construction. With the consideration of gas market reform, the investment of underground gas storage would be executed at 2026 with an investment value of 0.33RMB/m3 if there were no government incentive, while to invest in 2030 would be the best decision without the consideration of gas market reform, and the investment value is only 0.05 RMB/m3. Through a sensitivity analysis, the effects of changes in parameters related to gas market, government incentives and technological improvements on the investment strategy were investigated. The conclusions can provide useful information for gas storage enterprise decision-makers on whether and when to invest underground gas storage facilities in China considering uncertainties.","1. Introduction
In recent years, much attention of China's government has been paid to energy supply side reform, driven by climate change and environ- mental awareness improvement. Natural gas, as a clean energy in the process of low-carbon transformation, has regained focus of policy makers. China promised that the percentage of natural gas in the country's total primary energy consumption will be over 10% by 2020 and increase to 15% by 2030 in its INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). Growing importance of natural gas is an irresistible trend in the near future (Li et al., 2011).Traditionally, natural gas as a seasonal energy, its demand fluctuate greatly in different season, because more natural gas is used for heating in residential and commercial sectors during the winter (Breton and Kharbach, 2008). Especially in China, the contradiction between supply and demand of natural gas is highlighted (Pi et al., 2015a, 2015b). Taking Beijing as an example, maximum monthly gas consumption in winter in 2016 is 6–8 times of the minimum in summer. Unbalance between gas demand and production make gas storage play a vital role in the natural gas industry development, especially in a competitive market (De Jong, 
2015). Underground gas storage facilities with a larger storage capacity and higher security compared to LNG tanks, are widely considered as the most reasonable and effective measures to fundamentally solve the issues of seasonal peak shaving of urban gas (Wei et al., 2016).
According to the data published by International Gas Union (IGU) in 2015, there are about 630 operating underground gas storage facilities in the world, with effective storage capacity of 358.8 billion cubic meters, accounting for 10.3% of global annual natural gas consumption. However, China only has 18 underground gas storage facilities, with 5.5 billion cubic meter available storage capacity, b3% of its annual natural gas consumption of 185.3 billion cubic meters. Obviously, China's gas storage facilities are too rare to meet peak demand of natural gas which is a chokepoint for the fast-growing gas market. What's more, it is predicted that the gap between gas production and demand is going to expand drastically, reaching 210.4 billion cubic meters by 2020 (Wang et al., 2013). Even though China's eastern provinces, as major consumer-provinces of natural gas, do not have the right terrain condi- tions to establish underground gas storage facilities, they can adjust peak demand of natural gas by constructing pipelines. Furthermore, for western and central producer-provinces, it is more economic to transform depleted oil and gas fields to underground gas storage. There- fore, China badly needs to develop greatly underground gas storage facilities. There are mainly two reasons that China's underground storage facilities are far behind the developed countries in terms of quantity and technology. On the one hand, China's natural gas market has always been regulated by the government, thus there is not enough economic stimulus for gas storage facility investment. Fortunately, the Chinese government has introduced numerous policies and development plans to deregulate natural gas market in recent years (Dong et al., 2017). Fur- thermore, a suitable investment assessment method for underground gas storage facilities is necessary for China. Conventional evaluation methods have the defects when dealing with energy investment pro- jects with high uncertainties (Yang et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, a real option model was proposed in this study to evaluate underground gas storage investment in China by considering uncer- tainties in gas market, governmental incentives and technological improvements. The purpose is to find the optimal investment timing of investors, finally to provide suggestions to promote gas storage facilities development based on sensitivity analysis.
2. Literature review
Underground gas storage has a strategic significance for natural gas development in China and previous studies were mainly carried out to explore the operation mode of underground gas storage and storage service pricing mechanism. All the studies are characterized by the conclusion that underground gas storage is expected to operate inde- pendently and adopt market-oriented pricing mechanism (Hong et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016). Facing challenges resulted from markets and complex geologic conditions, it is necessary not only to explore market driven operation modes, but also to strengthen core technological research and development, including geologic evalu- ation, gas reservoir engineering, drilling and completion engineering, injection and gas recovery engineering, surface auxiliary technologies and integrity evaluation (Ding et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). Only a few researchers focused on underground gas storage investment and underground gas storage construction speeding up. Wang et al. (2016) established a real option model to assess the value of underground natural gas storage considering seasonal gas price fluctuation, however, ignoring technological improvements and policies.
As shown in Table 1, real option (RO) method has been applied broadly in the economical assessment of oil projects, gas projects and electricity projects, because of the inherent characteristics of energy infrastructure projects: (i) the irreversibility of investment costs; (ii) the high uncertainty of payoff; (iii) the scarce cumulative information, technology gap and high investment risks; (iv) the strong influence of national policy (Fernandes et al., 2011; Martinez Cesena et al., 2013; Schachter and Mancarlla, 2016). Classic valuation methods have certain limitations on assessing this kind of irreversible programs, because it ignores uncertainties that have great influence on the future cash flow (Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and Payback pe- riod)(Myers and Turnbull, 1977; Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). In terms of uncertainty types, earlier studies mainly focused on market, technology and policy. The major market factor considered is fuel price. In addition, technological uncertainty is reflected in the cost reduction (Manuel and Jose, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). It should be pointed out that there are not many studies focusing on natural gas. Moreover, existing studies concerning natural gas only take uncertainty in fuel price into account. However, as for underground gas storage, apart from prices, there are many uncertain factors affecting its development, which will be exten- sively examined in this study.
Value of natural gas infrastructure investment is closely related to various uncertain factors including gas supply and demand fluctuation, which can be estimated by adopting stochastic methods such as scenario tree (Egging and Holz, 2016). In addition, natural gas price also has great influence on assessment of gas infrastructure investment (Fleten and Näsäkkälä, 2010; Fritsch and Poudineh, 2016). In order to get more accurate results, uncertain factors are often modelled as Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) (Hach and Spinler, 2016) and geo- metric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic process (Pless et al., 2016). Referred to existing literature, this study assumes that uncertain factors follow the GBM.
In terms of China's gas market reform, it can be summarised as four aspects: natural gas administrative system reform, industry structure reform, pricing mechanism reform, and tax and subsidy system reform (Dong et al., 2017). Here, industry structure reform and pricing mecha- nism reform are considered, which have huge impacts on underground gas storage investment value. In February 2014, the National Energy Administration (NEA) stipulated that natural gas storage operating enterprises with spare capacity should open storage facilities to the third parties (Pi et al., 2015a, 2015b). Besides, pricing mechanism reform is aimed at creating a more market-based pricing mechanism, introducing seasonal price disparities and independent gas storage price (Paltsev and Zhang, 2015; Hu and Dong, 2015). In this study, a real option model is established to explore optimal investment strategy (investment timing and value) considering gas market reform. Here, uncertainties in gas market, governmental incentives and technological improvements are considered, and the model is solved by Least Square Monte Carol (LSMC) approach (Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, two scenarios are designed to investigate effects of gas market reform.
There are three differences between the present study and existing ones: i) the purpose of this study is trying to answer the questions that what is the investment value and when to invest underground gas storage is better for investor, while the previous studies didn't solve these two questions simultaneously; ii) in terms of the uncertain factors, the present study considers gas demand and production, invest- ment cost, as well as operation and management cost (OMC), indicating market and technology uncertainties; iii) the present study is conducted in the background of gas market reform, and the policy uncertainties are also considered by designing two scenarios to identify the impacts of gas market reform and consider the time lagged effect. Methodology 3.1. Real option model
We assume that there exists a gas storage facilities project to transform depleted oil and gas fields to underground gas storage with capacity C, which can be irreversibly invested in year t (t0 ≤ t ≤ tn) with investment cost ICt, and the gas storage facilities are supposed to be built in Tc years (construction period) and then keep running for L years (operation period). Since the value of a gas storage project is dependent on many uncertain factors, it is reasonable to express the project value by its expectation. If the investment on a gas storage pro- ject starts in year t, the total net present value of the project can be represented by: where r is discount rate, and CFi denotes the cash flow in year i.
The revenues of the storage operators are mainly from charged fee for the provision of gas storage services. Generally, storage fees are charged on a monthly basis including three parts: returns from gas injection, gas withdrawal and storage capacity occupancy, expressed as ipt, i, wpt, i and zpt, i respectively. Here, we don't consider natural gas leakage. Correspondingly, OMC mainly includes injection cost and with- draw cost, shown as ivt, i and wvt, i respectively. Assuming that cft, i stands for the net cash flow in the month i of year t, Injt, i, Witt, i and Zt, i are represented as respectively the amount of monthly gas injection, withdrawal and working gas. Then we have. Natural gas is a seasonal resource with a high variability in demand. In the troughs of natural gas consumption, superfluous gas is stored in underground storage facilities. In general, gas injection period starts in April and ends in October, and gas recovery period starts in November and ends in February next year. The amount of monthly gas injection and withdrawal are determined respectively by: where inj is gas injection rate, and wit denotes deliverability rate, usually expressed in terms of million cubic meters per day (mcm/d). dI and dW represent days of gas injection period and gas recovery period, respectively. Ii and Wi are injection-production determination factors. If the ith month belongs to injection period, Ii = 1 and Wi = 0. Or else Ii = 0 and Wi = 1. In addition, it should be noted that natural gas stored in underground gas storage consists of two parts, base gas and working gas, of which the former is the volume of natural gas intended as permanent inventory in a storage reservoir to maintain adequate pressure and deliverability rates throughout the withdrawal season, usually accounting for 50%–80% of total gas; the latter is the volume of gas above the level of base gas, available to the marketplace. Here, monthly working gas is equal to the amount of working gas in the previous month plus the deposit amount of the current month, minus the gas extraction quantity. We then have 
where B stands for the percentage of base gas in total gas.
At each decision point, an investor has two alternatives, respectively immediate investment and delayed investment. By comparing the investment value of each decision point, the optimal timing can be found for investment to maximize the project value (Hach and Spinler, 2016; Pringles et al., 2015), the investment value of the project
can be written as following: where F is the investment value calculated with RO method, t is the optimal timing to invest during the valid investment period. 3.2. Uncertainties
Gas storage facilities investment may be affected by a variety of uncertain factors such as gas demand, gas production, investment cost and OMC. The gap between natural gas demand and production is the key driver influencing the value of gas storage, especially under market-based storage price mechanism. In addition, investment cost and OMC may be considered as uncertain technological factors, which will gradually decrease with the technology progressing. The comparison between OMC and a referenced OMC determines whether to give a subsidy for gas storage. Fig. 1 provides a summary of key tech- nologies of underground gas storage facilities construction, including geologic evaluation and gas reservoir engineering, drilling and comple- tion engineering and injection and gas recovery engineering. China's gas/oil reservoirs are generally buried in the ground 3000 m below, greatly increasing the difficulty of exploration and investment cost. More reasonable leakage and stability test, drilling system and well cas- ing program, as well as cementing and completion technology, will re- duce investment cost significantly. Furthermore, China's underground gas storage is faced with challenges in improving single well production capacity and gas injection/production ratio. Through optimizing gas injection/withdrawal process, tube structure, and wellhead equipment, gas injection/withdrawal capacity will be raised and OMC will be reduced.
Stochastic process is an appropriate technique widely used for describing the uncertain factors. In RO theory, there are two kinds of stochastic process to depict uncertain factors, including GBM and mean reverting process. Previous studies have used the GBM to describe the motion process for prices and technological development (Siddiqui et al., 2007; Pringles et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). The GBM model has also been used to represent future demand and supply (Bean et al., 1992; Ryan, 2004; Manuel and Jose, 2014). In this paper, we also employ the GBM to characterize the uncertainties in market and technological development. Here, we use modified GBM to simulate natural gas demand considering seasonal effects (Pless et al., 2016). Then we can get: where Xt is represented as a stochastic variable, α is the drift rate of the
S. Chen et al. / Energy Economics 70 (2018) 132–142 135  variable, σ is the volatility or standard deviation. Finally, dz is a Wiener process, and z 1⁄4 ε dt , where ε is subjected to standard normal distribution, namely ε ~ N(0, 1). When the gas production is considered, let St denotes gas production, αS and σS represent the drift rate and vol- atility parameter of the gas production, respectively. When the invest- ment cost is concerned, let ICt denotes the unit investment cost in time t, αI and σI respectively stand for the drift rate and volatility param- eter of the investment cost. When the variable cost is concerned, let Vt denotes the unit variable cost in time t, αV and σV respectively represent the drift rate and volatility parameter of the variable cost. Here, variable cost is OMC. In addition, Dt denotes the gas demand in time t, αD and σD respectively stand for the drift rate and volatility parameter of the de- mand, tmax strands for the peak demand season, and β is a seasonal ef- fect parameter.
3.3. Characterization of related policies 
3.3.1. Gas market reform
The governmental supporting policies for gas storage developing comprise gas market reform and subsidy. In China, gas market has been strictly regulated by government, without independent and transparent storage price mechanism. At the end of 2016, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that it would carry out gas market reform, allowing the implementation of the market-based storage price. However, actually it still has a long run to accomplish gas market reform due to the time lagging effect. With more time and resources input, the greater the probability of reform success will be. Assuming that the gas market reform won't be carried out until the year ts, and the probability of the reform succeeded is related to time t, mathematically, it can be expressed as: where Prt, i is the possibility of the success of gas market reform in the mouth of the year t.If the market reform is failed, regulated storage fee is adopted, expressed as pr. China's gas storage prices are not independently accounted, leading to that there is no data to estimate pr. Here, pr is de- termined by referring to regulated gas storage price in European coun- tries, such as Spain and Italy, as shown in formula (12): where Pr is the reference regulated gas storage price, calculated based on average regulated storage price of Spain, Italy, Belgium and so on. In general, the regulated gas storage price is set according to costs. Considering differences in investment cost between China and European countries, we set an adjustment coefficient εr to enable the price to cover costs.
When the market reform is successful, storage fee will change with changes in natural gas demand and supply, rather than controlled by government. The gas storage is usually used to meet peak demand of natural gas. When the gap between peak demand for natural gas and gas production capacity is bigger, the value of gas storage is greater and storage price will be raised. Thus, the storage price can be expressed as a function of gas demand and production like ptðDt−1;p;St−1Þ. Suppose that the storage price is subjected to following formula: 
where pt is the market-based storage price in time t, p represents the intrinsic value of gas storage that unaffected by fluctuations of gas supply and demand in the short term, namely, long-term average storage price, calculated based on average gas storage price in Holland, Denmark, Czech Republic, Britain, and Slovakia. China's gas storage resources are scarcer than in Europe, as well as the gap between gas demand and supply in China is more obvious, so the intrinsic value of gas storage should be higher. We set a coefficient εm to adjust the p. Here, εm is given by dividing the percentage of total underground gas storage capacity in natural gas consumption in Europe by that in China. Dt − 1, p is peak demand for natural gas in time (t − 1), and St−1 denotes average monthly gas production in the time (t − 1). Moreover, λ is the sensitivity coefficients of pt to the difference between the peak
demand and gas production. When Dt−1;p−St−1 →1, the difference be- Dt−1;p
tween market demand and production increase by x%, the gas storage price will increase by λx%.
According to classic economics theory, in the case of perfect compe- tition, one of the prerequisites of a continuous business is its variable cost less than market price, thus gas storage will keep operating only when gas storage price is greater than the variable cost. Then we can get: where vct is the variable cost, including ivt and wvt. In summary, the
market-based gas storage service price can be represented as: 
3.3.2. Subsidy policy
Subsidy is one of the most effective instruments used by government to promote infrastructure development. One of the major reasons for the lagged development of China's gas storage facilities is high invest- ment costs compared with other investment projects. So in order to at- tract more investors, we give subsidy on the basis of the total storage capacity, as shown in formula (15):
Subt 1⁄4 subt  C ð16Þ
where subt represents the subsidy per storage capacity, and Subt is total subsidy. In addition, the subsidy is given to investors at the beginning of the year as the underground gas storage completed.
A phase-out mechanism of subsidy is adopted in the long run because the subsidy would be reduced with technical progress and the perfection of market system (Kumbaroglu et al., 2008). In this paper we assume that the subsidy is adjusted based on the change of 3.4. Solutions
As shown in Fig. 2, the detailed solution procedure can be conducted in six steps. The first step is to initialize M and N, which respectively denote the number of simulation paths and decision points. The second step is to estimate uncertain factors based on the GBM and scenario analysis. The third step is to calculate net present value of the project at each decision point for each path i as show in Eqs. (1) to (6), based on simulated uncertain factors, and to find the optimal decision be- tween investing immediately and waiting, at each decision point for any path i, by comparing expected net present value of these two choices, we can obtain following determination condition: where Γt, i = 0 and Γt, i = 1 respectively denote delayed and immediate investment.
The fourth step is to find out the optimal invest timing and corre- sponding investment value for each path i. The optimal invest timing is chosen from decision nod whose optimal decision is immediate invest, which is given by: where topt, i denotes to the optimal investment timing for the simulated path i, and T is represented as a set of all decision nods whose optimal 
decision is to immediately invest. By the way, investing gas storage is an unadvisable choice if T is a null set.
The final step is find out the optimal invest timing with highest frequency, and calculate expected investment value over all paths, as given by: where Fre(t) stands for the frequency of t being the optimal investment timing over all paths. 
4. Data and results
4.1. Parameter estimation
This section shows the parameters used in our study which are mainly collected or compiled from governmental documents and previ- ous studies, as shown in Table 2. We provide detailed descriptions on the determination of some key parameters.
4.1.1. Natural gas demand and production
Based on historical data of gas demand and production published by National Bureau of Statistics of China and Wind Database, future gas demand and production are simulated, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The drift rate and volatility rate of China's natural gas demand are 1.78% and 12.98%, respectively. Moreover, the drift rate and volatility rate of the natural gas production are 0.81% and 3.67%. Considering China en- tering new normal economy, in which China's economic growth rate has fallen below 7% since 2015 and will maintain it for a long time, as 
well as China's promise of natural gas development in INDC, the param- eters related to natural gas demand and production simulation are ad- justed, and the details are listed in Table 1. The adjusted parameters are determined based on predictions of International Energy Agency (IEA) that natural gas demand and production will respectively reach 482 billion cubic meters and 261 billion cubic meters. After adjustment, we estimate that Chinese natural gas demand and production are pre- dicted to 464 billion cubic meters and 251 billion cubic meters by 2030, respectively.
4.1.2. Investment cost
With the improvement of gas leakage and stability test, drilling fluid and spacer fluid, the cementing quality is improved and the investment cost of gas storage facilities is declined. Unit investment cost of under- ground gas storage established from depleted natural gas or oil fields is 3.5–4.5 RMB/m3 in China (Yao et al., 2016). Considering China's de- pleted natural gas or oil fields having the characteristics of complicated geologic structure, deep burial and poor physical property, we assume that the drift rate of China's unit gas storage investment cost is 0.05. The estimated trend of unit cost of investment is illustrated in Fig. 5. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate effects of different levels of technological improvements and learning effect on underground gas storage investment strategy. 
4.1.3. Operation and management cost
In this study, OMC is composed of two parts, injection cost and withdraw cost. These two kinds of cost are closely related to gas injec- tion and gas recovery engineering, and they are roughly the same in most cases such as Columbia pipeline company in USA. Therefore, we assume that they are equal and will decline with technology improve- ment. Future injection cost and withdraw cost are simulated as shown in Fig. 6. Volatility in operation and management cost is obvious because of the great uncertainty in labour costs and maintenance costs caused by equipment aging in the future.
4.1.4. Storage price
With the gas market reform, the price of gas storage is closely related to the market demand and supply of natural gas, rather than set by the government. Referred to benchmark storage price of Europe and America (Hu et al., 2010), we assume that the sensitivity coefficient of storage service price to the market is between 0 and 1. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted in this study to investigate effect of the sensi- tivity coefficient on gas storage investment. Gas injection and withdraw price are considered to have little to do with the market in this paper, thus, they are assumed as constants. The simulated storage price in the market reform scenario is shown in Fig. 7.
4.2. Main results
The investment strategies for gas storage in China are examined in this section. Because gas market reform just started, the impacts of the new policy on domestic gas storage facilities development are un- known, so we have also investigated the potential effects of gas market reform on the optimal investment strategy (investment timing and value). At first, it is necessary to examine the robustness of the model to the number of simulation paths (Zhang et al., 2016). Fig. 8 illustrates the statistical convergence of investment value depending on the number of simulation paths. It can be observed that the solution is robust for a number of simulations of 10,000 times.
The comparison between gas storage price with and without reform, and the comparison between the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and RO method are shown in Table 3. Without considering gas market reform, the investment value calculated by DCF method is negative, and the optimal investment strategy is to abandon this project. When RO method is utilised, optimal investment timing is the year 2030, and the investment value becomes 0.05 RMB/m3. These may help ex- plain why the underground gas storage in China has not rapidly developed from an investment perspective. When gas market reform is considered, the investment value increases no matter which method is used. However, the investment value based on the DCF method is still negative, which means immediate investment in this project is unprofitable. Using the RO method, however, the investment value is 0.33 RMB/m3 and the optimal investment time is the year 2026. Comparing the results with and without gas market reform, we can find the implementation of gas market reform greatly influences the investment strategy, including the investment value and optimal investment timing. The value that gas market reform brings to investors is 0.60 RMB/m3 and 0.28 RMB/m3 respectively by using the DCF method and RO method. Additionally, the value of the option to defer is 0.80 RMB/m3 and 1.12 RMB/m3 respectively in the scenarios with/ without considering gas market reform, both greater than zero. This indicates that whether or not to consider gas market reform, it is always worthwhile for investors to wait for a better time. To sum up, we find that gas market reform has a positive impact on the investment value and optimal investment timing.
4.3. Sensitivity analysis
4.3.1. Subsidy
As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, we can find that whether or not to consider gas market reform, the subsidy always has a positive effect on optimal investment timing and investment value. When considering the gas market reform, the best investment timing can be brought for- ward to the year 2024 as the subsidy raises from 0 to 1.5 RMB/m3, meanwhile, the investment value increases to 0.71 RMB/m3. In the scenario without gas market reform, the best investment timing is advanced to 2026, and the investment value has increased from 0.05 to 0.28 RMB/m3. Figs. 9 and 10 prove that to make investors invest underground gas storage facilities earlier, the government should properly increase the subsidy level. Of course, the subsidy couldn't be increased too high to avoid the over-loaded government's fiscal expen- diture. Furthermore, through comparing these two scenarios, we can find that implementing gas market reform has the same effect as giving a subsidy of 1.5 RMB/m3 from the aspect of optimal investment timing, and it has a better effect on the investment value. As a result, it is sug- gested that the government should take market instruments to promote underground gas storage development.
4.3.2. Investment cost
High investment cost is one of the main reasons that hinder the development of gas storage facilities in China. Figs. 11 and 12 show how the investment value and optimal investment timing vary with the change of drift rate of unit investment cost. Investment cost is closely re- lated to technology. Generally, technology is always progressing and upgrading, resulting in a lower investment cost, thus the drift rate of in- vestment is minus. In this study, we use absolute value of the drift rate to measure technological improvements.
As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, only when the drift rate of investment cost is at least 2%, investors won't abandon this project in the scenario with gas market reform. With the drift rate increasing from 2% to 15%, the optimal investment timing is brought forward to 2023 from 2030. In addition, the optimal strategy is always to abandon this investment in the scenario without considering gas market reform until the drift rate raises to 5%. As the drift rate grows from 5% to 15%, the optimal investment timing is brought forward to 2027. In terms of investment value, it increases from 0.11 RMB/m3 to 0.82 RMB/m3, at an average rate of 15.51% with the increase of the drift rate in the scenario of gas market reform, lower than 19.11% in the scenario of without gas market reform. Obviously, the technological improvement is helpful to increase investment value and bring forward the optimal investment timing. However, it is also easy to find that only prominent technological improvements can attract earlier investment in the scenario without considering gas market reform. Thus, only relying on technological improvements to promote the development of gas storage is not an effective method. It is supposed to establish an open natural gas market and promote technological innovation simultaneously.
4.3.3. Sensitivity coefficient of storage price
In the scenario of gas market reform implementation, a sensitivity
analysis of sensitivity coefficient of storage price to market is made. Fig. 13 shows effects of the sensitivity coefficient on the optimal invest- ment timing and investment value. The results show that higher sensi- tivity coefficient can make a higher investment value and an earlier 
optimal investment timing. It can be seen from Fig. 13 that when sensi- tivity coefficient of gas storage price increases to 1.0, the investment value increases from 0.10 RMB/m3 to 0.83 RMB/m3, and the optimal investment timing is shifted to the year 2024 from 2030. Thus, the sensitivity coefficient of storage price is positively related to investment value and investment timing. This means that gas storage service price is more sensitive to the market which causes higher investment value and earlier investment opportunity. Therefore, besides implementing natural gas market reform as soon as possible, the government should take effective measures to increase the sensitivity of gas storage price, such as appropriately pushing a coal-to-gas switch to increasing the rigid demand of natural gas.
4.3.4. Lagged time of gas market reform
Considering time lagging effect of gas market reform, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of lagged time on the optimal investment strategy. As shown in Fig. 14, delays in natural gas market reform will have a negative impact on investors' investment strategies, which will delay the optimal investment opportunities and reduce the investment value of the projects. In detail, as the lagged time of gas market reform deferred from 2020 to 2060, the optimal investment timing is gradually deferred from the year 2026 to the year 2030. Moreover, the investment value is reduced from 0.33 RMB/m3 to the 0.25 RMB/m3. From above results, we can conclude that implementing gas market reform earlier can attract more investors to invest earlier, but it has limited positive effect on investment timing due to high investment cost. This is why even if the gas reform is advanced by 2020, the optimal investment timing is not advanced. The results once again prove that gas market reform and the promotion of technological innovation should be carried out simultaneously. 
5. Conclusions
Underground gas storage facilities have been considered as the most important facility for absorbing seasonal gas supply-demand fluctua- tions. Inadequate gas storage capacity has been identified as the most serious reason for hindering gas market development in China. Attracting underground gas storage investment plays an important role in meeting gas on-peak demand and promoting gas supply security. Therefore, a real option model is proposed to evaluate underground gas storage facilities investment and find out the optimal investment strat- egy. In addition, uncertainties in gas market, governmental incentives and technological improvements are all considered.
In the process of assessment on underground gas storage facilities investment, two scenarios are proposed according to whether or not to take gas market reform into consideration, reflecting potential influ- ences of natural gas marketization on the optimal investment timing and investment value. In addition, a phase-out mechanism of subsidy is considered to reflect the long term change of timing and strength of policy support. The obtained conclusions include, (i) firstly, value of implementing gas market reform is 0.60 RMB/m3 and 0.28 RMB/m3 respectively by using the DCF method and RO method; (ii) secondly, value of option to defer is 0.80 RMB/m3 and 1.12 RMB/m3 respectively in the scenarios with and without gas market reform; (iii) thirdly, when gas market reform is executed, the investment value tends to increase substantially, and the optimal investment timing could also be shifted to an earlier year of 2026, compared to the case of without gas market reform; (iv) fourthly, carrying out a proper subsidy, promoting technological improvements and implementing gas market reform as early as possible can attract the earlier investment, as well as implementing gas market reform has a more positive effect on inves- tors' investment strategy compared to giving a subsidy of 1.5 RMB/m3. These results have several important policy implications, (i) firstly, implementation of gas market reform has a positive effect on
underground gas storage facilities investment, government is supposed to further promote gas market reform in China, formulating supporting laws and regulations; (ii) secondly, Chinese government can give inves- tors proper subsidy so that the earlier investment becomes the optimal strategy for these investors; (iii) finally, Chinese government should take a variety of measures, e.g. increasing the expenditure on technol- ogy research and development, establishing investment insurance mechanism to reduce risks, strengthening government regulations based on market mechanism, and enhancing international cooperation, to carry out orderly gas market reform and technological improvements simultaneously.
Although our proposed model considers the actual situations in China as much as possible, it inevitably has some limitations in view of the complexity of underground gas storage facilities investment. Firstly, there could be other influencing factors which are not consid- ered in our study, such as geological characteristics. Secondly, the rela- tionship between storage price and gas demand is based on our hypothesis. Thirdly, due to the limitation of data, we only use GBM to describe uncertain factors which may be insufficient. The accurate values of drift rate and volatility rate are also difficult to be estimated. Further researches could be carried out to improve the evaluation model by addressing these limitations.

22,"Is China's electricity price cross-subsidy policy reasonable? Comparative analysis of eastern, central, and western regions","Proper handling of the electricity price cross-subsidy is the key to reducing the power cost of industrial and commercial users and is also the key task of China's new round of power system reform. First, this paper analyzes the development history of China's electricity price policy and describes the problems faced by the government at different stages. Second, a cross-subsidy calculation model is established, and a method for calculating the scale and degree of cross-subsidy is proposed. Third, the concept of reasonable cross-subsidy is defined, and a method for calculating the reasonable cross-subsidy ratio is proposed. Finally, Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are selected as representatives of the eastern, central, and western regions of China to analyze whether the current China cross-subsidy policy is reasonable. The results show that, compared with the economically underdeveloped provinces of Henan and Qinghai, in Jiangsu province, where the economy is more developed, the residential and agricultural users have higher levels of cross-subsidy, but the ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy is lower. This shows that there is an unreasonable situation in China's electricity price cross-subsidy policy.","Introduction In the past few decades, China’s economy has been developing rapidly, however, China is still a developing country with low per capita disposable income, and basic agricultural production needs government support. Therefore, to achieve a universal electricity service and guar- antee basic agricultural production activities, the government has implemented a cross-subsidy policy for electricity prices in the long- term. Industrial and commercial users subsidize the electricity price for residential users and agricultural users to ensure that the electricity prices of residential and agricultural users are kept at a low level. In 2018, China’s total electricity consumption was 6844.9 billion kW⋅h, an increase of 8.5% compared to the previous year (National Energy Administration, 2019). The huge electricity consumption is accompa- nied by a similarly huge scale of cross-subsidy. Reasonable cross-subsidy will help in achieving a universal electricity service, guarantee basic agricultural production, and facilitate China’s macroeconomic regula- tion and control. However, excessive cross-subsidy is not conducive to industrial restructuring, and hinders both economic and social development. In 2015, the “Several Opinions on Further Deepening the Reform of the Power System”, promulgated by the State Council of China, pointed out that “the orderly promotion of electricity price reform, the ration- alization of the electricity price formation mechanism, and the proper handling of cross-subsidy are the key tasks of the power system reform.” From this, it can be seen that accurately accounting for the scale and the degree of China’s cross-subsidy and analyzing the rationality of cross- subsidy, are of great significance for properly handling the cross- subsidy and reducing the power costs for industrial and commercial users. In addition, China has an imbalance in regional economic devel- opment. Compared with the eastern coastal areas, the economic devel- opment in the central and western regions is relatively backward. Residential users and agricultural users in different economic develop- ment areas have different levels of demand for cross-subsidy. Therefore, the issue of whether the current China electricity price cross-subsidy policy is reasonable requires a comparative analysis between different regions.
Electricity price cross-subsidy is a form of energy subsidy. Energy subsidies include fossil fuel subsidies (Dennis, 2016; Liu and Li, 2011, Erickson et al., 2017), electricity price subsidies (Chattopadhyay, 2007), and heating subsidies (Pu et al., 2019). Energy subsidies are a common worldwide phenomenon (Iriani and Trabelsi, 2015). In Indonesia, the large-scale of the sales’ price subsidy has become a huge burden for the government. Study shows that the elimination of subsidies helps guide users to save energy and improve electricity efficiency (Burke and Kurniawati, 2018). In India, energy subsidy reforms have led to an in- crease in general price levels, which have had a negative impact on socially relevant welfare (Acharya and Sadath, 2017). In Ghana, fuel subsidies benefit the wealthy more than they do the poor, and study shows that the elimination of fuel subsidies in Ghana will have a serious negative impact on household welfare for poor groups, leading to a 1.5% increase in poverty (Cooke et al., 2014). In China, oil product subsidies have the greatest impact on consumers, which is followed by electricity subsidies and coal subsidies. Study shows that the Chinese government’s macro-control of prices can help alleviate the negative impact of energy subsidy reform (Jiang et al., 2015).
Electricity price cross-subsidies include the following three types: 1) other social industries subsidize electricity prices to agricultural users. The results of study show that the elimination of the cross-subsidy will increase inflation and reduce the income of rural households (Bhatta- charyya and Ganguly, 2017). 2) Public utilities subsidize electricity prices to residential users. However, in the face of fiscal deficits, the quality of services provided by public utilities to residential users who are subsidized has declined (Li et al., 2018). 3) Industrial users subsidize electricity prices to residential users. Through electricity market reform, industrial users can reduce the cross-subsidy of electricity prices for residential users (Erdogdu, 2011). In summary, although the current research involves cross-subsidy of electricity prices between different users, we could not find any work that analyzes the extent and ratio- nality of cross-subsidy.
Compared with the existing research, the innovations of the paper lie in the following: 1) theoretically — putting forward the concept of reasonable cross-subsidy, which should be able to balance the basic power services, promote economic development, and ensure environ- mentally sustainable development; 2) technically — establishing a model for calculating electricity price cross-subsidy, and calculating the scale and extent of cross-subsidy for residential users and agricultural users; 3) in practice, by applying the presented theories and models, considering the differences between regions, analyzing whether China’s electricity price cross-subsidy policy is reasonable.
The rest of this manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, the development of China’s electricity price policy is introduced. In Section 3, the model for calculating cross-subsidy is established, and the method for calculating the scale and degree of cross-subsidy is proposed. In Section 4, the concept of a reasonable cross-subsidy is defined, and a method for calculating a reasonable cross-subsidy scale is proposed. In Section 5, Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are selected as rep- resentatives of the eastern, central, and western regions of China, respectively, to analyze whether the current cross-subsidy policy in China is reasonable. Section 6 highlights the main conclusions of the paper, and presents a proposal for the current cross-subsidy policy. 2. Development history of China’s electricity price policy
Since the reform and opening up, China’s electricity price has gone through five stages: full control price, repayment of principal and in- terest price, operation price, benchmark price, and transmission and distribution price, as shown in Fig. 1.
With the solution of the contradiction between supply and demand, the problem of industrial and commercial users subsidizing residential users and agricultural users has become increasingly prominent, and it has become the key to reduce the power costs of industrial and com- mercial users.
2.1. Full control price (1978–1984)
In 1978, China began to implement the policy of reform and opening up. At this time, China’s power industry was in a period of fully- regulated pricing. Power generation, transmission, distribution, and electricity sales were all unified, the power equipment was backward, the quality and reliability of power were poor, there was a shortage of funds for power infrastructure construction, and the country’s power shortage was serious.
To solve the above problems, the Chinese government continued to promote the structural reform of electricity prices on the basis of maintaining a stable overall price level. The main measures included: 1) introducing the two-part electricity price that is used widely interna- tionally to encourage power users to improve electricity efficiency. 2) Promoting electricity meters with time-sharing functions, and imple- menting peak-to-valley prices and seasonal prices in pilot areas to pro- mote peak load shifting. These measures improved the efficiency of power generation and electricity consumption to a certain extent, increased the economic benefits of the power industry, and promoted the economic development of Chinese society in the early stage of re- form and opening up.
2.2. Repayment of principal and interest price (1985–1996)
In the mid-1980s, China’s economy developed rapidly, and the power supply could not meet the needs of economic and social devel- opment. During this period, the policy orientation shifted to encourage investment and guarantee demand. In 1985, the State Council of China promulgated “Interim Provisions on Encouraging Fund-raising and Power Generation and Implementing Multiple Electricity Prices”, allowing and encouraging multi-channel fund-raising to build power plants. To mobilize the participation and enthusiasm of social capital, repayment of capital and interest was introduced into the electricity price structure, that is, power plants that did not rely on government financial allocation determined the electricity price according to the repayment of principal and interest of the power plant and the approved income level.
Compared with 1984, China’s power generation capacity increased by 2.92 times in 1996, and power generation increased by 2.76 times. The repayment of principal and interest policy promoted the develop- ment of China’s power industry and eased the contradiction between supply and demand. In addition, the implementation of the “Electricity Law” in 1996 marked the entry of China’s electricity price management into the legalization track.
2.3. Operation price (1997–2001)
In 1997, the Asian financial crisis broke out, affecting the speed of economic development in Asian countries. However, it had somewhat eased the contradiction between China’s domestic electricity supply and demand. With the easing of the contradiction between power supply and demand, the drawbacks of the repayment of principal and interest policy had emerged gradually. Included: 1) leading power companies lack the external pressure to reduce costs and the internal motivation to improve efficiency; 2) the policy was not conducive to the rational layout of the power industry; and 3) the policy leaded to an increase in sales’ price.
For the above reasons, the direction of China’s electricity price policy had also been changed to avoid excessive price increases and expand demand. The main measures included: 1) the power generation side had released the operation price, replacing the repayment of principal and interest price; 2) funds and other fees charged by the governments at all levels had been cancelled; 3) a unified sales price and standardized electricity price management had been promoted; 4) rural users and urban users were being required to share the operating costs of rural power grids, and reduced the economic burden of rural users; and 5) price levers were being used to regulate electricity supply and demand.
2.4. Benchmark price (2002–2014)
In 2002, the State Council of China promulgated the “Power System Reform Plan”, and the power industry realized the separation of plants and the grid. In the same year, the electricity price reform team was established to conduct research into the UK and the Nordic electricity markets, and, considering China’s domestic bidding pilot areas, a pre- liminary electricity price reform program was formed. In 2004, the National Development and Reform Commission of China promulgated the “Interim Measures for the Administration of feed-in Electricity Prices”, the “Interim Measures for the Administration of Transmission and Distribution Price”, and the “Interim Measures for the Adminis- tration of Sales Electricity Prices”, which became the cornerstone of electricity price reform. In 2005, the State Council of China officially promulgated the “Measures for Electricity Price Reform”. The core of this policy was to change the feed-in electricity price mechanism of coal- fired units from an ex-post electricity price to a pre-approved benchmark electricity price, which significantly improved the efficiency of invest- ment. At the same time, the promotion of benchmark electricity prices to wind power, photovoltaic power generation, nuclear power, and biomass power generation was of great significance for promoting the development of clean energy.
During the benchmark price period, the problem of cross-subsidy between different users gradually became prominent. Cross-subsidy re- fers to the pricing method in which a company’s pricing of a commodity is either lower than its marginal cost or higher than its total cost (Faulhaber, 1975). Cross-subsidy of residential users and agricultural users shared with industrial and commercial users distort the price severely, leading to the failure of the price mechanism to allocate re- sources. The sales’ price cannot reflect the relationship between power supply and demand, at the same time, the power intensity is high, which is not conducive to energy conservation and emissions’ reduction and has a negative impact on the development of Chinese society.
2.5. Transmission and distribution price (2015–present)
In 2015, the State Council of China promulgated the “Several
Opinions on Further Deepening the Reform of the Power System”, which marked the beginning of a new round of power reform in China. The core of this power reform is transmission and distribution price (T&D price) and the reduction of power costs. Since 2015, the new round of power reform has achieved the following goals: 1) forming a complete T&D price system. China’s 34 provincial-level administrative regions have successively announced the T&D price of industrial and commercial users in 2017–2019, which indicates that the profit mode of the grid companies has changed from the purchase-sale spread to the T&D price. 2) Releasing the generation price and the selling price, which promoted the rapid conversion of government pricing to market pricing and fostered the optimal allocation of power resources. 3) Meeting economic and social power demand at a lower price level. According to statistics, since 2016, the government has reduced the annual power cost by more than 43.8 billion dollars (1 CNY 1⁄4 0.146 USD) through price reduction, tax reduction, and marketization, which has reduced the electricity price burden of small and medium-sized enterprises, improved the business environment, and promoted the development of society.
The open and transparent T&D price system is the basis for calcu- lating the scale and degree of cross-subsidy. Properly handling the problem of industrial and commercial users subsidizing residential users and agricultural users is the key to reducing the power cost for industrial and commercial use.
3. Electricity price cross-subsidy calculation model
The sales’ price is mainly composed of the feed-in price and the T&D price, since different types of users pay the same feed-in price, therefore, industrial and commercial users subsidizing residential users and agri- cultural users is achieved essentially through the T&D price.
The research contents of this section are as follows: 1) establishing the cost calculation model and the cost allocation model of the T&D grid, calculating the T&D grid cost that power users of each voltage level need to bear. 2) According to the load simultaneity between different types of users of the same voltage level, calculating the theoretical T&D price of residential users and agricultural users. 3) The sum of the feed-in price and the theoretical T&D price is the theoretical price. According to the difference between the theoretical price and the sales’ price, the degree and total amount of cross-subsidy for the residential and agricultural users are determined. 3.1. Cost calculation of T&D grid
The cost of T&D grid includes depreciation fee, maintenance fee and the revenue of grid enterprise, which can be expressed as follows: where Ct;m, Ct;m, Ct;m represent the cost, the depreciation fee, and the maintenance fee of T&D grid at the voltage level m in year t. Mainte- nance fees mainly include material costs, repair costs and employee salaries, etc. αt represents the return on investment of T&D grid in year t. CDt;m and CMt;m can be expressed as follows: where NVt;m represents the net value of fixed assets of T&D grid at the voltage level m in the end of year t, fixed assets include transformers, lines, electricity metering equipment, communication device, automa- tion control equipment and land, etc. βt represents the depreciation rate in year t. γt represents the maintenance rate in year t. 3.2. Cost sharing of the T&D grid
According to the voltage level of the T&D grid, the T&D cost is apportioned, and the costs paid by users of each voltage level is calcu- lated. Users of different voltage levels utilize the T&D grid to different degrees. Therefore, to ensure the fairness and rationality of the cost allocation process, the users of the low-voltage T&D grid not only need to bear the cost of this voltage level but also need to share part of the cost of the high-voltage T&D grid. The costs paid by users in year t can be expressed as follows: m in year t, and Ct;l􏰀 m represents the cost of the voltage class l shared by
the users at the voltage level m in year t. Ct;m􏰀 n has a similar meaning to Ct;l􏰀 m. Lt;l represents the total load transmitted by the T&D grid with a voltage rating of m in year t. Lt;m has a meaning similar to Lt;l. Lt;l􏰀 m represents the load transmitted by the T&D grid with voltage class l to m in year t. Lt;m􏰀 n has a meaning similar to Lt;l􏰀 m.
3.3. Theoretical T&D price and theoretical price calculation for residential users and agricultural users According to the load simultaneity between different types of users of the same voltage level, the cost of the same voltage level is shared among residential users, agricultural users, general industrial and commercial users, and large industrial users, and the theoretical T&D price is calculated. Residential users and agricultural users implement the one-part rate system, which can be expressed as follows: The sales’ price is composed mainly of the feed-in price and the T&D price. Therefore, the theoretical price of residential users and agricul- tural users can be expressed as follows: Drawing on the spread method proposed by the IEA (Lin and Jiang, 2011), the sales’ price of residential users and agricultural users is used as the benchmark price in calculating the scale of cross-subsidy, which can be expressed as follows:
and agricultural users with a voltage level of m in year t. pt;m represents the sales’ price of the user X with a voltage level of m in year t. Further, according to the difference between the theoretical price and the sales’ price, the degree of cross-subsidy of the residential users and agricultural users is calculated separately; it can be expressed as follows:4. Is the cross-subsidy reasonable?
4.1. The concept of reasonable cross-subsidy
From the above discussion, the electricity price cross-subsidy is the product of the difference between theoretical price and sales’ price and electricity consumption, but not all cross-subsidies are reasonable; that is, there is a partial cross-subsidy that is invalid. A reasonable cross- subsidy should be able to balance the basic power services, promoting economic development and ensuring environmentally sustainable development.
Due to the difference in the level of economic development and the amount of energy resources, there are differences in the targets of different regions. For example, relatively backward regions will focus on achieving basic power services and promoting economic development, which is reflected in the reduction of electricity costs and environmental costs through cross-subsidy, whereas relatively developed regions are more focused on the sustainable development of environment and re- sources. The specific actions and goals are to carry out power reform, increase electricity costs and environmental costs, reduce and gradually eliminate cross-subsidies. Even in the same region, different stages of social development will focus on different goals. In fact, the cross- subsidy that the government can withdraw through reforms is basi- cally an unreasonable cross-subsidy. Therefore, the government’s power reform by reducing cross-subsidy is essentially reducing unreasonable cross-subsidy. Reducing cross-subsidy and guaranteeing reasonable cross-subsidy are not contradictory.
In summary, a reasonable cross-subsidy can be defined as the prod- uct of the difference between theoretical price and reasonable price and electricity consumption, which can balance basic power services, socio- economic development, and environmentally sustainable development. An unreasonable cross-subsidy is the product of the difference between reasonable price and sales’ price and electricity consumption, which usually only promotes one of the three objectives. The definition of reasonable cross-subsidy is shown in Fig. 2.
4.2. Method of calculation of reasonable cross-subsidy scale
According to the above, constructing a multi-objective optimization function with the goals of achieving a basic electricity service, pro- moting economic development, and ensuring environmentally sustain- able development, we can calculate an optimal price that balances the above three targets, that is, reasonable price. According to the reasonable price, a reasonable cross-subsidy scale can be calculated. However, since the objective function is difficult to quantify, and the constraints are difficult to select, determining a reasonable price is actually a very complicated process.
In this paper, the power conservation supply curve (Lin and Li, 2015) is used to convert the power balance into “supply þ power conservation 1⁄4 demand”. The optimal amount of power conservation obtained through the power conservation supply curve is the maximum amount of power conservation that can be obtained under the rational investment decision-making conditions; that is, under the condition of meeting so- cial power demand, the sustainable development of the environment can be guaranteed to the greatest extent. Therefore, with the amount of power conservation as a constraint, the calculated electricity price will at least meet the two goals of achieving a basic electricity service and ensuring sustainable development of the environment.
In addition, Lu (2011) and Chen (2010) proposed that power con- servation activities under rational investment decisions can promote economic development to a certain extent. Therefore, with the optimal amount of power conservation as a constraint, the calculated electricity price can balance the basic electricity service, promote economic development, and ensure the sustainable development of the environ- ment. This electricity price is a reasonable price. Further, a reasonable cross-subsidy scale can be calculated. The specific process is as follows:
(1) Calculating the power conservation cost according to the in- vestment amount of individual power conservation measures and the annual amount of power conservation, the power conserva- tion cost can be expressed as follows: conservation measure. Ik represents the total investment of the kth
power conservation measure. i represents the discount rate. TCE repre- kCE
sents the investment cycle of the kth power conservation measure. ΔQk represents the annual average amount of power conservation measure of the kth power conservation measure.
(2) In constructing the power conservation supply curve, the specific steps are as follows: the accumulated power conservation cost is the vertical axis, and the accumulated amount of power conser- vation is the horizontal axis. The power conservation measures are accumulated according to the cost from low to high, and the power conservation supply curve is constructed.
(3) Calculating the power supply cost in year t, the intersection point of the power supply cost curve and the power conservation supply curve is the optimal power conservation point, which corresponds to the optimal amount of power year t. For the convenience of calculation, the average sales’ price
in China is used to represent the power supply cost.
(4) Calculating the increase in sales’ price caused by power conser-
vation measures. Under the condition of the optimal amount of
power conservation, according to the price elasticity and the
sales’ price, the sales’ price increment Δpsale;X of the residential t;m
users and agricultural users due to power conservation is calcu- lated. Specifically, it can be expressed as follows: where X1⁄4R;A represent residential users and agricultural users, respectively; Cont represents the total amount of electricity consumption in year t. θXm represents the price elasticity of user X whose voltage level is m. The reasonable price of the residential and agricultural users preasonable;X can be expressed as follows: (5) Calculating the reasonable cross-subsidy scale for residential and agricultural users, which can be expressed as follows: represents the reasonable cross-subsidy scale for residential and agricultural users with a voltage level of m in year t. 5.1. Research object selection and basic data settings China can be divided geographically into the eastern region, the central region, and the western region. The economy of the eastern coastal region is relatively developed, whereas the economic develop- ment of the middle and western region, which are deep inland, are relatively backward.
Selecting average revenue from principal business of industrial en- terprises (Index 1), average cost from principal business of industrial enterprises (Index 2), average revenue from principal business of com- mercial enterprises (Index 3), average cost from principal business of commercial enterprises (Index 4), per capita annual disposable income (Index 5), per capita annual expenditures for consumption (Index 6), per capita gross output value of farming (Index 7) as the evaluation indicators.
According to the variation coefficient method, the weight of each indicator is set, the evaluation values for provinces in eastern, central and western regions are calculated. Index 1 and Index 2 reflect the operation of industrial enterprises. Index 3 and Index 4 reflect the operation of commercial enterprises. Index 5 and Index 6 reflect the living standards of residents. Index 7 reflects the agricultural develop- ment of each province. Therefore, the evaluation values calculated through the above indicators can fully reflect the economic situation of industry, commerce, residents and agriculture in each province.
The basic data of evaluation indicators are derived from the statis- tical yearbook of each province of China in 2018, the weights of eval- uation indicators are shown in Fig. 3, the evaluation values of provinces in the eastern, central and western regions are shown in Fig. 4.
As can be seen from Fig. 4, the evaluation values of Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai provinces are at the average level of the eastern, central and western regions. Therefore, Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai provinces are selected as typical provinces in the eastern, central and western regions of China, respectively, for analyzing whether China’s electricity price cross-subsidy is reasonable.
From spot investigation on the construction of the T&D grid and the growth of power consumption in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai prov- inces, at the end of 2018, the net value of fixed assets of the T&D grid is shown in Table 1, and the power consumption of different users is shown in Table 2. In addition, the return on investment α is set to 0.094 (Zheng, 2017). According to the actual situation of the grid enterprises, the depreciation rate β is set to 0.07. The maintenance rate γ is set to 0.1 (Han et al., 2011).
A total of 21 power conservation measures for the power industry are extracted from the “National Key Power Conservation Low-Carbon Technology Promotion Catalogue, Power Conservation Part” compiled by the National Development and Reform Commission in 2017 (National Development and Reform Commission, 2018), and the annual investment amount, the annual amount of power conservation, and the power conservation cost are shown in Table 3, with the power conser- vation measures being ranked from low to high according to the cost. The coal consumption rate is set to 308 g/kW⋅h (Kong et al., 2019), in which 1 tce 1⁄4 3.125 MW h. 5.2.1. Analysis of the degree of electricity price cross-subsidy
According to the net value of fixed assets of T&D grid (Table 1) and annual electricity consumption (Table 2) of Jiangsu, Henan, and Qing- hai provinces in 2018, calculating the theoretical T&D price of resi- dential and agricultural users. Considering the feed-in price, the theoretical price of residential users and agricultural users can be ob- tained, as shown in Table 4. The coal price, feed-in price and sales’ price for 2018 were obtained through investigation.
As shown in Table 4, the theoretical T&D price of residential and agricultural users of various voltage levels is highest in Jiangsu prov- ince, followed by Henan province in the central region and Qinghai province in the western region. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, the theoretical T&D price in Jiangsu province is 93.0128 $/MW⋅h, which is 1.36 times that of Henan province and 1.91 times that of Qinghai province. Jiangsu’s economy is relatively devel- oped, and the scale and speed of development of power grids are in the forefront of in China. The scale of fixed assets and annual investment of T&D grid is relatively large, which is the main reason for the higher theoretical T&D price. The feed-in price also reflects the economic level of Jiangsu province, which is in the eastern region of China, is relatively high.
Further observation of Table 4 shows that, in the same province, the theoretical T&D price of residential users of the same voltage level is higher than that of agricultural users. Taking Jiangsu province as an example, the theoretical T&D price of residential users with voltage levels of 1 kV and below is 93.0128 $/MW⋅h, which is 1.14 times that of agricultural users, mainly because the agricultural users have higher load rates than residential users, and the utilization of T&D grid by agricultural users is more than that by residential users.
The sum of the feed-in price and the theoretical T&D price is the theoretical price. As shown in Table 4, the theoretical price is consistent with the theoretical T&D price; that is, the highest is in Jiangsu province in the eastern region and the lowest is in Qinghai province in the western region.
According to the theoretical price and the sales’ price data in Table 4, we calculate the scale and degree of cross-subsidy of residential users and agricultural users in Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai provinces in 2018, as shown in Table 5.
As shown in Table 5, the scale of cross-subsidy received by resi- dential and agricultural users in Jiangsu province in 2018 is 3253.4 million dollars, which is 1.12 times and 23.82 times those of Henan province and Qinghai province, respectively. According to the survey data, the total electricity consumption of industrial users and commer- cial users in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces in 2018 was 396.71 billion kW⋅h, 197.83 billion kW⋅h, and 11.93 billion kW⋅h, respectively. Therefore, the average cross-subsidy for industrial and commercial users in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces was 8.2010 $/MW⋅h, 14.6838 $/MW⋅h, and 11.4501 $/MW⋅h, respectively. As can be seen, the cross- subsidy for industrial and commercial users in Henan and Qinghai provinces is higher than that for industrial and commercial users in Jiangsu province.
Due to the high level of economic development in the eastern region and a better business environment, resources from the central and western regions have flowed into the eastern region. Therefore, the technological innovation capability, human resources, and operating costs of industrial and commercial enterprises in the eastern region are better than those in the central and western regions. The high cross- subsidy will further weaken the market competitiveness of industrial and commercial enterprises in the central and western regions, thus hindering the economic development of the central and western regions.
Further observation of Table 5 shows that the cross-subsidy rate for residential and agricultural users in Jiangsu province was higher than those for residential and agricultural users in Henan and Qinghai provinces in 2018. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, the cross-subsidies of Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are 43.75%, 36.28%, and 39.73%, respectively. However, compared with residential and agricultural users in the more developed eastern regions, those in the central and western regions with lower average income levels need subsidies to guarantee normal living and agricultural production. The question of whether China’s electricity price cross- subsidy policy is reasonable requires further analysis.
5.2.2. Analysis of the rationality of the electricity price cross-subsidy
Referring to the research of Lin and Li (2015), based on the relevant data of 21 power conservation measures in the power industry in Table 3, we build China’s power conservation supply curve for 2018, as shown in Fig. 5. The partial map near the optimal power conservation point is shown in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 5, each node in China’s power conservation supply
curve represents a power conservation measure in the power industry, and the power conservation costs of various measures increase from left to right. The average sales’ price in China is calculated to be 98.2722 $/MW⋅h, that is, the power supply cost is 98.2722 $/MW⋅h. As shown in Fig. 6, the intersection of the power conservation supply curve and the power supply cost curve is the optimal power conservation point. Therefore, the optimal amount of power conservation in China’s power industry in 2018 is approximately 34.21 million MW⋅h. According to the electricity consumption of different regions, the optimal amount of power conservation in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces in 2018 are 7.97 million MW⋅h, 4.68 million MW⋅h, and 0.28 million MW⋅h, respectively.
Further, according to the optimal amount of power conservation, the electricity consumption, the sales’ price, and the price elasticity of different types of users in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces, the sales’ price increment is calculated to determine the reasonable price. The reasonable price of residential and agricultural users in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces in 2018 are shown in Table 6.
As shown in Table 6, since Jiangsu’s economic level and per capita income are higher than those of Henan and Qinghai provinces, the ab- solute value of the price elasticity of residential and agricultural users in Jiangsu province is lower than those of Henan and Qinghai provinces. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, the price elasticities of Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are 􏰀 0.096, 􏰀 0.191, and 􏰀 0.223, respectively. That is, compared with residential and agricultural users in Jiangsu province, residential and agricultural users in Henan and Qinghai provinces are more sensitive to sales’ prices. The impact of the cross-subsidy policy for the daily life of residents and the agricultural production activities of agricultural users in Henan and Qinghai provinces is even greater.
Further observation of Table 6 shows that the sales’ price increment in Jiangsu province is higher than that in Henan and Qinghai provinces. That is to say, the difference between the sales’ price and the reasonable price in Jiangsu province is more obvious now. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, the sales’ price increments in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are 15.6906 $/MW⋅h, 7.3566 $/MW⋅h, and 4.6301 $/MW⋅h, respectively. In addition, the reasonable price for different types of users is between the theoretical price and the sales’ price.
According to the relationship between the sales’ price, the reason- able price, and the theoretical price, the reasonable amounts and the unreasonable amounts of cross-subsidy in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces are determined. The ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces in 2018 is shown in Table 7.
As shown in Table 7, the ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy in Henan and Qinghai provinces, which are located in the central region and the western region, respectively, is higher in 2018 than that in Jiangsu province, which is in the eastern region. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, the scale of reasonable cross-subsidy in Jiangsu province is 1680.7 million dollars, the scale of unreasonable cross-subsidy is 527.7 million dollars, and the ratio of reasonable cross- subsidy is 76.11%. The ratios of reasonable cross-subsidy in Henan and Qinghai provinces are 83.59% and 87.86%, respectively. The initial purpose of the electricity price cross-subsidy policy is to: 1) realize a universal electricity service to meet the demands of low-income resi- dents, and 2) guarantee the development of basic agriculture and pro- mote the sustainable development of the national economy. However, in recent years, China’s economic level has increased significantly, and the disposable income of residential users and agricultural users has increased year by year. For some residents and agricultural users, the impact of electricity expenses on daily life and agricultural production activities is small, which is the main reason for the existence of an un- reasonable cross-subsidy.
Further observation of Table 7 shows that the unreasonable cross- subsidy for residential users is much higher than that for agricultural users. The scale of unreasonable cross-subsidy for residential users in Jiangsu province is 660.0 million dollars, which is 14.32 times that for agricultural users. The amount of unreasonable cross-subsidy for resi- dential users in Henan and Qinghai provinces is 20.70 times and 18.25 times that for agricultural users, respectively. The ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy for agricultural users of various voltage levels in Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces exceeds 90%.
In summary, compared with Jiangsu province in the eastern region, the cross-subsidies in Henan and Qinghai provinces, which are in the central region and the western region, respectively, are more reason- able. Within any given province, the cross-subsidy for agricultural users is more effective than that for residential users. According to the above discussion, the key task of the new round of power reform period is to gradually reduce the cross-subsidy and reduce the power cost, especially the power cost for industrial and commercial users. Therefore, by improving the sales’ price mechanism and the electricity price cross- subsidy policy, exiting the unreasonable cross-subsidy can be the first step to gradually reduce the cross-subsidy. 5.2.3. The impact of coal price on electricity price cross-subsidy
Coal price has a direct impact on feed-in price, which affects theo- retical price and sales’ price. Changes in sales’ price have led to changes in the electricity consumption of residential and agricultural users, and the scale of electricity price cross-subsidy has also changed. Taking residential users of 1 kV and below as an example, analyzing the impact of coal price changes on the scale of electricity price cross-subsidy in Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai provinces, as shown in Table 8.
As shown in Table 8, the electricity consumption of residential users is inversely proportional to the coal price. The theoretical price and the sales price are proportional to the coal price. As coal price falls, the scale of cross-subsidy gradually expands. When coal price falls by 40%, the scale of electricity price cross-subsidy in Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai provinces is 2236.4 million dollars, 2079.7 million dollars and 99.3 million dollars respectively, increasing by 1.27%, 2.65% and 3.77%. Compared with Jiangsu province, the scale of cross-subsidy in Henan and Qinghai provinces is more affected by coal price. Further, the impact of coal price changes on the ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy is analyzed, as shown in Table 9.
As shown in Table 9, as the coal price reduces, the power supply cost reduces, the optimal amount of power conservation increases, and the reasonable electricity price increases. When coal price falls by 40%, the ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy in Jiangsu, Henan and Qinghai prov- inces is 79.70%, 86.25% and 90.15% respectively, and the growth rate of reasonable cross-subsidy ratio is 4.72%, 3.17% and 2.61%. Therefore, the reduction in coal price can effectively improve the ratio of reason- able cross-subsidy.
6. Conclusion and policy implications
Properly handling the problem of industrial and commercial users subsidizing residential users and agricultural users is the key to solve China’s increasingly prominent cross-subsidy problem, and is also the basis for improving China’s electricity price system. This paper selects Jiangsu, Henan, and Qinghai provinces as typical provinces in eastern, central, and western regions of China, respectively. Based on the actual transmission and distribution costs of residential users and agricultural users, the scale of cross-subsidy in different regions is calculated. Further, the concept of reasonable price for residential users and agri- cultural users is defined, and the scale and ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy in different regions are analyzed. The results show that: compared with Henan and Qinghai provinces, which are economically underdeveloped, Jiangsu Province, where the economy is more devel- oped, has higher levels of cross-subsidy for residential and agricultural users, while the ratio of reasonable cross-subsidy is lower. This shows that there is an unreasonable situation in China’s electricity price cross- subsidy policy. In fact, China’s current electricity price cross-subsidy policy can effectively achieve a universal power service, but the role of supporting the country’s macroeconomic regulation and control and industrial structure adjustment is very limited, and the objective of obtaining the cross-subsidy needs further accurate identification. Based on the research content of this paper, the following policy recommen- dations are proposed.
(1) Strengthening government supervision of transmission and dis- tribution cost accounting. For a long time, the transmission and distribution costs for different types of users calculated by grid companies have not been consistent with the actual costs. The grid enterprises should calculate the actual transmission and distribution costs according to the degree of utilization of the grid resources by different types of users. Strengthening the govern- ment’s supervision of transmission and distribution cost ac- counting is conducive to accurately mastering the scale and degree of cross-subsidy in different provinces and provides an important basis for the government to improve the electricity price cross-subsidy policy.
(2) Identifying power users who really need cross-subsidy. According to the disposable income of residential users and agricultural users, the residential users and agricultural users are divided into high-income users, middle-income users, and low-income users. The government can either gradually reduce or cancel the cross- subsidy for high-income and middle-income residential users and agricultural users according to the economic development level and social development needs of different provinces. This will not only help the government to withdraw gradually from the un- reasonable cross-subsidy but it is also conducive to reducing the power costs of industrial and commercial users and promoting the adjustment of a regional industrial structure.
(3) Exploring the possibility of regional cross-subsidy. The cross- subsidies in the more-developed eastern regions are higher, and the ratios of reasonable cross-subsidy are lower. If the cross- subsidies that are withdrawn from various provinces are all used to reduce the electricity prices of local industrial and com- mercial users, this will further weaken the market competitive- ness of industrial and commercial users in the underdeveloped central and western regions, hindering the economic develop- ment of the central and western regions and increasing the eco- nomic gap between the central, western, and eastern regions. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the transfer of part of the cross-subsidy from the eastern region to the central and the western regions, which will reduce the power costs of industrial and commercial users in the central and the western region and help narrow the gap in economic levels between different regions of China. Meanwhile, the function of the electricity price cross- subsidy policy to assist China’s macroeconomic regulation and control will be realized.

23,"Market reform of Yunnan electricity in southwestern China: Practice, challenges and implications","This paper reviews the electricity market reforms improving resource allocation and renewable energy integration in Yunnan. Given the predominance of hydropower and the importance of energy exports in Yunnan, the province presents a challenging case study of electricity market reforms. The experience of and lessons from Yunnan provide a reference for other provinces in China engaged in the growing adoption of renewable energy. The main contributions of this paper lie in the extension of the existing understanding of electricity reforms in Yunnan and China. Based on extensive data previously unreported in the literature, this paper shows how the Yunnan electricity market functions in practice and indicates where the practice is deficient in terms of the theory of how electricity markets should function. Finally, this paper suggests how market reforms should be adopted toward a scientifically designed electricity market.","1. Introduction
In the past several decades of economic reform and “opening-up” [1,2], China has maintained vigorous economic growth and become the world’s second largest economy, contributing approximately one-third of global economic growth [3,4]. While the Chinese economy grows rapidly, a series of environmental problems and climate change issues have emerged [5–9], giving rise to challenges related to the transition of China’s current heavily coal-reliant electricity system to a cleaner energy system [10]. To comply with its commitments to reduce carbon emissions intensity by 40%–45% relative to 2005 and increase the share of non-fossil primary energy consumption to 15% by 2020 [11,12], China launched new reforms in 2015 for its coal-heavy electricity sector, detailed in a guiding document, “Opinions on Further Deepening the Power Sector Reform” (Document 9) [13]. Document 9 called for a transition to a clean, competitive electricity power system based on strict grid asset regulation, non-discrimination, and open access for power sellers and buyers. In a path to market liberalization seen in a number of countries [14], following the unbundling of transmission and distribution prices, China’s nationwide industrial electricity pricing changed from regulated to market pricing, the distribution and retail aspects of the industry were opened to the private sector, and govern- ment quotas (electricity generation and consumption plans) are gra- dually abolished. The power trading business was broken off from the grid companies and transferred to newly established power exchanges. However, electricity is distinctive as a commodity [15], and, therefore, electricity markets must be different from other commodity markets [16]. The need for instantaneous power balancing implies that an electricity market simultaneously involves the processes of generation, transmission, and distribution, as well as the consumption of electricity, in an electric network that is likely constrained by the effects of loop flows or thermal limits of transmission lines [17]. Moreover, China’s long history of regulated economic institutions [18,19], and the na- tional conditions of socialism with Chinese characteristics [20], add another layer of complexity to the transition from regulated to com- petitive electricity markets [21,22]. Located in southwestern China, Yunnan, the eighth largest province in China, has a geographical area of 394,000 km2 [23], accounting for 4% of China’s total land mass. Twenty-five counties in the province share international borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar [24,25]. The mountainous terrain, which descends from the high northwest to the low southeast, gives the province massive hydropower resources [26,27].
As one of the five provincial grids in the China Southern Power Grid (CSG) and the largest energy exporter of the southern corridor for the West-East Electricity Transfer (WEET) project, the Yunnan Power Grid (YNPG) operates asynchronously with the CSG, utilizing ultra-high voltage direct current transmission lines to export power to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, as well as to Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar [28]. By the end of 2018, the total length of YNPG’s transmission lines with voltages of 35 kV and above reached 100,000 km, 35 times their extent in 1978, when the reforms were first initiated. The 500 kV backbone electric network covers 16 prefectures in the province, and the WEET capacity reaches 31.15 GW [29] (see Fig. 1), 125 times the capacity of 1993, when the project started. The intricate interconnected grid structure imposes various operational constraints and reliability re- quirements on the electricity market, challenging the congestion man- agement [30].
As of 2018, Yunnan had a total installed generation capacity of approximately 93 GW, over 70 times that of 1978, with 16% coming from coal power and 84% from renewable energy sources (RESs), a share that was much greater than the national average of 31%, con- sisting of 71% hydropower, 10% wind power, and 3% solar power [31]. In markets with high RESs penetration, however, poor control of water inflows for most hydro plants and the variabilities and intermittencies of wind and solar power challenge the goal of fully integrating RESs [23,32].
In 2018, the annual electricity consumption of Yunnan reached 167.91 TWh [33], over 38 times that of 1978. This consumption sup- ports provincial economic development and household electrification. However, the electricity consumption of Yunnan largely results from energy-intensive heavy industries, such as non-ferrous metals and me- tallurgy. Most of these industries involve raw material production and processing, industries that are susceptible to competition from inter- national and domestic markets and are highly responsive to energy prices [28]. A trade-off between heavy industries' expectation of low prices and generators' expectation of revenues challenges the market, given electricity’s key role as the underpinning of Yunnan’s industrial economy. Moreover, in the interest of supporting the state-owned en- terprises (SOEs) in becoming stronger, better, and larger [34], market prices are tempting targets for manipulation [35], either by electricity- producing monopolists or consuming monopsonists [36,37], implying competing policy pressures on market design.
The remainder of this paper begins by briefly reviewing the history of electricity reform in China and in its southwestern province, Yunnan, in Section 2. To demonstrate how the Yunnan electricity market func- tions in practice, market design fundamentals and embedded incentives are reviewed in detail by focusing on important areas related to elec- tricity markets in Section 3. Then, the practical experiences of the re- forms in action are summarized in Section 4. Challenges to reforms, policy implications, and suggestions for further reforms related to seven aspects of the electricity market system are proposed in Section 5. Fi- nally, conclusions are provided in Section 6.
2. Brief overview of electricity reforms
Yunnan’s electricity system originated in 1910, when the first hydro plant—Shilongba [38]—was built in mainland China [39]. Reforms of Yunnan’s electricity system followed the steps dictated by the central reforms and generally underwent four stages.
2.1. Stage 1: Reforming investment
Prior to electricity reforms, China exercised a command and control state monopoly over the electricity sector [19]. This state monopoly, as an assistant to the planned economy, played a crucial role in concentrating limited resources on building backbone projects during this period [40]. Nonetheless, electricity is a capital-intensive industry, and due to a shortage of funding the slow growth of power generation combined with the demands of economic development caused a long- term power shortage [18]. Therefore, in the first stage of the reforms of 1978–1997, the priority was to address the longstanding power shortages by encouraging multiple investments in electricity [20,41]. As a result, decision-making was decentralized down to the provincial level, a variety of electricity tariffs were implemented, and new fi- nancial approaches were introduced to address the financial issues and power shortages that restricted economic development. For example, a World Bank loan was obtained for the construction of the Lubuge hy- droelectric project, which utilized international competitive bidding for the first time in China [42]; joint funding from both central and local governments was provided to build the Manwan hydropower plant [43]; and cross-trade investment from other industries was in- corporated into the electricity sector to break up the state monopoly [44]. In addition, the central government successfully addressed fi- nancial constraints and promoted the development of power sources by means of deregulation of generation and the adoption of electricity tariff reforms. By 1997, the nationwide power shortage had been alle- viated. The state monopoly over electricity had been transformed into a dual-track system dominated by central SOEs coexisting with diversi- fied investors and owners of power generation [19].
2.2. Stage 2: Separation of government functions from enterprise
The second stage of reform, from 1998 to 2002, focused on the separation of government functions from business functions in the electricity sector. The Ministry of Electricity Power (MEP) was abol- ished, with its business functions (generation, transmission, and dis- tribution) taken over by the newly established State Power Company (SPC) and the administrative functions transferred to the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC). The SPC carried out the company's shareholding transformation and took over the operation of the state-owned assets of generation, transmission and distribution that had previously been managed by the MEP through its various pro- vincial branches. At the local level, under the oversight of local gov- ernments, the administrative functions of the local electric power bu- reaus or companies were transferred to the local economic management departments, while the business functions were taken over by the SPC’s local branches [45]. In the southwest, based on the Yunnan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (YPEPB), the Yunnan Electric Power Company was established in 1993, and then was reorganized into the Yunnan Electric Power Group as a local branch of the SPC when YPEPB was abolished in 1998. Manwan, Yangzonghai, and several other power generation companies were established as well, strengthening the business positions of these enterprises. During the same period, under the framework of the national strategy for “Great Development of the Western Region” [46], Yunnan built its first tie line with the Southern Interconnection Grid (the former CSG), which was the very first transmitting channel for WEET in Yunnan, and officially started ex- porting hydropower to Guangdong in 1993. Alongside the vigorous development of small hydropower, electricity prices drastically de- clined, and the electrification of rural areas burgeoned as electric ser- vice obligations strengthened.
2.3. Stage 3: Divesture of generation from grid
Another goal of the second stage of reforms was to explore the feasibility of breaking up the vertically integrated monopoly in order to encourage competition to reduce electricity prices and promote energy consumption [47]. However, the pilot program was terminated in 2000, because it was difficult to maintain equal competition between the vertically integrated monopolist and independent power plants prior to the separation of grid and generation assets. The third stage of reform began in late 2002, marked by the issuance of the “Reform Plan of Electricity Power System” (Document 5) by the China State Council [21]. This third stage of reform, currently recognized as the most significant reform prior to the recent reforms [48], aimed at i) breaking up the monopoly and introducing competition in generation to improve effi- ciency and reduce costs; ii) promoting nationwide interconnection; and iii) reforming the pricing mechanism to allocate resources cost-effec- tively, thereby creating a modern electricity market system while es- tablishing governmental regulation accordingly [19]. As part of this reform, the SPC was broken into two grid companies, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and CSG, and five independent generators [49]. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) was estab- lished to supervise the electricity industry and the market, and the SETC was dismantled, with its functions assigned to the National Develop- ment and Reform Commission (NDRC) and SERC. In the Southwest, with its huge electric potential unlocked by the removal of institutional constraints, Yunnan divested generation from grid assets, forming YNPG, several local autonomous grids, and multiple generation com- panies, contributing significantly to the rapid development of Yunnan’s electricity industry in the following years. Afterwards, the electric network backbone was further strengthened, rural grids were greatly extended and renovated, and the problem of full electrification for the population was thoroughly addressed by 2012. After a century of de- velopment, electricity has grown into one of the pillar industries of Yunnan’s economy. As a result, given its advantages of geography and natural resources [50,51], Yunnan evolved into one of the country’s energy bases and became an important exporter of WEET [52]. Fur- thermore, since the third stage of the reforms, the installed capacity of YNPG has expanded vigorously, with an average annual growth rate of 14% in 2002–2018, including the 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP, 2011–2015) period, which saw an average annual growth rate of 17% [53]. However, as results of a sluggish economic recovery during the 12th FYP period, substantial hydropower surpluses emerged, giving rise to the need for curtailment and the stranded costs of coal power plants.
2.4. Stage 4: The new round of reform
The previous three rounds of reforms surmounted difficulties in different historical periods and provided the preliminary basis for competitive electricity markets. However, several major issues, such as the absence of markets in resource allocation, distorted pricing, and uncoordinated planning and operation, as well as an imperfect RES development mechanism, remained unsolved. These problems, accom- panied by climate change mitigation objectives, kept driving new re- forms. With the issuance of Document 9 in 2015, a new round of reform spread quickly across the country. In the following years, transmission and distribution prices were unbundled, market competition was in- troduced, relatively independent power exchanges were founded, pri- vate capital was introduced into the distribution business, and many retail companies were formed.
Taking a path slightly different from the central reforms to address hydropower curtailment and low industrial utilization due to highly regulated electricity prices, Yunnan started its fourth stage of reforms in the electricity sector beginning in mid-2014, prior to the nationwide reforms [54]. In 2014, Yunnan established a rudimentary wholesale market for electricity, in which a small portion of energy was ex- changed in a free-trade fashion between nine hydro plants and key industrial consumers during the wet season of the year, with all other energy purchased and sold monopolistically by YNPG. This market was extended the next year, when Yunnan was selected as one of the pilot provinces for comprehensive reform. Government quotas, i.e., con- sumption plans for industrial consumers, and generation plans for hydro and coal power plants of 220 kV and above, were further reduced [28,55]. With the introduction of the priority generation plan in 2016, followed by the unbundling of transmission and distribution prices (formerly concealed in electricity prices) [56,57], the market further extended and embraced power plants of 110 kV, including wind and solar power, as price takers, and the power trading business was offi- cially separated from YNPG and transferred to the newly founded power exchange. The market was continuously revised to accommodate special balancing scenarios needed, given the interaction between the large share of supply provided by RESs and the importance of relatively inelastic industrial demand. In the following two years, by learning from the reform experiences and continuously improving the design, Yunnan sequentially incorporated retail competition and commercial users into the market to encourage more participation [58,59], estab- lished a credit rating system based on performance by market players to incentivize good market behavior, and enriched trading options and rules to facilitate RES integration and promote market efficiency. The details of this stage of reform are discussed in Section 3 below.
3. Market design and fundamentals
Created by Leonid Hurwicz and further developed by Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson, mechanism design theory, which takes an en- gineering approach to designing economic mechanisms or incentives, has been widely used in many fields, such as monopoly pricing, optimal taxation, contract theory, principal-agent theory, and auction theory [60]. In the real world, the general issue is whether, for any given economic or social goal, a mechanism can be designed such that the interests of the participants in an economic event are consistent with the established goals of the designer under the conditions of decen- tralized decision-making, such as free choice, voluntary exchange, and incomplete information [61]. Decentralized decisions are adopted for resource allocation or other economic decisions when economic in- formation is incomplete, or impossible to access [62]. As inconsistency between individual and social interests is common, in the case that the designer does not have all the individual information, one of the basic principles is that the mechanism can incentivize each participant to maximize individual interests whilst achieving the overall goal—the “incentive compatibility principle” of mechanism design theory.
Given that electricity markets are characterized by decentralized decision-making and asymmetric information, the incentive compat- ibility mechanism has been widely studied and used in electricity markets. For example, a study focusing on auctions for electricity finds that incentive-compatible Vickrey auctions have potential advantages in generation bidding, despite the fact that the welfare ranking is am- biguous [63]. Another mechanism with incentive compatibility is pro- posed in the application of mechanism design to electricity markets to relieve transmission congestion and achieves economic dispatch with efficient outcomes given generators acting in their own best interest [64]. In a study of bidding mechanisms for electricity markets facing market power and non-concave benefits, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction incentivizing bidders to bid truthfully is found to be efficient in allocating resources [65]. In a comparative study of VCG and locational marginal pricing (LMP) mechanisms, the incentive- compatible VCG mechanism achieves better outcomes in terms of reaching a truth-telling equilibrium under certain supply curves [66]. In another study of electricity markets, an incentive-compatibility- based two-stage model demonstrates better outcomes and ensures ef- ficiency under high wind power penetration compared to LMP model [67].
Based on the theoretical foundations and the application of in- centive compatibility to networked systems [68,69], Yunnan in- corporated incentive compatibility into its market design to motivate market players to participate actively, reveal energy costs truthfully and act consistently with market rules.
3.1. Incentive-compatible architecture
3.1.1. Incentive to participate
Owing to an insufficient understanding of market reforms and generators' expectation of guaranteed revenues stemming from China’s long planned economy history, market players' enthusiasm for partici- pating in the market was not high at the outset [70]. It makes no sense to design a market without participation. Thus, a goal of market design will be to incentivize as many players as possible to participate and to increase the market-based share of energy consumption. Therefore, incentives were introduced via the settlement process to encourage the participation of players. For consumers, energy prices would become market-based, instead of administrative, once they entered the market, and a higher price, e.g., the highest price of the market, would be charged as a penalty for uncontracted consumption. The goal of rational consumers is to minimize costs or maximize profit [71]. Thus, they have incentives to participate in market competition and attempt to mini- mize costs by bidding reasonably. For power plants, a large portion of government quotas under the regulated system were abolished. Therefore, they had to turn to the market to sell energy. They might otherwise be shut off, due to lack of market contracts, or be settled at a lower price, e.g., the lowest price of the market, for uncontracted production. Therefore, to maximize profits, power plants were given incentives to participate in the market to sell energy at prices as high as possible.
3.1.2. Incentive for truthfulness
Another important goal of market design is to reveal the cost of energy, i.e., to encourage market players to act truthfully regarding energy quantity and price [66,72]. To promote truthfulness, penalties would be imposed on market players for deviations from market con- tracts due to dishonest actions. For instance, in the day-ahead trans- action (DAT), introduced in 2016, which virtually provides players with a supplemental instrument for offsetting consumption or generation deviations from market contracts [73], to prevent players from falsely bidding and further inducing imbalances in system operation, a de- viation penalty is introduced if players fail to deliver the DAT contracts. In terms of price, unreasonable or irrational bidding may result in disadvantages and losses. For example, in the centralized bidding pro- cess, in which the market is cleared by matching the price differences of buyers and sellers, the clearing prices of the players relate closely to their own bidding prices and the difference between the bids (the return difference), i.e., the price received by a power plant equals its bidding price plus the return difference, and that paid by a consumer equals its bidding price minus the return difference. Thus, actions by players have a decisive impact on their clearing prices. Therefore, market players have incentives to be truth-telling concerning their energy buying and selling. Otherwise, the profit-maximizing or cost-minimizing goal would be affected and potentially increase the transaction risks and penalties for uncontracted energy. These constraints also contribute to the rational bidding of market players.
3.1.3. Incentive for consistency with market rules
As an important condition for ensuring the effective and efficient operation of related transactions in economic activities [74], credit management plays an important role in ensuring efficient and sus- tainable electricity trading [75,76]. To create a benign market atmo- sphere and properly manage the potential risks of market operation, a credit rating system is established, based on market players’ perfor- mance with respect to contract compliance, truthfulness, and following market rules. The proposed credit rating rates market behavior by players to incentivize positive interaction with the market. Rating re- sults impact factors in which market players have strong interests, such as transaction qualifications and security deposits. For example, the rating increases so long as a player fulfills contracts, acts truthfully, bids rationally, and complies with market rules, and then the player may be rewarded with reduced or exempted deposit requirements and other benefits. However, additional deposits would be required, or transac- tion qualifications would be suspended, for players with low ratings, which would potentially increase the cost of energy for consumers or reduce energy revenues for power plants. In other words, the credit rating is closely linked to the interests of market players in order to incentivize behavior consistent with market rules.
3.2. Market entry and exit
Theory and practice around the world have proved that electricity reform is not a one-step process [16,77,78]. It is therefore necessary to provide for a reasonable period for the electricity market to transition from a regulated system to a state of liberalization [14,79,80]. Yunnan is no exception. As required by Document 9, establishing market entry and exit mechanisms requires defining the access conditions for market players related to electricity that meet the requirements for technology, safety, environmental protection, and energy conservation to ensure an orderly market and protect the rights and interests of relevant parties. Accordingly, based on the reform arrangements and assessment of market players, a methodology that manages market entry and exit was established in Yunnan, in line with central and local requirements [13,81]. More importantly, the market entry and exit mechanism has also been linked to the credit rating system in order to incentivize market players to comply with market rules. For example, players who default on electricity bills, power exchange commissions, or security deposits (for retailers only) would be suspended from the market.
Power plants are divided into two categories: market plants and priority (non-market) plants. All small and a few medium-sized hydro plants are classified as priority plants, while wind, solar, coal and other hydro plants are considered market plants. Priority plants are excluded from the market, with generation procured adequately at adminis- trative prices by the grid company, while market plants participate in market competition to sell energy. Consumers are categorized as priority consumers and market consumers. Priority consumers include customers in natural resource industries, public utilities, key public services industries, and residential customers. The grid company pur- chases power on their behalf and preferentially guarantees power supply to them at regulated prices. Market consumers consist of in- dustrial and commercial users with dedicated transformers that meet a variety of governmental and technical requirements. Consumers that qualify for market entry, but have not entered the market, are charged regulated prices for energy consumption. Consumers are required not to withdraw from the market within a year of entry, and their energy prices become market-based whether they participate in the market competition or not. Retailers can purchase energy on the wholesale market and then resell it to their customers, as long as they meet re- levant requirements and provide the documents as required [81]. Se- curity deposits for retailers, starting at 2 million RMB, with full amounts set in accordance with transaction volumes and prices, are considered escrow for their transactions and managed by a dedicated bank account.
3.3. Provincial market trading
Market players are most concerned about whether the trading rules are fair and conducive to their trading actions and strategies once they enter the market. In the early stage, players lack insights into the in- herent characteristics of market operation and focus on electricity prices. Their divergences on key elements, such as prices, may result in transaction failures. Thus, the demand for multiple transactions and trading periods is high. As such, as presented in Fig. 2, a trading system that combines peer-to-peer, face-to-face, and back-to-back games and features in time-progressive, game-continuous, and multi-collaborative transactions, is designed for players to equilibrate the market.
3.3.1. Bilateral transactions
Bilateral transactions are conducted in an over-the-counter fashion, in which market players negotiate, make decentralized decisions, and then sign electricity trading contracts [82]. Bilateral contracts can be divided into financial and physical contracts, according to the different ways of delivering the contracted energy [83]. Physical contracts are signed by two parties that agree on delivering and consuming a certain quantity of energy at specified prices. Financial contracts lock in energy prices and require financially binding commitments, rather than phy- sical delivery [84]. For example, contracts for differences (CfDs), which are widely used around the world, are two-way-hedging contracts in which the seller pays the buyer the difference between spot price and strike price when spot price is higher, and vice versa [85]. Forward contracts shield market players from the risk of exposure to spot price volatility [86], and also mitigate market power to some extent [87], as players with contracts enter the spot market with more balanced po- sitions and thus have fewer incentives to exercise market power [88]. 
Arising from the direct power purchases by large users in China [62,89], bilateral contracts in Yunnan include annual, multi-month, and monthly agreements with specified energy quantities and prices between sellers (power plants) and buyers (consumers or retailers). However, in contrast to the widely used forward contracts that do not require physical delivery, and thus enable more flexibility for system operation [90], bilateral contracts in the Yunnan electricity market are more like physical contracts, as there are no electricity-related deriva- tives in China. In addition, as a result of the longstanding regulated market, power plants and consumers barely know about each other. Therefore, it is costly for market players to reach bilateral contracts, given asymmetric information. To incentivize participation as well as reduce transaction costs and information asymmetry, a peer-to-peer power exchange platform with online-to-offline services, in which both parties can post needs information for energy buying and selling and tentative prices and find information about potential negotiating part- ners, is provided to market players in order to reduce information asymmetry and transaction costs. The power exchange does not play any role in the contract process beyond the information exchange ser- vices. As there is no spot market to signal a spot price, market players may feel anxious when signing contracts, because it is unlikely that they will be able to determine prices accurately in the long run. Therefore, a price hedging provision, in which both parties are hedged from un- reasonable prices by being allowed to renegotiate contract prices to reach a new consensus price in line with a benchmark-dependent re- adjustment mechanism (benchmarking against the average clearing price of centralized bidding) [91], is offered to relieve these anxieties. In this way, bilateral transactions are promoted and price risks are re- duced. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show that market players use this price read- justment mechanism to readjust prices to achieve a balance of interests of both sides. In addition to the price readjustment, in order to reduce the effect of uncertain fuel supply and other contingencies, a month- ahead mutual insurance, in which players can transfer part or all of their bilateral contracts to peers, is provided as well. As demonstrated 
in Fig. 5, the appeal of the ability to lock in energy and hedge prices and have access to multiple-period choices and flexible insurance measures, is reflected in the fact that bilateral contracts make up the majority of all transactions.
3.3.2. Bidding and auctions
Effective bidding and auctions in electricity markets encourage ef- ficiency by establishing incentives consistent with the goals of market players [93]. Studies with respect to bidding and auctions in electricity markets, including auction types [94,95], and pricing rules [96,97], have been carried out extensively [98,99], among which marginal pricing (MP, including LMP) and pay-as-bid (PAB) are mostly used in regard to the clearance of auctions [100]. For example, discouraging generation competition and capacity expansion are believed to be the major issues associated with PAB [101]. In the presence of strategic interaction, the clearing price may be higher under PAB as opposed to MP [102]. A switch from MP to PAB auctions is unlikely to produce lower price and may incur adverse results for market efficiency [103], raising the concern of PAB deterring potential entrant [104]. However, the introduction of PAB suggests an increase in consumer surplus under competitive conditions [105], and may be promising in markets where the products are not homogeneous [106]. Setting aside the debate over MP and PAB, the Yunnan electricity market is not as developed as ad- vanced markets are, e.g., LMP-based U.S. markets [90], or zonal-pri- cing-based Europe markets [107]. Therefore, as described below, Yunnan has developed alternatives involving a centralized bidding process that matches buyers and sellers, and additional auctions, attempting to promote market transactions.
Centralized bidding is a back-to-back transaction process within a
static game and is organized a month ahead to trade the residual energy after bilateral contracts are determined. As can be seen in Fig. 2, to improve the matchmaking probabilities, market players can bid in tranches (three tranches for a power plant, one tranche for a consumer, and N tranches for a retailer, with N the number of its represented customers) at two prices. The first price of each tranche of a power plant is no less than the second price. Conversely, the first price of each tranche of a consumer or retailer is no more than the second price. Centralized bidding sorts the bidding prices in ascending order for sellers and descending order for buyers, then matches the lowest bid price of a seller to the highest bid price of a buyer in two corresponding rounds, conditioned on non-negative price differences. As described specifically in an early study [28], this pricing is a modified form of PAB pricing, essentially associated with a splitting coefficient k. Each matched pair of players would receive different prices related to their bidding prices. Market players thus have incentives to manage energy portfolios and truthfully reveal their costs to facilitate successful transactions, pursue profits, and further increase market efficiency. The splitting coefficient k changed from 0.5 in 2014 and 2015 [54,55] to 0.35 in 2016 and then to 0.1 in 2017 [58,108]. The pricing ultimately turned into PAB, with k as 0 in 2018 [59]. The resulting price differ- ences are included in a settlement balancing pool discussed below. Fig. 6 shows that the second-price bids are especially important during the transition between the dry and wet seasons (May, Jun., Nov., and Dec.). For better RES integration, bids of RESs are cleared prior to those of coal power plants. In order to avoid price volatility, a price cap and floor are set in all centralized transactions.
Fig. 7 demonstrates the effect of the average clearing price of cen- tralized bidding. As can be seen, centralized bidding plays a vital role in discovering prices. Although bilateral contracting prevails, centralized bidding still is the highlighted transaction, as its price signal impacts not only the final prices of the preceding bilateral contracts but also the prices of the following auctions and system up-balancing actions.
Evolving from the single listed auction in 2016, in which consumers listed energy quantity desired at a price, and power plants delisted these entries if the price was acceptable, a three-step double listed auction was adopted in 2017 to address the problem of competition adequacy [109]. Fig. 2 shows that, in the first step, buyers and sellers post expected energy quantities and tentative prices. In the second step, buyers list proposed energy purchases and final prices, with quantities constrained by the formerly posted quantity. Sellers can then delist acceptable buyer postings. Subsequently, in the third step, buyers and sellers switch places and repeat the auction. Transaction prices are the final listed prices. The posting in the first step reduces information asymmetry and incentivizes market players to reveal truthful needs for energy. In the following two steps, market players enter a face-to-face dynamic game that encourages them to gradually adjust strategies, given the information gradually revealed in different steps, to reach final equilibria. As reported in an early study [109], this three-step double listed auction is useful in reducing transaction risks, in- centivizing reasonable bidding, and expanding transaction volume.
Another problem is the transaction inadequacy that arises from identical bidding prices. For example, all of the hydro plants bid to the floor price in the wet season, and the bids are then cleared in proportion to their bidding quantities. To address this and improve efficiency, a continuous auction that incorporates a time-based priority—first-come, first-served—was adopted in 2018. The continuous auction proceeds in two steps. In the first step, market players post the same information as they do in the double listed auction. In the second step, bids and offers are matched and cleared instantly, based on non-negative price differ- ences. Fig. 2 shows that bids and offers in the first 20 min are con- sidered as bids at the same time and are cleared using the same algo- rithm as in centralized bidding, with the two sides splitting the price difference. Any bidding changes would instantly trigger the match- making in the second step. Continuous auctioning is widely used in commodity trading and is nothing new. Nonetheless, with adaptation and application to the Yunnan electricity market, the face-to-face dy- namics and unpredictability in a continuous auction incentivize market players to modify their bidding strategies continuously to approach a balance of interests. Fig. 8 shows the active participation in and results of the monthly continuous auctions in 2018, providing empirical evi- dence of the benefits of this design.
3.3.3. Supplemental DAT
Though bilateral contracts and monthly bidding and auctions meet the majority of the need for energy purchases and sales by market players [110], the possibility of new demand or generation emerging after the monthly transactions, e.g., new manufacturing orders received by a consumer, or an unexpected flood for a run-of-the-river hydro plant, suggests a need for a marketplace for buying and selling the extra energy. However, there is no spot market for electricity in China. To address the inflexibility of monthly trades and further explore the po- tential of reform, a day-ahead energy transaction was introduced as a supplement to monthly transactions in 2016. The DAT market differs from organized day-ahead markets elsewhere in the world, which ty- pically establish financially binding commitments that enable merit- order and efficient dispatch [111,112]. In contrast, the DAT in- corporates a block of energy as the subject matter and requires physical delivery, attempting in this way to incentivize market players to be truthful about their additional needs for energy and to offer them flexibility in offsetting deviations from market contracts—deviations that, if not offset, incur penalties when monthly transactions end. The DAT includes only players who qualify for daily metering. It operates on weekdays, with energy for weekends and holidays cleared on the weekday immediately prior. The DAT uses the same bidding and pri- cing rules as the aforementioned centralized bidding process, except that in the DAT, players can only bid a single tranche at a single price (a retailer could still bid N tranches, representing N customers). Price differences between buyers and sellers are also included in the settle- ment balancing pool. Since market players could be incentivized to default on monthly contracts by attempting to expand the DAT volume if the price difference between the DAT price and that of monthly transactions is greater than the penalty for defaulting on monthly contracts (30 RMB/MWh), a constraint over the bids of consumers and retailers, in the form of a daily base of energy consumption, is in- troduced to ensure physical delivery. The daily base is formulated as follows: Fig. 9 demonstrates the results of the DAT in the past three years. The DAT volumes stayed below 10 GWh for most days in the dry season, when prices were relatively high, prior to Jun. 2016. The DAT then became energetic with the arrival of the wet season. The demand side was highly responsive to price. Prices fell to the floor price speedily in the wet season, resulting in a precipitately increased DAT volume for inelastic consumers with insufficient monthly transactions. After that, the price bounced back, and the DAT volume dropped as water inflows declined from Nov. 2016 to the end of the year. In the following two years, the DAT trading volume shrank as bilateral transactions that gave players more balanced positions continued to expand. The DAT gen- erally saw fewer transactions and relatively lower prices at the begin- ning of any given month and more transactions and higher prices to- ward the end of the month.
The DAT reflects rational bidding and the seasonal changes in de- mand and supply; however, it fails to provide price signals for dispatch [73]. The market model fails to incorporate economic dispatch and incentivize flexibility for system operation, due to the absence of cer- tain conditions, such as more granular metering or upgrading of dis- patch automation systems. Thus, the implementation of market con- tracts rests on daily decomposition and redispatch. In contrast with organized electricity markets, where prices of day-ahead or real-time markets signal decisions going forward, price signals from medium- and long-term trading are more likely to be the drivers in the Yunnan electricity market, due to the absence of a spot market. If certain con- ditions, however, such as metering and dispatching systems, were available at the outset, then there would have been no need to design such a DAT.
Despite these arguments, as a supplement to monthly transactions, the DAT has been empirically shown to be supportive and useful in reducing the penalty for contract deviations for market players, and thus promotes a more balanced market [113,114]. Up to this point, Yunnan has shaped its provincial market model around medium- and long-term trading, supplemented by a short-term DAT [114].
3.3.4. Retail competition
Retail competition, alongside competition in generation, reduces market imperfections, makes electricity prices more cost-reflective, enables consumer choices in electricity, and provides better energy services [115]. Another highlight of the new round of reform has been the introduction of competition into electricity sales, a move that has given rise to many expectations of improvements in cost and service. However, this reform began only in 2017 for Yunnan, and retail com- petition is still at an early stage, due to limited understanding of the electricity retail business and relatively high requirements for entry [81]. A relatively simple design has been adopted in Yunnan’s retail competition reform. Retailers play the role of intermediary agents be- tween wholesale and retail markets and mainly provide energy-buying services for small industrial and commercial customers, utilizing basic profit models, such as splitting prices and fixed-rate commissions. Moreover, value-added services offered by retailers, such as load management, integrated energy solutions, and demand response co- ordination, are currently scarce in the Yunnan electricity market. The tailored rules for retailers in energy trading are described as below.
Customers represented by retailers are expected to meet the re- quirements for market entry. One customer can only choose one retailer at a time. No multiple principal-agent relationships are allowed. Once the principal-agent relationships are determined, they are required to remain unchanged for at least three months, and customers cannot withdraw from the market for the duration of the relationship.
Due to inconsistencies in money flows, power flows, and invoice flows of retailers, along with regulations on value-added tax invoices, the grid company is unable to provide electricity invoices and settle- ments to retailers directly, because retailers are not the end consumers of electricity. Instead, the grid company can only provide invoices and settlements to end consumers. Therefore, retailers are required to al- locate their monthly contracts twice—before and after delivery—to the customers they represent.
Pre-allocation. Once monthly contracts are determined, retailers are supposed to allocate them to their customers with specific energy quantities and prices ex ante. If retailers fail to allocate contracts, they are allocated evenly. The purpose of this pre-allocation is to determine the monthly contracts of customers who are involved in the DAT for the purpose of calculating their daily bases of consumption.
Ex-post allocation. After energy delivery, retailers are required to reallocate the final quantities and prices for customers to settle. The reallocation rules are as follows: Likewise, in the absence of a retailer’s reallocation, energy quan- tities consumed by customers represented by the retailer would be re- allocated in proportion to the customers' actual consumption, and prices would be averaged. 3.4. Inter-provincial trading
China is typically characterized as having uneven resource dis- tribution and imbalanced economic development between its western and eastern regions [116]. For example, among the five provinces that the CSG covers, Guangdong province has the largest GDP, along with a high rate of economic growth, and thus accounts for over 60% of the CSG-wide electricity consumption, while the western provinces, Yunnan and Guizhou, have relatively stagnant economies and the ma- jority of the energy reserves in the area. Thus, there is a strong com- plementarity between the resources and economies in the western and eastern regions, providing a reason to develop the western energy re- sources and transmission to the eastern load centers, through the WEET project, to even out the imbalances and promote mutually beneficial development.
As an exporter in the WEET project, Yunnan has a framework agreement, signed with Guangdong every five years, in which the quantity and price of electricity for every year within a five-year period are specified. Energy beyond the amounts specified in the agreement is expected to be exchanged in an inter-provincial market operated by the regional power exchange in southern China. The purpose of inter-pro- vincial trading is to implement the WEET project for better RES in- tegration and resource allocation. Such trading is comprised of various kinds of monthly transactions: bilateral agreements, centralized auc- tions, generation rights transfers, excess power auctions, and so on [117].

23,"Market reform of Yunnan electricity in southwestern China: Practice, challenges and implications","This paper reviews the electricity market reforms improving resource allocation and renewable energy integration in Yunnan. Given the predominance of hydropower and the importance of energy exports in Yunnan, the province presents a challenging case study of electricity market reforms. The experience of and lessons from Yunnan provide a reference for other provinces in China engaged in the growing adoption of renewable energy. The main contributions of this paper lie in the extension of the existing understanding of electricity reforms in Yunnan and China. Based on extensive data previously unreported in the literature, this paper shows how the Yunnan electricity market functions in practice and indicates where the practice is deficient in terms of the theory of how electricity markets should function. Finally, this paper suggests how market reforms should be adopted toward a scientifically designed electricity market.","However, as shown in Fig. 10, only generation rights transfers and excess power auctions have been successfully organized in recent years. Excess power listed auctions have accounted for the most activity in these years. This fact can likely be attributed to i) the leading role of autonomous provinces in the protection of local interests, resulting in reluctance to receive imported energy, i.e., so-called “local pro- tectionism”, or inter-provincial barriers; ii) inconsistent reform progress across provinces and a lack of coordination among the various stake- holders in building regional electricity markets; and iii) arbitrary price formation, rather than the market-based pricing mechanisms, and failures to reflect energy costs and scarcity prices. For example, the price in Yunnan’s inter-provincial trades with Guangdong in 2016 and that of the generation rights transfers between Yunnan and Guizhou were negotiated by relevant government departments. Starting from 2017, the price to Guangdong has been set by averaging the prices of the Yunnan and Guangdong markets. More importantly, the price is capped at the WEET framework-agreement price (252.78 RMB/MWh, the benchmark on-grid price of Guangdong’s coal power unit deducting transmission and loss prices), even in the presence of a power shortage in Guangdong (for example, in Jan. 2018, in Fig. 10), at a time when the Yunnan market was also tight.
However, for Yunnan, overcapacity, the seasonality of hydropower, and the resulting supply surplus renders its position in inter-provincial trading poor, as increasing exports to Guangdong remains the most effective way available to dampen hydropower curtailment, given current grid interconnections. Despite the slow progress of the regional electricity market, by exploiting the CSG interconnections, Yunnan strives to expand exports via market mechanisms to allocate resources across a larger area and promotes an inter-provincial trading model of plan + market, in which the framework-agreement energy is considered as traded under a bilateral government contract, and energy beyond that is to be exchanged via market mechanisms.
Inter-provincial trading mainly involves the sending and receiving provinces, Yunnan and Guangdong. Sometimes, Guizhou is also in- volved, replacing its coal-power generation with Yunnan’s hydropower generation due to coal supply shortages. For instance, the generation rights transfer between Yunnan’s hydro plants and Guizhou’s coal power plants is realized by reducing exports from Guizhou to Guangdong, and accordingly increasing exports from Yunnan. However, the benefits realized by the exporting parties are limited. The buyer, Guangdong, still pays the framework-agreement price, a price that Yunnan and Guizhou split, according to a proportion negotiated by relevant government departments. Sellers in inter-provincial trading are hydro plants in Yunnan, most of which are either the “backbone plants” of 500 kV or major plants related to the WEET project. Buyers are the grid companies of corresponding provinces. This implies that not all market players are eligible for inter-provincial trading, and market discrimination remains likely. In a divergence from the ap- proach used in provincial markets, qualifications for inter-provincial trading in Yunnan are separately managed by government departments. However, despite the shortcomings noted above, current inter-pro- vincial trading has played an important role in promoting resource al- location over a larger area and in reducing hydropower curtailment. For example, the volumes of inter-provincial trading in the past three years were 13.5, 23.4 and 15TWh [118], respectively, representing power which would otherwise have been curtailed, adding to overall levels of hydropower curtailment.
3.5. Ensuring generation adequacy: Long-term coal power reserve (LTCPR) remuneration
“Resource adequacy” refers to providing sufficient resources to en- sure safe and reliable grid operation and incentivizing new resources needed for reliability in the future [119,120]. Normally, generation adequacy should not be much of a problem in electricity markets with overcapacity [121], especially in markets dominated by flexible hy- dropower, such as Yunnan. From the perspective of balancing demand and supply in the long run, however, in addition to uncertainties in the economy and in electricity demand, overreliance on one type of gen- eration that is vulnerable to climate change and hydrological variability challenges system reliability, and thus gives rise to demand for other sources of generation as backup capacity for hydropower-dominated markets [122]. Nevertheless, market deficiencies, such as the failure to incorporate granular economic dispatch into the market model, the absence of real-time pricing, the inability to reflect costs, and in- sufficient demand-side response, seem to make it unlikely that re- formers will succeed in the design of a complicated capacity market consistent with the spot market, or in the development of an energy- only market with co-optimization of energy and ancillary services in ways that reflect scarcity and encourage demand response at the outset [123,124]. As such, since 2016, Yunnan has adopted a mechanism of LTCPR remuneration in market design based on its energy portfolios, attempting to i) mitigate the effect of hydropower interruption induced by hydrological risks and ensure generation adequacy for reliability for its hydropower-based electricity system; and ii) address the problem of the stranded costs of coal power plants due to electricity restructuring and pressures from climate change and RES integration.
Theoretically, according to the principles of “beneficiaries pay” [125], consumers are expected to pay for reliability, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. However, due to historical reasons, on-grid prices of power plants in China are deemed to include ancillary services costs. Thus, the costs of ancillary services have long been shared only on the generation side, without being explicitly passed along to con- sumers. In effect, the costs are internalized in electricity tariffs that consumers pay. This cost sharing on the generation side remains un- changed, even when prices of electricity from power plants are market- based. The inertia of consumers not paying for ancillary services per- sists. Given this situation, to promote a smooth transition and facilitate electricity reforms, a similar sharing approach was adopted in LTCPR remuneration, which collects from RESs to remunerate coal power plants for their back-up capacity under extreme low capacity factors in line with the following rules.
3.5.1. Remuneration amount and sources
Considering the balancing scenarios in demand and supply, pro- jected coal power generation needed, the financial positions of the coal power plants, and a comparison of pre- and post-reform revenues, the remuneration required to support the regular operation and main- tenance of coal power plants is approximately 2 billion RMB per year, in addition to energy revenues. Renewable market plants and non- market (priority) hydro plants pay 10 and 20 RMB/MWh, respectively, in line with their production, to support the remuneration mechanism. Exact remuneration depends on the production of RESs. For example, coal power plants would be remunerated less for providing back-up capacity, while earning more generation revenue, if variable RESs under-produce, and vice versa.
3.5.2. Reserve capacity calculation
To incentivize the required back-up capacity, the equivalent capa- cities of reliability-must-run (RMR) and market contracts of coal power plants are excluded; the equivalent remuneration capacity is calculated and paid as below: where Ci is the equivalent reserve capacity of the ith coal power LTCPR unit, Ci is the rated capacity of the ith coal power unit, Ci is the rated RMR
equivalent RMR capacity of the ith coal power unit, Ci is the mkt equivalent capacity of market contracts of the ith coal power unit, qi mkt is the market contracts of the ith coal power unit, Hi is the number of run running hours of the ith RMR unit and Hmo is the number of hours in a month. Furthermore, penalties for under- or non-performance, similar to incentives for operational performance in capacity markets [126], are also introduced into LTCPR remuneration to incentivize parties to fulfill their capacity performance commitments. That is, the LTCPR re- muneration of coal power plants links to their coal storage and opera- tional maintenance. Coal power plants must keep sufficient coal storage to support potential capacity back-up, especially during times when the market is usually tight, such as during the transition from the dry to wet season. Otherwise, they would be penalized by i) 10% of the re- muneration, if their coal supply is below the level of a red alert; and ii) either part or 100% of the remuneration in the case of non-performance (failure to start up as required), subject to a decision by government departments.
In practice, LTCPR remuneration of nearly 2.1 billion RMB per year has been paid for the back-up capacities of coal power plants in the past three years, addressing coal power plants’ losses incurred in operating and maintaining themselves at very low capacity factors. As observed in Fig. 11, these back-up capacities were activated in the first half of 2018, successfully coping with the challenge of fast-growing electricity de- mand and low hydropower reservoirs caused by insufficient water in- flows.
3.6. Coordinated system operation
Inflexibility induced by the relatively physical monthly contracts (which include penalties for failing to use or generate contracted amounts of energy) impedes system operation, as there is neither a spot market to signal real-time prices and further incentivize the operational flexibility required to maintain reliability nor a financial contract to encourage the trading flexibility required to support the market [127]. As such, a coordinated mechanism, which includes an initial capability assessment, process-control security checks, and real-time balancing, is designed to accommodate a large number of physical contracts while ensuring reliable grid operation.
3.6.1. Capability assessment
Without granular economic dispatch and real-time pricing to pro- vide signals to motivate market players to contribute to system balance and stability, a relatively physical approach of capability assessment is adopted to preclude potential systemic energy imbalances caused by physical contracts. Prior to monthly transactions, the generation cap- abilities of power plants and the consumption capabilities of consumers are assessed using forecasting and historical data.
Based on the forecasts of water inflows and reservoir levels (for large hydropower facilities only) for hydro plants, coal supply for coal power plants, and capacity factors for wind and solar power plants, the generation capabilities of power plants for the coming month are as- sessed and determined ex ante by a co-optimization procedure that takes cursory security-unconstrained economic dispatch into account. Moreover, the results of the generation capability assessment are publicly published, and this pre-determined generation capability then becomes binding for each power plant in subsequent market transac- tions.
The consumption capabilities of consumers rely more on historical data than on forecasts, as the production of industrial consumers and the resulting electric loads are relatively stable over the course of a month. Usually, the consumption capability of a consumer is capped at 110% of its maximum monthly consumption in the last twelve months. For a retailer, the upper boundary of its consumption capability is the sum of the maximum monthly consumption of its represented custo- mers in the previous twelve months. Incremental energy demand be- yond this amount requires justification. The results of the consumption capability assessment are published publicly and serve as constraints in market transactions.
3.6.2. Security check
Following the capability assessment and each of the monthly transactions, a security check that considers security-constrained eco- nomic dispatch and the maintenance plans of grids and generation units over a monthly timeframe is carried out to manage transmission con- gestion. The primary reason for this is that the data available for grids and loads of different voltages in the current power flow calculation system does not meet the requirements for real-time calculation, and thus system users can only perform power flow calculations by manu- ally setting many constraints and data each month.
In light of Yunnan’s numerous rivers and interconnected water- courses, the hydraulic coupling is considered a critical binding con- straint in the centralized economic dispatch to mitigate the potential market power of cascading hydropower and reduce spillages induced by mismatched contracts throughout the hydropower chain. However, this reduces the possibility for decentralized decisions in competitive markets and fails to incorporate a dynamic model to reflect the op- portunity costs of different hydropower facilities [90]. Moreover, di- verging from the bid-based curtailment that encourages minimizing system operating cost, the security check curtails the production of power plants in a relatively arbitrary way by converting the bid energy into average power output and curtailing pro-rata, regardless of prices, if transmission congestion occurs [28], distorting the energy costs and price signals of different locations. A more granular dynamic model with bid-based, security-constrained economic dispatch would be an alternative to correct this [86].
3.6.3. Real-time balancing
Each power plant can bid a price for additional power output in real-time dispatching when monthly transactions end, as there is no spot market. This price is designed to determine the merit order in real- time dispatching when additional power is needed. However, this price becomes meaningless, because it is capped at the average price of the centralized transactions, and every power plant bids to the cap. As such, the daily decomposition of monthly contracts is first used to maintain a real-time balance, then it is system up- or down-balancing. Subsequently, the daily decomposition will be adjusted to minimize deviations from contracts.
However, rolling adjustment of daily follow-up decompositions may not wholly counteract the deviations from contracts due to experience- based system dispatch, which raises the issues of more granular eco- nomic dispatch and real-time pricing again. Therefore, final contract deviations after delivery are to be coped with ex-post contract transfer and settlement.
3.7. Ex-post contract transfer and settlement
3.7.1. Ex-post contract transfer
Contract transfer refers to the market behavior in which the holder of an energy contract, who is called “long” for failing to deliver the contracted energy, offsets its contract by transferring part or all of the contract to a transferee, who is called “short” for producing or con- suming more than its contract. Contract transfer in the Yunnan elec- tricity market changes nothing but the subject of contractual rights and obligations and provides both parties with flexibility and an opportu- nity for counteracting the penalty for deviation from contracts. As a quasi-derivative of electricity, contract transfer provides market players with a hedging tool against contract-delivery risks without impacting the interests of third parties or system operation. Two mechanisms available for contract transfer in Yunnan are bilateral negotiations and centralized auctions.
In organized electricity markets, over-the-counter forward con- tracts, or CfDs, and standardized futures contracts, combined with spot markets, enable risk hedging, system flexibility, and market liquidity [128]. In contrast, however, market contracts in Yunnan are relatively physical, and contract transfer offers market players an opportunity to balance deviations from contracts based on delivery results prior to settlement. As such, to preclude cross financial risks of the potential secondary market, the contract can only be transferred in the parallel manner of plant-to-plant or consumer (retailer)-to-consumer (retailer) at the transferrer’s price. In practice, this ex-post contract transfer has been in use since 2016. Such transactions were carried out only on the generation side in 2016 and 2017, transferring 6.3 and 0.86TWh among power plants, respectively. The mechanism further incorporated consumers and retailers in 2018, transferring 3.6 TWh on the genera- tion side and 1.9TWh on the consumption side [110]. This ex-post contract transfer provides incentives for market players by reducing penalty costs for deviation from market contracts. For example, given the penalty price for contract deviation of 30 RMB/MWh, the transfers reduced penalty costs by 108 and 57 million RMB for power plants and consumers (including retailers) in 2018, respectively, leading to more balanced ex-post positions of the market players prior to settlements.
3.7.2. Settlement
Settlement, playing a crucial role in delivering the monetary results of electricity transactions, is the remuneration for market behavior by players in response to market incentives and is closely related to players’ economic interests. Thus, in turn, settlement impacts market operation. In combination with financial contracts, such as forward and futures contracts, an imbalance settlement or multi-settlement system is adopted in most organized electricity markets, in line with day-ahead and real-time or imbalance markets [129,130]. However, influenced by policies related to domestic financial systems and regulations, elec- tricity markets in China are still groping for relevant financial deriva- tives. The lack of financial derivatives limits market liquidity to some extent and adds a layer of complexity to market settlements. Accord- ingly, explicit settling orders are adopted in market settlements to ac- commodate the relatively physical contracts in the absence of a spot market. YNPG provides metering services to market players and settles electricity for them in line with settlement statements by the power exchange. Market settlements generally follow a rule of “Daily Ac- counting, Monthly Settling, and Liquidating”.
Settlement of consumers and retailers proceeds in the order of the DAT and monthly contracts. The electricity tariff for consumers consists of prices for energy, transmission and distribution, loss, and a basic tariff, as well as government funds and surcharges. Among these, the transmission and distribution prices and government funds and surcharges are products of consumers' actual consumption and corre- sponding regulated prices. Energy price is determined by the market. Loss price is based on an approved loss rate and energy price, and the basic tariff is calculated according to the transformer capacity or the peak demand of consumers. Consumers who enter the market but have no contracts would be charged a penalty price for their consumed en- ergy, if any. Retailers bear 10% of the contract shortfall of their re- presented customers, while customers bear the rest. The power ex- change provides statements of a 100% shortfall to end customers, YNPG collects the full charges from end customers, and then retailers repay their customers 10% of the shortfall. This involvement of retailers in consumers' settlement is intended to incentivize retailers to manage and improve their customers’ electricity consumption, rather than merely to profit from price differences. More details about settlement for con- sumers and retailers can be found in Appendix A.
Settlement of power plants, which consists of two steps, pre-set- tlement and liquidation, is slightly different from that of consumers. Generation from market plants is pre-settled and paid to ensure cash flows prior to contract transfer, then liquidation is carried out to repay or charge power plants when contract transfer is done. Generation from non-market power plants is settled at regulated prices. More details of the pre-settlement and liquidation for all plants, and LTCPR settlement for coal power plants, can be found in Appendix B.
Settlement balancing pool. To financially handle imbalances caused by market players and ensure system balance and reliability, a settlement balancing pool is created to collect price differences in centralized bidding and contract shortfall charges from market players, then pay sequentially to i) market plants for system down-balancing (30 RMB/MWh); ii) coal power plants for price differences between the system up-balancing price paid by YNPG and the benchmark on-grid price of Yunnan’s coal power unit (335.8 RMB/MWh), if they are dis- patched based on reliability issues; and iii) LTCPR remuneration. The income and expenditure of the settlement balancing pool are regularly published to regulators and market players to ensure fairness and transparency.
3.8. Credit rating mechanism
As in other economic activities, credit management also plays an essential role in electricity markets [76]. To create a benign atmosphere and maintain market order, as well as to properly manage the potential risks of market operation, Yunnan established a credit rating me- chanism to encourage interactive contributions of market players to electricity markets, attempting to incentivize compliance, maintain market order, and foster virtuous cycles of market operation. The de- tails of the proposed credit rating system are described below.
3.8.1. Rating subject and criteria
The credit rating system was first designed to rate retailers and then soon extended to all active market players [131,132]. Hierarchically designed, the rating is comprised of two-level indicators, standard scores, and scoring criteria, with a total possible score of 1000. The two- level indicators consist of seven key indicators that cover basic data, contract management, transaction management, transaction results, market compliance, solvency, and credit record, as well as 18–23 sub- indicators in association with different types of players.
3.8.2. Rating level and period
Rating level. The rating level is divided into five grades, through which the rating goes from excellent to poor in the order of AAA, AA+, AA, AA– A+, A, A–, B+, B, B– and C [133]. Table 1 depicts the rating grades, with corresponding score ranges. The rating is carried out every quarter, based on behavior data for market players in the most recent two years, with a 70% weight assigned to the current year and 30% to the previous year, attempting to incentivize sustainably good behavior. 3.8.3. Rating application
The rating results can have the following possible outcomes.
Warning. A warning would be issued to a market player whose rating falls to a grade B or below, and an alert would be issued to all players. Relevant parties that have contractual relations and economic contacts with the market player who rates a grade C would be officially informed, so that they could initiate risk prevention and control.
Risk prevention. The rating results link to credit limits and security deposits for market players, as a way to incentivize market compliance. In relation to a standard threshold deposit set by the government policy for retailers, the required security deposits for different ratings are listed in Table 2.
Control. The qualifications for bilateral contracts and contract transfers would be suspended for market players that rate a grade B. For those who rate a grade C, all transaction qualifications would be sus- pended in addition to a warning.
Joint punishment. A market player that rates a grade C would be included in a credit blacklist that is synchronously published on an official credit website (http://www.yncredit.gov.cn/). Joint punish- ment also would be initiated to compel withdrawal from the market.
Post-assessment and adjustment. The behavior of a market player who is subject to joint punishment would be recorded and subject to post-assessment and adjustment. A market player would enter an ob- servation period, given two successive ratings of a grade B. The rating of a market player who keeps a grade B throughout a year would be adjusted to a grade C. Proactively correcting and demonstrating co- operative behavior during the joint punishment period would be ben- eficial for the market player wishing to return to the market.
4. Practice and experience
Yunnan has played a leading role in exploring electricity market reforms in China, reflecting years of efforts [134,135]. Highly com- mented upon by central and local peers [114,136,137], the reform experiences of Yunnan have influenced central reform policies in the past few years [138,139]. Having reviewed in detail above the theory behind Yunnan’s reforms, this paper now turns to an examination of Yunnan’s experience with the practical implementation of the reforms.
4.1. Market construction and operation
Taking the first step in electricity market reform in mid-2014, Yunnan struggled to address the problem of hydropower surpluses and insufficient industrial utilization. The province developed a provincial market with a trading system of time-progressive, game-continuous, and multi-collaborative transactions, as illustrated in Fig. 12, and shaped the Yunnan model of medium- and long-term trading, supple- mented by short-term day-ahead trading, through years of reforms and policy trials [114,135,140,141]. As shown in Fig. 13, the electricity market sustained double-digit growth in trading volume for four con- secutive years, accounting for 51% of the provincial electricity con- sumption and ranking first in the country as of 2018 [142].
Fig. 14 shows that by the end of 2018, the number of market players reached 7662, more than 70 times that of 2014. With the participation of 443 power plants (whose aggregate installed capacity accounts for 76% of the total), 6527 industrial consumers, 582 commercial users with dedicated transformers, and 110 retailers, the market was thus well activated and energized, among the top markets in the country in terms of market player participation [135].
4.2. Stranded cost mitigation
As presented in Figs. 15 and 16, the eleven coal power plants under the dispatching jurisdiction of YNPG, all of which have suffered from sharp downturns in their capacity factors since the reforms, are now on the brink of insolvency due to the electricity market reform and pres- sures from overcapacity and RES integration. Plagued by incumbent debts and persistent losses associated with operation and maintenance at low capacity factors, these plants seem unlikely to be able to recover costs from generation revenues alone. Fortunately, the introduction of LTCPR remuneration to coal power plants in return for providing back- up capacity, which paid 2.37, 1.9 and 1.95 billion RMB in the most recent three years, respectively, lends great support to them in stopping their further losses associated with operation and maintenance, and thus has mitigated to some extent the problem of stranded costs under extreme low utilization levels.
4.3. Energy cost reduction
Through market reforms, electricity prices in Yunnan fell from the fourth-to-last to the next-to-last in the country (compared to pre-reform prices), resulting in significant energy cost reductions and over 30 billion RMB in benefits to electricity consumers [141]. Fig. 17 shows moderate energy price fluctuations, implying the seasonality of Yun- nan’s dominated hydropower and changes in demand and supply. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 18, provincial industrial utilization rises driven by energy cost reductions. For example, the average industrial utilization rate rose up to 61.4% in 2018, the highest level since the reforms. 4.4. Hydropower curtailment abatement
To comply with China’s commitments to carbon emissions reduc- tions and decarbonization targets, Yunnan devised specific trading rules to ensure RES integration as a matter of priority in market design. Moreover, as demonstrated in Fig. 19, motivated by the resurgence of the provincial industrial economy driven by electricity market reforms and the demand growth arising from the inter-provincial market me- chanism, Yunnan’s electricity production continued to increase for three successive years, achieving a double-digit growth of 10% in 2017 and a vigorous increase of 7% in 2018. Furthermore, as a result of broad coordination and efforts, Yunnan’s hydropower curtailment went through its (likely) turning point in 2016 and started to decline in the following two years. Therefore, hydropower curtailment has abated substantially in the most recent years.
4.5. Credit rating system
Based on the credit rating for retailers established earlier, Yunnan set up a credit rating system that covers all market players in associa- tion with the credit system of the People’s Bank of China to encourage interactive contributions of market players to the electricity market [144].
According to the completed credit rating analysis reports [132,145–147], the credit rating system focuses on market-related be- havior by market players and reflects the compliance and performance of market players in participating and interacting with the electricity market. Specifically, it covers warnings, transaction qualifications, and joint punishment, as well as post-assessment and adjustment; it estab- lishes an information exchange with the provincial credit sharing platform, guiding market players in improving market participation and interplay; and it sets up links to the bankable credit limits of market players to support the steady development of the electricity market.
4.6. Resource allocation optimization
While constructing the provincial market, Yunnan embarked on promoting the inter-provincial market as well, and achieved resource allocation across a larger geographical area with an inter-provincial trading model of plan + market that specifies energy exports in the WEET Framework Agreement under the 13th Five-Year Plan (the plan part) while striving for more exports via market mechanisms (the market part) [148]. Fig. 20 shows that Yunnan has exported over 550 TWh of electricity to the eastern provinces via WEET since the reforms. Energy exchanged via inter-provincial trading accounts for about 15% of the total WEET volume in the past five years, increasing the share of inter- provincial trading from 8% in 2014 to 19% in 2018. Despite the limited progress of the regional electricity market, the explored model of plan + market for inter-provincial trading preliminarily achieved re- source allocation across a broader area and supported the mutually beneficial development of the eastern and western regions. 4.7. Climate change mitigation
In advancing electricity market reforms, Yunnan adheres to the commitments pledged by the country to the international community and dedicates itself to the targets of carbon emissions reduction and non-fossil energy use by 2030. In 2016, Yunnan provided its residential customers with the first electric plan for energy substitution in the country, attempting to reduce primary energy use, such as firewood and coal [149]. Fig. 21 shows that the share of RESs in Yunnan's electricity production has been over 90% since 2016, enabling the province to exceed its 42% non-fossil energy use target by a large margin ahead of the established deadline [150].
More importantly, Yunnan’s massive RES deployment has not only improved its own energy mix significantly, but also has contributed remarkably to the low carbon development of the southeastern coastal areas. By feeding the southeastern load centers over 110 TWh every year, Yunnan shares clean energy with its energy-hungry southeast partners, commensurately reducing consumption of standard coal by 34 million tons and CO2 emissions by 89 million tons every year, according to the most recent figures [151–153]. Furthermore, this deployment also contributes notably to the country's efforts in mitigating climate change, reducing carbon intensity, and increasing the share of non- fossil energy use.
5. Challenges and policy implications
5.1. Mixed market
As an imperfectly competitive market, Yunnan is in the process of increasing marketization. Currently, imbalances between provincial priority generation and consumption lead to a mixed market with a dual-track system based on both government quotas and competitive market trading. The fact that the priority generation plan of a power plant is subject to a yearly goal and can be carried over between months adds a layer of complexity to power balancing. For example, it in- centivizes hydro plants with small reservoirs to maximize their use of market trading in the dry season, when the market energy price is re- latively high, to push their priority generation plans, with associated government-guaranteed prices, into the wet season, when the market energy price is undoubtedly lower, thus enabling these plants to profit while taking up market share during a period of likely overcapacity, reducing demand for the production of other plants that must rely on the market alone. Moreover, uncertainties about generation and load in a given month add another layer of complexity to delivering the rela- tively physical contracts and greatly complicate the iterations of power balancing calculations, the carrying-over goals of priority generation plans, and market settlements. From the perspective of promoting further marketization in the next step of reform, bid-based economic dispatch should be incorporated into the market model to improve efficiency. Continuing efforts should also be made in research and policy formulation for further reducing electricity generation and consumption plans in order to eliminate imbalances caused by the mixed market and to encourage more market allocation of resources.
5.2. Stranded costs
As described above, pressures from electricity market reforms, overcapacity, and RES integration have been squeezing generation demand for coal power plants and have consequently caused the utili- zation of coal power plants to hover at a level much lower than the nationwide average. Encumbered by high debts and low revenues, in- cumbent coal power plants seem unlikely to recover their costs through generation alone, although the uncertainty of a market dominated by hydropower, and dependent on precipitation, makes coal power plants necessary to serve as back-up supply in dry seasons or drought years. The proposed socialized LTCPR remuneration works to some extent to compensate coal plants for their idle capacity and remedy losses asso- ciated with operation and maintenance under low-capacity-factor generation scenarios. However, it seems unlikely that this will be an adequate cure for the longstanding stranded costs problem faced by coal plants. Market designs and rules appropriate for coal power plants participating in hydro-dominated electricity markets should be ex- plored for future study. More sophisticated capacity markets or pay- ments are likely to be the solution.
5.3. Policy inconsistencies
Motivated by the conflicts of demand and supply, Yunnan has es- tablished an essentially competitive market and has benefited from reforms in recent years. However, the multiple objectives of energy policy set at both the central and local levels sometimes introduce in- consistencies. For example, state regulation of electricity derivatives interferes with the coordination of medium- and long-term energy trading and system operation and the establishment of electricity spot markets, by preventing the development and use of the Financial Transmission Rights that are used to hedge against congestion costs in many electricity markets in other parts of the world. In addition, the lack of government inter-department coordination results in the paradox of some government departments merging corporations into new cartels while other departments are breaking the old monopolies into competitive pieces. Tax policy inconsistent with electricity mar- kets, which, for example, results in the inability of the grid company to provide invoices to retailers who are not the end consumers of elec- tricity, frustrates the electricity retail business and gives rise to un- necessary layers of complexity in energy trading and settlements. Disputes about how to allocate resources over a large geographical area and avoid local price volatility slow the development of a regional market. Electricity market reforms do not necessarily mean lower prices in all circumstances, and non-market interventions to address price volatility that may produce perverse incentives and further lead to obstacles to demand participation and investments to alleviate resource scarcity should not be the first choice [154]. The weakness of the in- dependent regulator and the absence of marginal-cost-based system operation are also obstacles to development of a fully efficient, com- petitive market. In addressing these problems, greater inter-agency collaboration and high-level coordination should be incorporated into the reform process to avoid policy proliferation and policy conflict at both the central and local levels.
5.4. Spot market: centralized or decentralized?
Prices that approximately reflect energy cost and value in the ongoing market provide signals for medium- and long-term electricity planning and operation, as well as investment. However, system op- eration based on a coarse balancing mechanism fails to allow for granular economic dispatch, encourage flexibility, and reflect accurate local price signals. Similarly, a system of dispatch that employs only cursory security checks in the dispatch process results in contract de- viations that produce complicated market settlements, discouraging demand-side participation in times of scarcity and dampening the market role in resource allocation.
Despite these problems, overall, Yunnan has developed an elec- tricity market with plenty of participants and well-built fundamentals, based on medium- and long-term trading supplemented by short-term day-ahead trading. Thus, the selection of a market model for the next stage of marketization appears to be the next question. A centralized spot market encourages the trades needed to support a market and the flexibility needed for system operation and thus improves market effi- ciency. However, it may challenge the delivery of relatively physical contracts and require related derivatives that are not currently allowed. A decentralized spot market does not alter physical contracts and can accommodate the ongoing medium- and long-term trading model well, but is faced with other challenges in terms of system flexibility and market efficiency. Therefore, more inter-department collaborations are required to promote the reforms toward an efficient spot market. More importantly, the pathway and model selection of spot market should also build on local conditions and market laws.
5.5. Regional coordination
The uneven distribution of resources and loads, along with the ever- increasing RES penetration, the multiplication of regional grid inter- connections, and growing commitments related to climate change, emissions reductions, and decarbonization give rise to the need for a common pathway in the form of a regional market capable of max- imizing social welfare, optimizing the energy mix and grid structure, and improving efficiency over a broader region. However, the viability of a regional market will be at risk if conflicts of interest across au- tonomous provinces in the region are not handled appropriately. Furthermore, inefficiencies resulting from the coexistence of the power exchange and power dispatch also require higher-level coordination at both regional and provincial levels. Moreover, regional and provincial markets should be compatible with each other in terms of market goals and designs in order to ensure both the coordinated operation and development of markets and better RES integration. To that end, the responsibilities and obligations of relevant departments, the regional market boundaries, and so on, should be explicit.
5.6. Electricity planning
Despite progress in electricity market reforms, as a result of the seasonality of hydropower, mismatches between power sources and grid development, and predicted electricity demand growth, it appears unlikely that Yunnan will be able to eliminate overcapacity and the resulting hydropower curtailment soon, a problem which results in a huge waste of clean energy, a particularly ironic situation, given China’s efforts to mitigate climate change. In light of the reality that massive clean energy in the southwest is distant from the eastern load centers, it is therefore necessary to take the country as a whole into consideration in electricity planning in order to coordinate the elec- tricity-related infrastructures across different regions centrally, strengthen control over coal-based power sources in eastern areas, and thus promote clean energy integration over larger areas. Moreover, given the geographical advantages, it is also important for Yunnan to consolidate its current electric connections with Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos; facilitate future interconnections with more south Asian countries; and promote regional energy trade coordination and re- source allocation over an even larger area to further unlock Yunnan’s tremendous renewable potential.
5.7. Carbon market
To address the problems of degraded air quality and climate change, in 2017, China officially launched a national carbon market covering emitters across the electricity sector [155]. However, carbon emission permits are distributed to generators for free [156], which runs con- trary to internalizing externalities, such as the cost of carbon emissions, for the WEET-importing provinces. As a result, the WEET-receiving areas have reduced incentives to accept additional clean energy. As much an economic strategy as an environmental policy, the carbon market has not yet linked with the electricity market to quickly facil- itate further consumption of clean energy.
Nevertheless, China's commitment to the international community remains unchanged. It is projected that China’s share of coal-based generation will fall below 40% by 2040 [157], giving rise to more RES deployment such that the country can adjust its energy consumption structure cost-effectively in the foreseeable future. As a consequence, it is urgent for China to promote policies related to leveraging the southwestern renewable advantages and encouraging more clean en- ergy consumption in transitioning to clean and sustainable develop- ment. Specifically, strengthening the linkage between carbon and electricity markets by incorporating carbon emissions into electricity pricing is likely to incentivize more demand for Yunnan’s renewable energy, and thus contribute more to mitigating climate change and reducing renewable curtailment.
6. Conclusions
Under the framework of central reforms, Yunnan actively trans- formed the top-level reform initiative into concrete plans, established the first and the only power exchange in which the grid company does not hold the majority of the shares, and is one of the leaders thus far in China in facilitating openness, fairness and transparency for electricity market reforms.
After five years of exploration and reforms, Yunnan has developed replicable reform experiences widely recognized as models by both central and local levels of government, generated significant social benefits, and achieved tangible results in the following ways: i) Yunnan took the lead in the country in examining and approving transmission and distribution prices for the supervision period of 2016–2018, re- vealing the true costs of the grid company and cutting 3 billion RMB from the costs of YNPG; ii) Yunnan built an electricity market char- acterized by medium- and long-term trading, supplemented by short- term day-ahead trading, and kept improving market rules and enriching market transactions to encourage more participation and expand trading volume and to mitigate stranded costs and abate hydropower curtailment; iii) Yunnan was the first province in the country to largely reduce government quotas and incorporate all industrial consumers and power sources, including wind and solar power, into the electricity market; iv) Yunnan established a standard procedure for market entry and exit to level the playing field; v) Yunnan was the first province in the country to implement a credit rating system in the electricity market that applies to all market players, and to form a set of credit indices and a rating system to sustain market order; and (vi) Yunnan expanded clean energy exports via an inter-provincial trading me- chanism to facilitate resource allocation over a broader region and support the eastern coastal areas in mitigating climate change.
Regardless of the achievements, many challenges remain. Both centrally and locally, more effort and additional reforms are required to facilitate the transition from coal-heavy electricity generation to a more efficient, flexible, and low-carbon market system. In a market with high RES penetration that is plagued by hydropower curtailment, it is in- dispensable for Yunnan to keep improving market design and rules in order to accommodate multiple reform objectives, strengthening the market’s contribution to resource allocation, RES integration, miti- gating stranded costs, and addressing climate change. Specifically, bid- based, security-constrained economic dispatch with LMP and financial contracts, a capacity market or payments, and more interaction with a carbon market should be considered in future research.

24,Measurement of the direct rebound effect of residential electricity consumption: An empirical study based on the China family panel studies,"The rebound effect is a potential threat to energy efficiency related policies to save energy. Based on data from China family panel studies over the period 2010–2018, this paper measures the energy efficiency and direct rebound effect of residential electricity consumption by using the stochastic energy demand frontier model. The result shows that the average value of efficiency is 0.491, and the average rebound effect is 48%. It means that there is still room for improvement in China’s household electricity consumption efficiency. But the expected electricity- saving after improving efficiency can only achieve 52%. Besides, we find that electricity price and household size have a negative impact on the rebound effect, while the impact of income is inverted U-shaped. Finally, the rebound effect varies between before and after the implementation of the increasing block pricing policy, considering rural and urban residents and different regions. These findings provide some policy implications for the residential electricity pricing system under the background of energy conservation and climate change.","1. Introduction
China’s electricity consumption has been increasing with the eco- nomic development in recent decades. According to the National Energy Administration, China’s total electricity consumption has increased from 4.19 trillion kWh in 2010 to 7.23 trillion kWh in 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 6.28%. Among them, the residential electricity consumption increased from 512.5 billion kWh in 2010 to 1.025 trillion kWh in 2019, and the average annual growth rate is 8.05%. With the advancement of China’s urbanization, electricity will replace traditional energy continuously, and residential electricity consumption is expected to continue growing [1–3]. Saving electricity has become one of the main goals of China’s electricity market reform. The Chinese government has made many efforts to promote electricity efficiency such as, improving energy efficiency standards, subsidizing home appliances, and reforming the electricity price mechanisms. However, the energy rebound effect is potentially threatening energy- saving targets which are based on energy efficiency improvements [4–7].
Rebound effect refers to the phenomenon that partial or complete offset may reduce energy consumption by improving energy efficiency, and the proportion of the offset part to the potential energy saving is the rebound effect. The mechanism is that the improvement of energy effi- ciency will reduce the energy consumption per unit as well as the price of energy so that the potential energy savings can be partially or completely offset by the substitution effect, income effect and output effect [8,9]. Many pieces of research investigated the scale of the rebound effect and their findings show that it varied in different energy consumption sectors in many developed countries [10–12]. China is no exception as the largest energy consumer group. However, the existing studies have measured the energy rebound effect of the industrial sectors in China, and there is little research on residential energy consumption, especially on residential electricity consumption [13–15]. The main reason is that the micro-data is difficult to obtain [16].
Besides, there are some deficiencies in the existing measurement methods of the energy rebound effect at the residential level in China. In principle, it is necessary to estimate the elasticity of energy services to energy efficiency to measure the rebound effect. Since energy efficiency is difficult to obtain, most literature estimate the rebound effect by estimating the price elasticity of the energy demand. However, such methods also have two limitations. The first is the symmetry assump- tion, which means that consumers react to energy efficiency improve- ment and energy price decline in the same way. That is to say, when the energy efficiency increases by 1%, the energy price will decrease by 1%. Thus, many studies adopt price elasticity or use proxies of changes in energy efficiency to estimate rebound effects for simplification. These studies assume that the impact of energy efficiency improvement and energy price decline on consumers is consistent, which is unrealistic [17]. The second is the exogenous assumption, that is, energy efficiency has no change regardless of any changes in energy prices [10]. This assumption is too strict. For instance, residents will turn to more energy- efficient products when the energy price is high, which can help resi- dents to save a lot of energy expenditure.
Therefore, given China’s huge electricity market, measuring the rebound effect and finding its influencing factors by using a more precise approach is essential for assessing the effectiveness of energy policies aimed at improving energy efficiency. Further, since China maps a vast territory, and the energy consumption characteristics of urban and rural residents vary in different regions. Thus, these differences need to be considered to optimize future energy efficiency policies on the residents. Using a micro panel data set of China family panel studies (CFPS) over the period 2010–2018, we investigate the extents and determinants of Chinese residential electricity demand and direct rebound effect through the frontier model of stochastic energy demand. This paper contributes to the existing studies in the following three ways.
Firstly, this paper uses the stochastic energy demand frontier model to estimate the direct rebound effect of China’s electricity consumption, which is more reliable than the existing research. On the one hand, we use Orea et al. [10] model for the first time to investigate the rebound effect of China’s residential electricity consumption, which eliminates the limitations of price elasticity substitution and other methods and improves the estimation accuracy. On the other hand, we focus on the rebound effect of household electricity consumption, rather than the overall rebound effect of all household energy consumption in K. Du et al. [7], which avoids the estimation bias caused by the substitution effect between different energy sources.
Second, we measure the electricity rebound effect of China’s resident sector for the first time by using the largest household sample available. Since we can control many household characteristics, the determinants of electricity demand and the rebound effect among residents in China can be identified. Based on such methods, we can provide precise policy reference for effectively mitigating the rebound effect and promoting energy conservation in China and other developing countries.
Thirdly, this paper compares the different types of energy efficiency and rebound effect of residents in different periods, which has a certain reference value for China and other developing countries. On the one hand, China’s residential electricity price system can not adapt to the rapidly changing economic situation. As a key factor affecting energy consumption, electricity price has a strong impact on energy efficiency and rebound effect. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the char- acteristics of residents’ electricity consumption under different elec- tricity price systems. On the other hand, the characteristics of household 
energy consumption are different not only between both urban and rural areas but also at the regional level. For example, the energy consump- tion of residents in the western region of China is lower than that in the eastern region, and the energy consumption level of rural residents in China is far lower than that of urban residents due to their low income and insufficient social security system. However, it is unclear whether there are differences between energy efficiency and rebound effect of different types of residents.
We organize the remaining parts of this paper as follows: previous studies are briefly reviewed in Section 2; Section 3 introduces the survey data; the empirical strategy is presented in Section 4; Section 5 discusses the results; the final section concludes.
2. Literature review
The rebound effect widely exists in energy consumption behavior, and the measurement of the rebound effect is the focal points of related research. Many pieces of literature explore different types of rebound effects in different economic levels such as countries, regions, industrial sectors, and households. In general, the rebound effect can be classified as three: the direct effect, indirect effect, and economy-wide effect ac- cording to its production mechanism [18,19]. The first is the direct energy rebound effect, which refers to the increase in the efficiency of certain energy service, leading to a reduction in the cost of energy ser- vices and an increase in the demand for energy [17]. The second is the indirect energy rebound effect that refers to the reduction of one certain energy service cost, causing the demand for other energy services to increase [20]. Third, the economy-wide energy rebound effect includes direct energy rebound effects and indirect energy rebound effects [21–23], which is achieved through macroeconomic price and growth effects [19]. Prices affect market adjustments and lead to lower energy prices in responding to a new balance of energy efficiency improvements [4]. Based on these definitions, the existence of the rebound effect is widely accepted, but its size is disputed. Generally, there are five classes of the energy rebound effect according to the value of rebound effect, including backfire effect (R greater than 1), full rebound (R = 1), partial rebound (0 < R < 1), zero rebounds (R = 0) , and super conservation effect (R < 0) [24,25].
Since our paper focused on residential electricity demand, we pay attention mainly to the papers on household energy demand. From the perspective of residential electricity consumption, Hsueh and Gerner [26] find that the rebound effect of U.S. residential electricity con- sumption was 35% by using a cross-sectional data set of 253 households. Jin [27] estimates that the long-term and short-term rebound effects of Korean residential electricity consumption in 2002 were 30% and 38% respectively by using the price elasticity between efficiency and con- sumption. Orea et al. [10] use the stochastic energy demand frontier model for the first time and found that the overall rebound effect of the US residential sector from 1995 to 2001 was 56%-80%. Chitnis and Sorrell [11] base their estimates on cross-price elasticities, utilising a multiregional input–output model, and find that in the UK, the overall rebound effect of measures to improve domestic natural gas use effi- ciency was 41%, the rebound effect of electricity use was 48%, and the rebound effect of vehicle fuel was 78%. It can be found that except for Orea et al. [10], most literature found that the rebound effect of resi- dential electricity consumption in developed countries is between 30 and 50%.
While there may be other reasons for the need for energy (electricity) efficiency in an economy such as China, many studies have found that the rebound effect of residential electricity consumption is between 50 and 80%, much higher than that of developed countries. Lin and Liu [28] estimated the impact of electricity price adjustment on the rebound effect of urban residential housing by establishing the linear approxi- mation of the approximate ideal demand system (LA-AIDS) model, finally found that the rebound effect after the increasing block pricing reform dropped from 165.22% to 132.3%. Besides, Wang et al. [13] analyzed the panel data from 30 provinces for 15 years by using co- integration equations and panel error correction models, and find that the rebound effect of electricity consumption in China’s urban residents is expected to be 74% in the long-term and 72% in the short-term. Additionally, according to the analysis of environmental energy input and output in seven sectors, Wang et al. [14] estimated the rebound effect of residential electricity consumption in Beijing is 46–56% in the long-term and 24%-37% in the short-term. Considering income level, Zhang and Peng [15] find that the direct rebound effect in the low- income (67.9%) is much greater than that in the high-income(54.7%) in China. Su [29] used the survey data of 7,677 households from 2014 to 2017 in Taiwan through a right-skewed regression model to find that the rebound effect was 72% for air conditioning, 70% for refrigerators,11% for lighting, and 3% for TV. Zhao and Li [30] construct two models, the panel linear model, and the panel threshold model, to analyze the direct rebound effect of residential electricity consumption. The research conclusion is that the rebound effect of Chinese residential electricity use is 84.94% on average, and the rebound effect of low-income areas and high population areas is greater.
For other energy consumption behavior, Sorrell et al. [18] find that the rebound effect for household heating usually ranges from 10 to 58% in the short-term and from 1.4 to 60% in the long-term. Aydin et al. [31] employ a quasi-experimental approach based on a sample of 563,000 households in the Netherlands to investigate the rebound effect in res- idential heating, and the results show a rebound effect of 26.7% among homeowners, and 41.3% among tenants. Belaïd et al. [32] find that the direct rebound effect in residential gas demand is approximately 53% in the short-run and approximately 60% in the long-run in France through the standard OLS regression and autoregressive distributed lag cointe- gration (ARDL) approach. Moshiri and Aliyev [33] estimate the rebound effect for personal transportation in Canada by using AIDS and QUAIDS models based on a survey data set, and the results show a rather high average rebound effect of 82–88% but with significant heterogeneity across income groups, provinces, and gasoline prices. Barkhordar [34] finds that the average economy-wide rebound was 43.8% of an LED Replacement Lamps Program which executed in Iran households through a hybrid dynamic general equilibrium model. Freire-Gonz ́alez [35] finds that the average rebound effect in households for the overall EU-27 economy is between 73.62% and 81.16% by using a hybrid methodology that combines econometric estimates, environmental extended input–output analysis and re-spending models.
Regarding the energy demand of China’s residential sector, only a few studies take account of the energy rebound effect. Sun [36] finds a negative direct rebound effect for dishwashers and a potentially positive direct rebound effect for air conditioners in the Energy Star program which aimed at improving the energy efficiency of household appliances in China. Liu et al. [37] introduce a life cycle based method to estimate the rebound effect of Chinese room air conditioners (RACs) consump- tion and find that the life cycle rebound effect was 67%. Lin and Liu [28] establish the LA-AIDS model to estimate the size of energy rebound for passenger transportation of Chinese urban residents and find a ‘backfire effect’, i.e. 107.2%. Q. Du et al. [38] find that the magnitudes of the rebound effect for residential buildings in urban areas fluctuate between 79.43% and 110.00% by employing the linear approximation of the Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model, while that in rural areas increase from 115.28% to 120.40% over the period 1994–2016 in China. Ouyang et al. [39] find a high rebound effect of at least 30% in China, however, the result is presumed by reference to the rebound effects of other countries. Wen et al. [40] find that the direct energy rebound ef- fect of each province in China ranges from 14.12% to 19.98% by combining econometric methods, the input–output analysis and the re- spending model.
K. Du et al. [7] apply the stochastic energy demand frontier model put forward by Orea et al. (2015) to measure the rebound effect of Chinese residents for the first time, and find that the rebound effect varies across regions, with an average of 65.4% using a panel data set of 0 Chinese provincial-level regions. However, some questions are worth further study based on their paper. Firstly, they calculate the overall rebound effect of China’s household-level energy consumption, including coal, gasoline, electricity, heat, etc. This result ignores the substitution effect between different kinds of energy, which may lead to bias of the rebound effect of single energy (such as electricity con- sumption). Secondly, they only studied the rebound effect of urban residents in China. There are great differences in economic development level, per capita income, climate environment and living habits among different regions in China, and there are also great differences in household energy consumption characteristics of urban and rural resi- dents in the same region. Therefore, it is of great significance to inves- tigate and compare the electricity consumption characteristics of urban and rural residents for optimizing energy efficiency policies. Finally, they use regional aggregate data set instead of micro-survey data set, which cannot control some household characteristics when estimating power demand, which decreases the reliability of estimation.
From the above literature, we can find that different definitions of rebound effect can lead to different calculation methods. Furthermore, the rebound effect results calculated by different literature are quite different, even if the research object is for the same energy consumption sector in the same country. The main reason for this status quo is that there is currently no consistent method for measuring rebound effects [17]. Moreover, the existing measurement methods are biased to some extent. Fortunately, the method Orea et al. [10] put forward can solve this problem very well, through which the rebound effect can be directly estimated from the change in energy demand elasticity relative to the level of energy efficiency. In summary, how to calculate the rebound effect more accurately based on the definition of the rebound effect is the essential question in the current rebound effect research.
3. Methodology
In this paper, we use a stochastic energy demand frontier model that was first put forward by Filippini and Hunt [41,42] and adapted by Orea et al. [10] for directly estimating the energy rebound effect. In the sto- chastic frontier analysis (SFA) framework, we define energy efficiency as: where q is the observed energy consumption, X is a set of control variables that determine the optimal energy demand, β is a vector of the parameters to be estimated and f (X, β) is the frontier that represents optimal energy demand. The error term in Eq. (1) thereby comprises two independent parts. ν is the conventional random noise term that is assumed to follow a normal distribution, i.e.,ν ∼ N(0, σ2ν ); The term u denotes the energy inefficiency component that follows a half-normal distribution, i.e.,μ ∼ N+(0, σ2μ). The identification of these error terms relies on the one-sided distribution of u. Specifically, the energy effi- ciency level can be written as follows: where the range of energy efficiency is 0 < e⩽1, and e = 1 indicates that energy has been used at the optimal level, i.e., there is no energy inefficiency.
Following Orea et al. [10], we modify Eq. (1) to incorporate rebound effects in an SFA framework. The rebound effect has different mathe- matical definitions. In this paper, we use the definition of Saunders [24], in which the rebound R is defined as: where εe(q) is the elasticity of energy demand with respect to energy efficiency improvement and can be written as follows: However, Orea et al. [10] remind that εe (q) = − 1 in the standard stochastic energy demand frontier presented by Eq. (1) since the energy efficiency improvement reduces energy demand proportionally, which means that the rebound effect is zero. To solve this problem, they add a correction factor (1 − R) interacting with the energy inefficiency term u. This can be defined as: For model specification, the value of R is restricted to be less than one
which enables us to distinguish between the normally distributed term ν and the half-normal distributed term u. This restriction precludes the occurrences of the full-rebound and backfire rebound effects.
In Eq. (5), both R and u are unobservable, which makes the equation impossible to estimate. To solve this problem, Orea et al. [10] assumed that the rebound effect is determined by some covariates. Eq. (5) is further re-written as: where R(γ’z) is the rebound effect function; z is a vector of the var- iables that determine the rebound effect level; and γ’ is a vector of the corresponding coefficients. In this way, the energy efficiency and rebound effect can be simultaneously obtained by estimating the sto- chastic energy demand frontier model. To estimate the above model by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Orea et al. [10] suggested two kinds of functional forms for R(γ’z): Eq. (7) restricts 0 < R < 1, which indicates a partially rebound ef- fect. In this case, it is termed the PA function. Eq. (8) allows that R is less than zero, indicating that the supper conservation is possible. This case is termed the SC function. Orea et al. [10] concluded that the PA func- tion is preferred because it can preclude abnormal outcomes. Therefore, we employ the PA function in this study.
Based on Eq. (6), we construct the residential electricity demand frontier function. According to relevant literature, residential electricity consumption is mainly affected by electricity price, household income, household population and climatic conditions. Assuming that the elec- tricity demand function is the Cobb-Douglas demand function, the model in Eq. (6) can be expressed as: where i and t represent province and year, respectively; q is actual electricity consumption,p denotes energy price, which is theoretically the most fundamental driving force of the energy demand change [42]; inc is residents’ income, which determines residents’ purchasing power regarding energy services and other goods; size is household size, and a larger family implies a larger house area which needs much energy to cool off or to heat the house, but it also may imply an intensive and efficient use of energy; area represents the housing area; coerepresent the energy type of cooking, coeequal to 1 means that residents using electricity to cook, equal to 0 means that they using other fuels such as natural gas for cooking. Since several studies show that there is a non- linear relationship between temperature changes and electricity de- mand, that is, when the temperature is high (low), because of the need for cooling (heating), the electricity demand increases with the increase (decrease) of the temperature. Thus, heating and cooling degree days (hdd and cdd) are also incorporated into the equation to characterize temperature changes. We also control the unobserved regional hetero- geneities towards a vector of dummy variables Dr according to the classification of the “Eight Integrated Economic Zones” issued by the Development Research Center of the State Council of China. Dt is the vector of the time dummy variable, which is used to control the unob- servable individual effects that change over time.
Regarding the rebound-effect function, we model γ′ z as a function of potential determinants of households’ energy demand, such as house- hold size, per capita income, and the electricity price. Specifically, we assume the following relationship. Different from Orea et al. [10], we also include the square term of the income level in Eq. (10), which can capture the potential nonlinear relationship between the income level and the rebound effect. As K. Du et al. [7], the response of low-income and high-income families to the improvement of energy efficiency is different. For example, the increase in electricity consumption by purchasing new power equipment, which is called the “extensive effect”, is likely to decrease after reaching a certain income level. 4. Data
The Institute of Social Science Survey at Peking University launched the China family panel studies in 2010. The data are representative of China’s situation because it covers 25 of China’s 33 provinces. While the frequency of its survey is once every two years, the targeted subjects of the survey are Chinese communities, families and individuals. It can reflect China’s economic and demographic characteristics, including education, immigration, employment, health, and other major economic behaviors. This survey brings abundant interesting information about China at the household level and has been utilized in many studies including estimating household energy efficiency [43] and measuring the impact of multidimensional energy poverty on health [44].
To our knowledge, the CFPS data for household electricity con- sumption is currently the largest publicly available dataset in China when compared to other data. For example, the sample size of the “Chinese Resident Energy Consumption Survey” (CRECS) initiated by the Renmin University of China is much smaller, and it is not a longi- tudinal survey [45]. Therefore, CFPS is the most useful database to help us study the micro-level related issues of Chinese families. We hereby using unbalanced panel data from 2010 to 2018 with a total of 14,437 individual households (across 9 years) and 52,749 observations. Among all households, 6,133 spans all five surveys and 2,274 households appear in only one.
CFPS does not contain temperature data, so we obtain temperature data from the CEIC database to construct hdd and cdd variables. When calculating hdd and cdd, daily temperature data is required typically. However, this paper uses monthly data to calculate the deviation of the temperature from the comfort zone, given that the daily temperature data in China is not easily available [16]. Following Li et al. [16], the comfort zone ranging between 18 ◦C and 27 ◦C , and the hdd and cdd are defined as follows: We match the annual hdd and cdd of each province to their residents. The descriptive statistics of all variables are shown in Table 1.
We also analyzed the trend of the above variables from 2010 to 2018. As shown in Fig. 1, the monthly electricity consumption increased from 81 kWh in 2010 to 195 kWh, with an increased rate of more than 100%. The growth of electricity price is slow, except for the big increase caused by China’s implementation of increasing block pricing (IBP) policy in 2012. The average household income increased rapidly from 2868 yuan/month to 4974 yuan/month. However, the growth of residential housing areas is slightly slow, with an increase of only about 15 square meters in eight years respectively. Family size showed a small fluctua- tion trend that stabilized at about 3.85 people per household. The pro- portion of residents using electricity for cooking has gradually increased, from 10.5% in 2010 to 22.3%. This may be the result of the urbanization of many rural populations since electricity replaces most solid fuels. In terms of climate variables, the temperature fluctuation at the provincial level is small.
5. Results and discussion
5.1. Estimates of the econometric models
In this part, we estimate the stochastic energy demand frontier model. By comparison, Table 2 gives the estimation results of the ALS and the PA model, and the difference is that the ALS model lacks the term [1 − R(γ’ z). We find that the coefficients of some variables between “ALS” and “PA” are different, indicating the fact that neglecting the rebound effect can lead to significantly biased estimates [7]. Thus, we analyze the estimation results of the PA model in detail below.
As for the frontier of energy demand, the estimation coefficient of electricity price is significantly negative, indicating that the rise in en- ergy prices can reduce energy demand in China’s residential sector. The estimated value of the coefficient also shows that the electricity demand is elastic. This finding is different from that of developed economies [10]. The possible reason is that the electricity demand of Chinese res- idents has not reached the saturation point like that of developed countries, and the electricity demand caused by household electrical appliances purchase is still rising, so the price elasticity is relatively large at this stage.
It can also be seen that residential electricity demand is income- inelastic, with an elasticity of around 0.368 and statistically signifi- cant at the 1% level. This finding is in line with most related studies [10,42]. The estimated coefficient of lnsize suggests that the family size has a positive impact on electricity consumption. Since China’s house- hold size is larger than that of developed countries, and grandparents are usually live together with their sons or daughters to take care of their grandchildren [7], the more population, the more likely it is to produce a scale effect. However, it may be due to the low efficiency of China’s residential electricity consumption that this scale effect does not appear.
The positive coefficient of housing area shows that the larger the area, the more electricity is consumed, which adheres to common sense that more rooms require more electrical equipment, such as electric lights and air conditioning. Since the electricity consumption of cooking appliances such as induction cooker and rice cooker is high, the dummy variable of cooking with electricity or not is significantly positive, and the electricity consumption is higher than that of other households using fuel. Moreover, the coefficient of lncdd and lnhdd are both significantly positive at the level of 1%, which means that the weather is too hot or too cold, which will encourage residents to increase their electricity consumption. Regarding the rebound effect function, the coefficient of lnp is significantly negative at the 1% level, indicating that energy prices can not only affect the residents’ electricity demand in general but also can abate the energy rebound effect. Given the energy market imperfection due to the price distortion in current China, there are still quite a few things to be changed in the formation process of energy price. Hence, we can expect energy prices to play a vital role in mitigating the rising energy demand, with the ongoing energy price reform [7].
Besides, the coefficients of lninc are significantly positive, however, the coefficients of its quadratic term are significantly negative, indi- cating an inverted U-shaped relationship between rebound-effect size and income level. In other words, before the income level reaches a certain turning point, the rebound effect can increase with the rise in income level and then can decrease with the growth of income after that point. This may explain why the previous studies have concluded that the rebound effect of high-income groups is smaller than that of low- income groups.
The coefficient of the third variable, household size, is negative. This result can be reasonably explained. Compared with a small family, households with more members have stronger intense, motivation of saving energy is probably because saving energy can bring a larger overall benefit, which leads to the rebound effect decline. This finding is also in line with Orea et al. [10] who use the city-level data.
5.2. Estimated electricity efficiency and rebound effect
Based on the above estimation results, Table 3 further shows the summary statistics of electricity efficiency scores and the rebound effect. The energy efficiency score is calculated based on the prediction of the composite error. If there is a separate intercept in Eq. (10), the model cannot be estimated because this intercept and the variance parameter in the inefficiency term cannot be identified simultaneously. Therefore, in addition to the estimation results of whether contains the intercept term, we also present the measurement results of the intercept term substitution by using the estimated intercept result of the ALS model. According to Orea et al. [10], efficiency with no intercept and no adjustment represent the upper bound and lower bound of energy effi- ciency estimates, respectively. Hence, we focus on the ALS-adjusted result since it properly adjusts the intercept term. In this study, the average energy efficiency score is 0.491. The standard deviation is 0.108, and the min and max values are 0.045 and 0.841, respectively, indicating the huge differences in energy efficiency among different
households in China.
Similarly, we list three types of rebound-effect estimation results
according to three types of efficiency values. We mainly focus on the rebound effect calculated based on adjustment of intercept, and the mean value is 48%, which is a reasonable one, i.e. smaller than 72% of Zhang and Peng [15] and bigger than 24%-37% of Wang et al. [14]. However, this result is slightly lower than the rebound effect of 65.4% of all household energy consumption estimated by K. Du et al. [7]. The main reason is that their data period is before 2014 when the income of Chinese residents was relatively low, so the rebound effect was higher. Besides, the rebound effects with no intercept and with no adjustment of intercept are 46.1% and 51.7%, respectively, which represent the lower bound and upper bound of the energy efficiency estimates. This part discusses the possible heterogeneity of electricity efficiency and rebounds effect, including the comparison of before and after the reform of increasing block pricing, urban and rural residents, and resi- dents in different provinces.
First of all, since our sample data period is from 2010 to 2018, China implemented the increasing block electricity pricing instead of the uniform pricing in all provinces in the mainland except Xinjiang and Tibet in July 2012. The reform aims to improve efficiency and promote equity and energy conservation through price mechanisms. Recalling the coefficient estimation results above (Table 2), the price has a significantly negative impact on the electricity demand and its rebound effect. Therefore, it is expected that the electricity efficiency and rebound effect before and after the block electricity price reform is likely to be quite different.
As shown in Table 4, the residential electricity efficiency after the IBP reform is 0.529, which only improves by 0.057, but the rebound effect reduces by 25.8% to 33.7%, nearly a half. It can be seen that price rise has a greater impact on the rebound effect, which reveals again that energy price reform is likely to be the most powerful means to reduce the rebound effect. Furthermore, China’s IBP reform in 2012 only raised the electricity prices for residents whose consumption exceeds the first block, with an average increase of only about 2.25%1. The further re- form of the residential electricity price system in China, the greater the energy-saving potential in raising the residential electricity price.
Next, given the unique urban–rural dual structure of China, we further compare and analyze the electricity efficiency and rebound ef- fect of rural and urban residents since their possible differences in consumption characteristics. Compared with rural residents, China’s urban residents who have higher economic income tend to increase electricity demand. In our sample, the average monthly electricity consumption of urban residents is 166.69 kWh, which is 57.89 kWh higher than that of rural residents2. However, there is a still small dif- ference between urban and rural residents in terms of efficiency and rebound effect, which are 0.043 and 0.015 higher for rural residents than those for urban residents, respectively (Table 4). This may be caused by rural residents having a strong sense of electricity saving. However, with the increase of income, rural residents purchase of household appliances increases rapidly, leading to a high rebound effect of electricity consumption. When household income rises to a higher level and electricity consumption reaches relative saturation, the rebound effect is likely to decline.
Finally, we compare the efficiency and rebound effect in different provinces. As shown in Fig. 2, the 50 percentiles of efficiency and rebound effect are respectively used as the limits to compare the dif- ferences among different provinces. According to this, we can propose more precise measures. Since an effective energy policy should improve energy efficiency and reduce the rebound effect, the provinces in the first three quadrants should be given more attention. In particular, provinces from quadrant II should be targeted for improving energy efficiency and reducing the rebound effects since their low energy effi- ciency and the high rebound effect. For the provinces from quadrant I, emphasis should be placed on reducing the rebound effect. Provinces from quadrant III should be placed with greater emphasis on energy efficiency. In short, a sound energy policy should be adapted for local conditions in different regions.
5.4. Robustness checks
In this section, we test the robustness of the above results. As shown in Table 5, the estimated results have eliminated the data of families that are either not continuously tracked (Panel A) or self-employed house- holds that use electricity for production or business (Panel B). We exclude households without continuous tracing to avoid the occasion- ality of these samples. The reason why we put forward the households that use electricity for production and business is that the purpose of daily use of electricity is different from that of production. The daily use of electricity is to meet the needs of normal life such as lighting and refrigeration, while that of the production is to make profits. Therefore, the influencing factors are quite different.
As shown in Table 5, the regression results of the two models are consistent with our expectations, and almost all of them are statistically significant, which proves the robustness of the above-mentioned. Furthermore, we also calculate the electricity efficiency and the rebound effect according to the estimated results, and the results are shown in Table 6.
In Table 6, we can see that there are almost no changes in both ef- ficiency scores and rebound effects by using a balanced panel dataset, indicating that the removed samples do not affect the regression results. However, after electricity consumption is removed from production and business, the efficiency increases to 0.779, and the rebound effect has little change. The possible reason is that households that use electricity for production and business are constrained by production conditions, so they cannot adjust their production behaviors and electricity con- sumption behaviors on time, thus resulting in lower electricity effi- ciency. Generally speaking, the above results prove the robustness of the stochastic energy demand frontier model.
6. Conclusions and policy implications
As the largest electricity consumer group, the growing electricity consumption of residents has brought great pressure on China’s energy supply and climate change. The rebound effect is a potential threat for the energy-efficiency driven energy-saving policies. Based on a panel dataset of 52,749 households in China, this paper investigates the electricity efficiency and rebound effect in the residential sector using a stochastic energy demand frontier model and analyzes the differences in time and region dimension. The conclusions are as follows.
Firstly, there is a large degree of non-efficiency and rebound effect in the electricity consumption of Chinese residents. The average value of electricity efficiency is 0.491, and the average rebound effect is 48%. This suggests that there is still plenty of room for efficiency improve- ment among Chinese households, and the rebound effect could offset nearly half of the expected energy savings, which caused by improve- ment of efficiency.
Secondly, energy price, households’ income, temperature, household size, household area, and cooking energy type are significant influencing factors of residential electricity consumption. As for the rebound effect function, we find that electricity price and household size have a negative impact on the rebound effect, while the impact of income has inverted U-shaped relation.
Finally, after the IBP reform in 2012, the electricity efficiency of residents has improved, and the rebound effect has reduced by nearly half. The efficiency and rebound effect of rural residents’ electricity consumption are higher than those of urban residents. There are also great differences in electricity efficiency and rebound effect among different provinces.
Some policy recommendations can be proposed based on the above findings.
First, different measures should be taken for residents with different electricity efficiency and rebound effect. For instance, the government should focus their energy and environmental policies on areas with low energy efficiency and high rebound effect, and it should also place attention not merely on increasing energy efficiency, but also the improvement of household appliance products’ energy efficiency to further reduce the rebound effect, conserve more energy, and make fewer emissions.
Second, among all policy tools, energy pricing reform may be the most helpful one to reduce the rebound effect. The estimated results show that energy price change has a significant negative effect on electricity consumption and rebound effect, which is also demonstrated by the reduction of rebound effect after the IBP reform. Especially, the reform of residential electricity price systems should consider the dif- ferences between urban and rural residents, such as setting different prices and lengths on each block for urban and rural residents. There- fore, with the further marketization of the electricity system, we expect that energy price changes can have a mitigating effect on energy demand in the long term.
Third, the Chinese governments should enhance residents’ aware- ness of energy conservation and environmental protection to cope with the inevitable rebound effect in the current development stage. Besides, the government should increase the popularity of smart meters to improve residents’ correct cognition of electricity consumption and real- time electricity price. China is still in the process of urbanization, household income continues to increase, resulting in a more diversified demand for electricity. Therefore, the government should strengthen the awareness education of energy-saving for all people to promote their self-conservation.

25,Nexus between energy efficiency and electricity reforms: A DEA-Based way forward for clean power development,"Energy is the key factor in economic growth and reforms are a means to improve energy efficiency, reduce its intensity, and decrease its per-unit cost. Therefore, the role of energy reforms has increased significantly after globalization, which directly affects local industries due to inefficiencies in their production, to the ultimate detriment of local consumers. To understand the impact of energy reforms on energy efficiency, this study used a dataset collected from forty-eight countries in five different regions. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the difference-in-difference (DID) method were used to view the impact of energy reforms. According to the DEA results, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Singapore perform poorly in the improvement of energy efficiency due to reforms, while Uzbekistan is the lowest performing country in this regard. The DID results show that Sub-Saharan Africa has seen improved performance after implementing energy reform in the region. These outcomes confirm that energy reform can be a good means to achieve a high level of energy efficiency and reduce the per-unit energy cost. The results show a 13.2% improvement in energy efficiency after electricity reforms. Based on the empirical results, this study identifies certain policy implications.","1. Introduction
Rapid industrial development and globalization in the modern era have caused a continuous increase in the global economic output. The world’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was 2.47% in 2019, down from 2.87% in 2015 (World Bank, 2019). Electricity and fossil fuel consumption (i.e., energy consumption) is a key factor in determining output growth. According to IEA (2018), global energy demand increased by 2.1% in 2017 as compared to a 0.9% increase in 2016, which was also the average increase for the preceding five years. In particular, the rate of increase in electricity demand (3.1%) is signifi- cantly higher than that for the other energy sources. Further, China, the USA, India, Russia, and Japan are the top electricity consumers in the world.
Furthermore, 70% of the world’s consumption is attributed to the top ten electricity consumers, with China, the USA, and India accounting for 28.98%, 17.97%, and 6.47%, respectively. Energy consumption has increased because of the increased industrialization and globalization caused by high population and economic growth. In 2016, China consumed 23% of the world’s total energy with an oil equivalent of 30.53 million (Liu and Lei, 2018). The difference in China’s electricity demand and energy consumption provides a reference for developing countries and in the context of efficient energy and electricity reforms.
Fig. 1 shows electricity generation by various major fuel sources. Global electricity reforms were proposed in the broader economic perspective, and addressing the industry’s challenges became more ur- gent in the 1980s (Hartley et al., 2019). These challenges ranged widely across countries. For instance, the electricity industry in the developed countries was inefficient, which caused an increase in electricity prices (Balakrishnan et al., 2007). In contrast, developing countries faced se- vere power shortages, low investments in terms of expansion of systems, and poor supply quality (Polemis, 2017). Therefore, the world has seen ongoing electricity reforms over the last three decades. The first wave of reforms began with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in the 1980s. Following this effort, Latin American and Asian countries have also adopted similar reforms based on their “standard model.” The OECD model is based on the following factors: commodification of public utilities; introduction of unbundling for competition; restructuring, privatization, and greater freedom for independent distributors and independent power producers (IPPs); creation of autonomous regulatory bodies; and standardization of pric- ing for wholesale electricity distribution for better competition (Der- tinger and Hirth, 2020). The standard model does not consider local influences on the reforms’ outcomes. However, the global market liberalization experience demonstrates the role of these influences on the reforms, which has been studied in the literature in case of the non-OECD countries (Yu, 2012).
The remaining sections are organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review, section 3 represents the demographic global electricity reforms, section 4 contains the concept of energy efficiency index approaches, and section 5 discusses the obtained results with a brief discussion. The final section provides our conclusions on the findings of this work with recommendations for policy.
2. Literature review
The significance of power reforms has been highlighted by several recent researchers. For example, Karekezi and Kimani (2002) deemed that reforms in the power sector are critical drivers of economic growth and can help improve the generation capacity and financial performance of some utilities. Ahmed and Bhatti (2019) indicated that the issue of the various conflicting regulatory reforms across different countries and regions of the world should be considered while formulating the power sector policy. Public factors play a significant role in policy change (Mohsin et al., 2019b, 2020a). This was debated at various levels; for example, Bertsch et al. (2016) attempted to investigate the power sector reform phenomenon from the dataset of an advanced country. Janet Ruiz-Mendoza and Sheinbaum-Pardo (2010) concluded that developing countries are active in the power sector and in economic and consumer utility reforms. Nagayama (2007) found that electricity production and reforms in Latin America, the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe influenced industrial and household price changes.
Further, earlier studies attempted to cover various aspects of change in the power sector. For example, Ghosh and Kathuria (2016) discussed the performance of Indian thermal power plants with institutional quality as regulatory governance. Mohsin et al. (2019a) attempted to analyze the impact of power-sector reforms on the economic cycle of African countries while Ajayi et al. (2017) did the same for OECD countries. In addition, studies have shown that power sector reform is strongly interdependent in other economic and environmental sectors (Nepal and Jamasb, 2012). For example, Wei et al. (2020) emphasized that electricity-related carbon emissions are the main contributor to global warming and account for more than 40% of carbon emissions, both globally and in China. Likewise, Liu et al. (2019) suggested that energy security has co-benefits related to climate policies. Thus, energy has multiple impacts, and energy efficiency is a significant issue.
Findings from previous research suggest that the increased capacity generation and the distribution and transmission losses in the respective regions are due to reform variables such as the entry of independent power producers, the unbundling of generation and transmission, the establishment of regulatory agencies, and the emergence of a wholesale spot market (Nagayama, 2010). These studies have attempted to address this relationship as a hypothesis, and tried to demonstrate the rela- tionship between the reform of the power sector and other initiatives. Raew studies have considered energy efficiency and electricity reforms as a nexus (Dertinger and Hirth, 2020), (Xin-gang and Shu-ran, 2020) and (Mohsin et al., 2020b).
Previous studies attempted to analyze energy efficiency or power sector reform based on time series or panel datasets using different econometric techniques. For instance Nepal and Jamasb (2012) used macroeconomic and power sector reform panel data focused on bio-scale dynamic fixed-effects analysis (LSDVC), while the difference-and-difference approach was used for the same purpose by
Du et al. (2009). Sen et al. (2016) used estimations from the generalized method of moments (GMM) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) to assess electricity reforms for 17 developing economies from Asia in the 1990–2013 period. A multi-regional optimization model was used by Cheng et al. (2015) to evaluate the long-term planning of China’s power sector and helped show that the overall cost of China’s power sector could be reduced. Ajayi et al. (2017) used a short-term cost function in which the capital stock is treated as a quasi-fixed input factor to analyze the cost-effectiveness of electricity generation output (Mohsin et al., 2018, 2019b).
Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and difference-in-differences (DID) approaches have been applied to evaluate the energy efficiency of electricity reforms. They have been used to the examine the efficient methods of production in developing countries to estimate the effects of their restructuring strategies and policies for the power sector. For broader perceptions, the current study used a dataset of 48 countries from five regions. It outlines four forms of feedback on energy efficiency strategies and suggests a related index of energy output through DEA methods. We adopt a multi-dimensional approach to obtain a broader picture of the energy efficiency of the considered countries and to make suggestions for more efficient energy policies. Further, the growth of clean power has been incorporated in the assessment. With the appli- cation of DID, this study attempts to find the real difference between energy efficiency without reforms and with reforms of the examined countries based on their respective regions. Finally, an electricity reform framework is proposed based on the results of this study.
3. Global electricity reforms
Over the last 30 years, there has been continuous development in energy reforms (Khanna and Zilberman, 2001; Fetz and Filippini, 2010). For instance, wholesale markets with innovative capabilities, such as the UK, exposed the incompatibility of renewable sources. This is because the “standard model”’ predates the age of the expansion of renewable energy, and is therefore incompatible with renewable technology (Fili- ppini and Wetzel, 2014). In fact, the introduction of new decarbonization-related priorities has illustrated the need for a system-level transition strategy (Foster and Rana, 2019). In this case, a network solution includes considering power, transportation, heating, and cooling, defining the utilities that dictate energy usage, and reforming the preparation and functioning of energy systems to generate less waste and pollution (Ramstetter et al., 2013). For example, over-generation by wind and solar power projects may be used for producing hydrogen during certain hours of the day. The hydrogen thus generated can be useful in decarbonizing the current fossil fuel de- mographics and in addressing the long-term seasonal variation in solar and wind sources for power generation (Ajayi et al., 2017).
These changes in electricity reforms have been affecting the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, where power markets have traditionally been structured through legislative or de facto control on production . From 2000, the policy in MENA countries contributed to a gradual move away from these models, but development was still lag- ging, and changes appeared to be focused on the standard model. Iran’s reform laws are based on wholesale markets (Nepal and Jamasb, 2012), and the UAE’s (Abu Dhabi) reform legislation (1998) allows for dis- aggregated single buyers with mutual exchange and third-party access. On the other hand, Qatar and Kuwait’s reform laws mostly apply to IPPs (Wogan et al., 2018). Further, the electricity markets follow the single-buyer model, depending on market competition. MENA econo- mies control much of the region’s capacity, pipelines, and networks. Hence, they decide the price ranges for different value chain sectors. This makes them the primary suppliers of power plant feedstocks (Foster and Rana, 2019).
However, MENA economies have failed to establish autonomous regulatory bodies and the existing energy structures are controlled by the oil and gas industry (Foster et al., 2019). Renewable sources in these markets also have to contend with an unfair playing area with certain carbon vectors. Besides the slow rate of restructuring, there are three factors that restrict achieving maximum returns from the restructuring of the electricity sector (Ruamsuke et al., 2015). First, tariffs on retail electricity have become massively subsidized and do not adequately represent the costs of output or capacity. According to Dyllick-- Brenzinger and Finger (2013), domestic energy prices ranged from less than 1 to 2 US cents/kWh across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The similar sitaution has been observed in GCC and OECD region as well. While the initiative seems to have made some gains, the changes were primarily made either to fuels for transportation or to electricity. However, the final costs remain below the production costs in the case of electricity, which is due to a significantly low base for adjustment (Sharifuddin, 2014). Many countries have seen increasing residential tariffs in the last two years, particularly Saudi Arabia. For example, the average electricity tariffs from Saudi electricity companies were at 4.82 US Cents/kWh in 2018. This price is significantly lower than the country’s actual electricity tariffs (Alarenan et al., 2020). However, tariffs in other countries have been low, particularly, 1 US Cent/kWh for Iran (as of March 2019). Due to these subsidy-based tar- iffs, receipts from utilities were inadequate, forcing these countries to constantly depend on regional expenditures for their expenditure and service requirements (Cramton and Stoft, 2008), (Rahman et al., 2016) and (Sahoo et al., 2016).
The Covid-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the global energy system, which is not only inhibiting investment, but also intimidating to slow the expansion of key clean energy technologies. The progress of clean energy technology was encouraging before the crisis, but it was uneven. The annual IEA report on ""Tracking Clean Energy Progress"" shows that only 6 technologies and fields are on the ""right track"" out of 46 to achieve the long-term sustainability goals for 2019. These include electric vehicles, rail transportation and lighting. Although the other 24 industries have made some progress, this is not enough to achieve long- term goals, and the remaining 16 industries have seriously ""off track"" (Steffen et al., 2020). Thus, reform in electricity is much required to enhance capability and efficiency of electricity to be sustaining. . Energy efficiency index methodology
DEA is one of the many techniques for efficiency evaluation while the approach has gained popularity because of its macro-level economic assessment of regional energy and its effects on the environment. There are several advantages to using the DEA method:
• Efficiency evaluation through certain outputs and inputs • Priori definition of the frontier form is not necessary
• Assessing the absoulte and relative efficiency of DMUs
• Generally no information is required on price
This study used the slack-based methodology Slack-based data envelopement analysis (SBM-DEA) adopted by Tyteca (1996) and Zhou et al. (2006a) to measure energy efficiency (Rao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2018). Let us consider an example of a manufacturing process in which both desirable and undesirable outputs are manufac- tured. Suppose X = (x1,x2,...,xn), Y= (y1,y2,...,ym), U = (u1,u2,...,uj) are the vectors of inputs and outputs, which are as follows: (i) Assumes that there are poorly disposable desirable and undesirable outputs, which means that the reduction in undesirable outputs is not free. Similarly, a relative reduction in undesirable and desirable outputs are possible (Emrouznejad and Yang, 2016). DEA can measure the relative efficiency score when multiple inputs and outputs are used to evaluate energy efficiency. Assumption (ii) shows that once the required outputs are manufactured, certain undesirable output would also be generated (F ̈are and Grosskopf, 2004). A (CRS) DEA environ- mental technologies can be used as, Energy consumption is a basic pillar of economic development. However, increased consumption of fossil fuel causes environmental pollution; consequently, it is essential to measure the efficiency and energy consumption (Zhou et al., 2006a). Whereas EE1evalutes the consumption of primary energy for the pro- posed countries (DMUs). The DEA method has advantages in dealing with multiple inputs and outputs, and does not need the presupposition of functional relation- ships in evaluation, which greatly reduces the risk of subjectivity in the study, overcomes the deviation caused by radial and angle in the traditional model. This study uses the method proposed by Stone and Cooper (2001) and further improved by Zhou et al. (2006b), which is the extension of the SBM model to measure an economic-environmental performance, Further literature review shows significant differences in the selec- tion of indicators of the unexpected output among different scholars in the research on the efficiency measurement through the DEA model. θ* shows the measurement of slacks-based economic performance and its effective value is close 1(Zhou et al., 2006). Model (5) outputs and inputs are strongly disposable compared with Model (1). Let (θx* , θe* , θb* , λ*j ,
sx− *, se− *, sy+*, sb− *) be the optimum obtained from Model (2). Then ilrf
energy efficiency index at this stage (power usage efficiency index) can be defined as: Here, θe*elj − sel− ∗represents the minimum energy input level asso- ciated with the best frontline usage power for a DMU. Energy efficiency index can be achieved by using the ratio of objective energy to actual energy consumption. In model 6 suppse that the policymakers capable to refine the inputs and outputs by achieved more efficient situation.To demonstrate the economic and pollution production, following two indices are used to measure enegry efficiency where the former repre- sents the energy efficiency index and the latter, the total factor power efficiency index. where w1 and w2 represent the homogeneous weights associated with the customers for the total input and output, respectively, it is difficult to reach consent (Zhou et al., 2008).Therefore, the current work discusses the advantages of non-parametric frontier methods from the perspective of energy efficiency. Let b be the bad outputs (generally CO2 can be taken as an undesirable output) and Tw = {(x,g,b):x can produce (g,b)}; then, according to the weak disposability orientation approach, (x, g, b) ∈ Tw and θ ∈ [0, 1] imply (θg, θb)∈Tw. Furthermore, (x, g, b) ∈ Tw and b = 0 imply g = 0. This condition is called the null-jointness (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2012a, 2012b). Usually, policy-makers and managers tend to weight input/output in order to address the significany of efficiency measures so for the case of δ* > 0 (inept DMU), enhanced efficiency can be achieved by reduction in the two input excesses (i.e., energy/non-energy), by meeting the shortages in outputs and by reduction in the excesses of undesirable output. Hence, energy efficiency index can be defined as. A well-organized DMU provides the return-to-scale type through Model (10), which can be achieved through Model (11) in the case of an ineffective DMU. For this reason, current work discusses the advantages of non-parametric methods from a comprehensive energy efficiency perspective. Similarly, an EEI (energy efficacy index) under an aligned efficiency index and EEI (under executive disposability) can be defined as. All constraints in Model (15) show that the optimization of Model 15 provides the lower and upper limits for σ and τ, and hence, while the vector of slacks can be used to reduce the inputs and increases the probable output therefore the corresponding reduction in the scale of each DMU by using specific inputs and outputs. Energy efficiency scores (Sueyoshi and Wang, 2017) indicate that undesirable outputs achieve lower comparative weights than the unit increases of the inputs. If the overall capability score of the DMU is equal to 1, Model-16 requires the functional organization to maintain a balance. The following transformation can help to measute the energy efficiency, 1p,...,Here, ai is the weight related to input xi, and ρf represents the weight associated with the undesirable output bf . In order to establish an energy efficiency index, in other words, combine the limitations of Model-17 with the reasons behind the purpose. Next, the combined multidirectional energy efficiency index is defined based on the above efficiencies specific to variables: 
5. Results and discussion
5.1. Electricity reforms and energy efficiency
At present, fossil fuels remain the main source of energy despite their high emission rates and the associated environmental concerns. In this context, policymakers and governments are discouraging further implementation of such sources and encouraging clean renewable en- ergy resources.
Table 1 presents the scores for energy efficiency for 48 countries based on the DEA model. Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore, and Albania are the most efficient countries in the considered period (2010–14), fol- lowed by Kyrgyz Republic, Turkey, Tajikistan, Slovenia, and Lithuania. The results indicate that Uzbekistan has the lowest efficiency score, while Hungary and Bulgaria are the second and third least efficient countries, respectively. It is also evident that 12 out of 48 countries have efficiency scores of approximately 0.5, (Table 1). This is particularly worrying, considering the electricity shortage and the importance of production for economic growth. However, most of these countries have been pushing for better efficiency ratings, and hence are subject to radical privatization and restructuring. Furthermore, poor countries have been implementing energy reforms to reduce poverty and the negative effects of these factors. The key beneficiaries of these change- s—inward-looking industrialists and workers—at least tended to sup- port such improvements, as the financial crisis and hyper-inflation seemed to have compelled them to recognize some of the costs associ- ated with changes that were supposed to save them from economic disasters.
However, energy policies have failed to attract help from powerful local industry representatives who typically occupy key policy roles. As a consequence, these countries have maintained many of the core ele- ments of energy reform, but are expected to improve the environment through more concerted policy interventions (Singh and Jha, 2017). Energy changes are a significant feature of the welfare state in terms of adequate energy availability, and the governments viewed power scar- city as a possible obstacle to the development of a welfare state. Therefore, power companies in these countries were urged to develop “better forecasts” of the potential demand for energy and to quickly build electrical infrastructure to satisfy demand.
Table 2 shows the correlation among inputs and outputs. Energy savings have not been granted much attention by the power industry, though power reforms are in urgent need of adoption. The extensive energy use in the region’s industries is due to the following principal factors:
(i) High dependency of power companies on transmission networks.
(ii) Differences in investment costs for developed and developing
countries.
(iii) Necessity of long-term growth of the private manufacturing
industry.
Energy quality demonstrates a strong relation to power reforms. Most specifically, operating with the commission tends to have important advantages in terms of the impacts of the single market induced by sector coupling.
5.2. Electricity reforms in terms of energy conservation opportunities
The objective of electricity-related reforms is to increase domestic energy conservation patterns. The variables for examining electricity reforms include a decrease in the use of energy for each unit of GDP. Energy conservation regulations have the potential to decrease energy use by up to 20%. Energy conservation via improved energy efficiency, combined with more electricity reforms, is a significant step for accel- erating sustainable development. With reference to access regressions, the outcomes are effective against holding back for sections of the population, which decreases the reform coefficient on connection rates by 0.6%. This is also true in the case of electricity use, although the result remains unaltered. In consumption regressions, when electricity connection prices are held back, the coefficient is no longer significant. In contrast, a positive and extremely significant coefficient obtains in the case of connection rate. While this reduces the duration of observation by five years, the predictions remain qualitatively unaltered, although they increase in size. The chances of saving energy depend on the following terms:
(i) Fuel trade is based on an applicable fuel for optimized energy transformation
(ii) It recognizes efficiency connections in energy-saving equipment, such as thermal fluid heating, congregation, further developing current efficiencies, and captive power generation
(iii) It identifies areas that have significant opportunities for enhancement, which have hitherto been unexplored.
(iv) It entails recognizing the opportunity networks for improving efficiency, such as power factor enhancement in electricity sys- tems (Fig. 1). In addition, although the quantity of electricity produced in the 2004–2016 period hardly changed, the per- centage of electricity produced using renewable sources nearly doubled in this period, from 14.3% to 26.9%. This hike is largely because of a rise in renewables such as wind, solar, and biofuels; overall production has declined by about 1%. The increased proportion of renewables and heightened consumption of more efficient gas-fired power production, alongside decreased con- sumption of coal for producing electricity has led to an increase in the average efficiency of the power plant from 36% in 1990 to 44% in 2014. Emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxides by the power sector have dramatically increased between 1990 to 2003. In 2014 and 2015, sulfur dioxide emissions declined by 77%, par- ticulates, by 81%, and nitrous oxides, by 49%.
5.3. Technical and economic feasibility for maximizing system efficiency Transformations in the power and electric industry of developing countries and the results related to electricity and efficiency access indicate the loss-minimization impact of governing bodies when they work together with IPPs. In contrast, using the same data and an aggregate reform index, Sueyoshi and Wang (2017) discovered that reforms enhance losses. However, by investigating the residential elec- tricity connection rates, we find that it affects privatization and regu- lation positively, but has a negative impact for partial unbundling on connection rates.
Hence, reforms of electricity and their technical feasibility need to consider the following aspects:
(i) Availability of technology, dependability, proficient labor, space, etc.
(ii) Effect of energy efficiency on quality and security
(iii) The ability to meet maintenance needs and overheads.
When energy consumption and quantity are well balanced, the next step is to ensure equipment efficiency in operating and maintaining the best technology. This may include: Overcoming steam leakages by detecting them more effectively. Improvements in distillation
(iii) Embracing combustion controls to efficiency. Table 3 shows weighted data. A 1% rise in the proportion of the population with access to power is associated with a 1.3% rise in the use of power. This means that increased official access rates can result in increased consumption of power. This is a critical requirement to audit technical and commercial (AT&C) losses. The Integrated Energy Policy emphasizes that the current Accelerated Power Development and Re- form Programme (APDRP) ought to offer a performance stimulus to the workforce to reduce the AT&C losses. Incentive programs need to be formulated that cater to the unique needs of each sector. Thus, we deduce that reform activity, when considered as a mixture, does not solve all the problems pertaining to the electric and power industry, and that different kinds of problems require separate kinds of policies. Policies related to electricity reforms, such as the assessment of price of energy sources, ought to consider the social costs and the cost of insuf- ficiency. It is important to omit all subsidy aspects from the pricing model.
5.4. Improving energy efficiency and the electricity reform process
In the absence of energy efficiency, reform procedures would not produce the best results. The essential energy demand in the Middle East has risen at a rate of 4.4% annually from 2000, which double the global average (IEA, 2018). These outcomes indicate that any advantages gained from reforming process, when implemented individually, will most probably be offset by deeply rooted trends of careless energy use. 
In addition, there needs to be an optimal combination of the two com- ponents of the energy system, that is, price rationalization and efficiency improvement. Furthermore, in addition to the clear environmental benefits (energy savings) of reforms, it can also create harmony with price rationalization which can decrease the payback period and can assist in increasing optimized economic the relationship between the cost of energy they use and energy efficiency (IEA, 2018). While efforts are underway throughout the region to enhance the possible advantages should be considered more clearly as integral to policies related to electricity sector reforms.
The results show strong indications for reforms being beneficial to energy efficiency and electricity access. A set of reform programs con- taining eight separate reform steps increases energy efficiency by 13%, and per capita electricity access by 62%. For energy efficiency, the re- sults suggest that the preferred requirement actually initiates higher T&D losses, whereas electricity reforms aimed to decrease non-technical losses in particular. This is predominantly relevant to T&D losses, whose causes may be too deeply rooted in social problems given their mainly non-technical nature, while the quality of regulatory governance can be solved only within the electric power sector.
The DID showed good model fit for the analysis because there were no significant differences between the control group and the treated group before the event, while the DID shows a 13.2% improvement in energy efficiency after the event (electricity reforms). It must be noted that the period before the event occurred before the electricty reforms (1983), while the period after the event is the period after the electricty reforms of 2013. Tables 4 and 5 show the energy efficiency and elec- tricity reforms before and after the reform period.
Fig. 2 shows energy efficiency. It is crucial to plan electricity reforms with due consideration to the essential financial resources and to enhancing human capabilities. The aims of technological and electricity reforms include enhancing the presentation and promotion of current technologies to enhance efficiency; the business aspects and resilience of electricity use; and advancing and implementing novel technologies with a view to enhancing their possible advantages to the environment. The governments should adopt a policy of electricity reforms to handle the gradual decrease in energy subsidies.
5.5. Scenario-based electricity reform
In case a sustainable method of energy conservation with efficient electricity reforms cannot be set up, any attempts to achieve energy efficiency would be baseless. Hence, the countries considered in this study should further examine practical methods to conserve energy and implement electricity reforms, should set up sustainable processes for both, and should consider this policy a driving force to enhance long- term advancement. The developing economies that are struggling to enforce efficiency policies for energy should focus on the performance of these policies, based on the standards of developed. They should seri- ously examine new electricity efficiency and energy conservation mea- sures. To improve the capability of sustainable development of all countries, it is important to advance energy efficiency and conservation through electricity reform policies globally.
Energy efficiency from electricity reforms requires various steps in certain scenarios. In the following, we identify such scenarios and elaborate on the potential reforms for each. In Scenario (A), as shown in Figure (3), the private sector generates all electricity from renewable sources. In this scenario, the per-unit cost of production needs to be decreased and end-use consumers (industry and household) must be activated for increased and efficient consump- tion of electricity from this source.
For the type of scenario shown in Figure (4), the following can be considered:
● Countries should enhance financial stimulus more and have a target- based effectiveness assessment structure while vigorously boosting energy conservation and efficiency in the private industry
● It is pertinent to encourage modernization in renewable energy sources along with improved electricity generation
● Current structures of energy and electricity distribution and scaling should be modernized
● Business and domestic use appliances must be converted to electricity-based energy
● These countries must restrict their ambitions for growth and/or depend on green renewable energy to a greater extent as a sustain- able policy, specifically for the private sector.
● They must introduce an energy efficiency policy, greater capital in- vestment, boost policy implementation, and set up a market-centric sustainable procedure for conserving energy and electricity effec- tiveness in the private sector.
Maximizing social wellbeing with regional electricity reforms under demand on top of marginal cost is modeled through: where, H = high-voltage customer consumption, L = low-voltage customer consumption. Scenario (B)
In this scenario, electricity is generated through public/private partnerships, established on the idea of decentralizing renewable re- sources. A holistic perspective of public–private partnership relative to policy choices can guarantee the desired result in terms of energy effi- ciency and electricity consumption. Policy makers ought to engage energy/electricity production as well as distribution and consumption with public–private partnerships as policy tools to accomplish sustainable economic development in the long run (Fig. 5).
Government generation should be deterred for electricity produc- tion, distribution, and commercialization, specifically for these types of developed countries.
Increasing global trade, partnership, and collaboration to nurture production of modern efficient energy
Providing longer-term financing in energy/electricity systems established on public-private partnerships to enhance delivery effi- ciency. It is important to examine and move towards energy- producing programs for green power development systems that are also favorable for investment. It is imperative to give utmost pref- erence to green sources of energy/electricity generation, such as solar, gas, wind, and water.
● Collective attempts to increase public consciousness, education, and coaching of workforce and service buyers in electricity production plants and better stimulus to players for judicious and efficient uti- lization of electricity will also result in positive results. In addition, technological improvement through R&D is essential to enhance generation and distribution structures and for optimal utilization of electricity.
● The government should play the role of organizers in this practice for both the customer and the producer.
The government should aid the private sector in discovering and setting up projects, which are otherwise more risky or less viable for individual private producers. This would assist in improving electricity generation based on renewable sources. In this regard, the aim should be to decrease the per-unit cost of generation and encourage the end user (industrial sector and domestic users) to utilize this source of electricity more optimally.
Social wellbeing should be maximized through electricity reforms and the electricity efficiency pricing region under demand above marginal cost. This scenario needed the producer and final user to control the electricity production and consumption produced from nonrenewable resources (Zhang and Fan, 2019).
● The units of generation and use should be altered to renewable source-based electricity
● The arrangement of efficient electricity consumption should be embraced as a standard for all industries and should consider the overall developed degree of energy efficiency and the capacity to correct energy systems.
● Electricity regulations to regulate the magnitude of energy should be considered as each economy develops (Fig. 6)
● Increased reliance on the use of fossil fuel energy results in bigger issues of energy efficiency and energy magnitude. In addition to reducing energy magnitude, developing economies should contribute as directors in introducing more efficient energy-saving methods and green energy technologies such as natural gas, hydro- power, nuclear power, and renewable energy. This would, in turn, decrease energy consumption, improve energy efficiency, and enhance green energy consumption from efficient electricity, thereby positively affecting economic development.
Scenario (D)
In this scenario, the public sector generation and consumption of electricity from non-renewable sources is essentially curbed.
● The market cannot manage collective operation of the electricity system by itself and hence,
● the required regulatory framework needs to be implemented (Fig. 7),
● developing countries must gain insights from developed economies through a deep analysis of their energy conservation and electricity efficiency measures and then create an improved plan of action for energy conservation and enhance electricity structure according to
their own requirements for growth. Power customers produce their own electricity from sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and gas and then provide to the grid. This is paramount for a sustainable energy future. However, it raises ques- tions on the process of securing future energy structures in light of climate change.
● From the perspective of policies aimed at enhancing economic ac- tion, reform-related policies play a very significant role by restricting coal use and boosting clean use of fossil fuels and the advancement of non-fossil fuels, including solar, wind, nuclear, and hydro.
● A decrease in energy magnitude significantly enhances economic growth. Regulation of energy structure and electricity reforms lead to an increase in petroleum processing and demand for construction and coking.
● The collective outcomes of energy magnitude and alterations in the system decrease industry assistance for improving economic cir- cumstances. Considering these facts, a standardizing structure is advisable for the initial distribution of renewable resources for improved efficiency in every generation. 6. Conclusion and policy implication
This study applied the DEA method to measure energy efficiency through electricity reforms using a dataset of 48 countries in five different regions for the 2010–2014 period. Labor and energy con- sumption were used as input, with GDP (desired) and CO2 per capita (undesired) as outputs. Furthermore, the difference-in-differences (DID) method was applied on the dataset to divide countries in their respective regions (five regions in total). This study arrived at the following results based on the above-mentioned analysis.
◆ According to the DEA outcomes, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore, and Albania have the highest position in energy efficiency among the developing countries based on their respective datasets. Based on the five-year observation data, these countries scored 1 on average and ranked first in the lineup. Nineteen countries or 39% of the total dataset had an efficiency score frequency from 0.8 to 0.99, which are considered the second-best countries in this analysis. Nearly the same number of countries (18) struggle to achieve a higher efficiency rank in terms of energy users, as their energy efficiency score frequency ranges from 0.51 to 0.79. Ac- cording to the results of the DEA model, 11 countries are per- forming very poorly as they are able to score less than 0.5 in energy efficiency during the said time span. Uzbekistan is the lowest performer in this dataset, followed by Hungary and Bulgaria.
◆ According to the output of the DID analysis, in the pre-reform period, Sub-Saharan Africa was the lowest performer in all re- gions, followed by Eastern Europe, Central, and the Middle East & North Europe. After the introduction of electricity reforms, the conditions changed dramatically, as Sub-Saharan Africa attained the highest position in this regional lineup, followed by East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia. Here, although the conditions of efficiency have also improved in the Middle East, North, and Eastern Europe and Central Europe, the reform impact is lower than in Sub-Saharan Africa. This conclusion of DID could have important implications for the relationship between energy effi- ciency and reform, as there are other important factors that have a strong influence on the policy design and execution of elec- tricity reforms.
Based on the above-mentioned outcomes, this study suggests following policy guidelines.
Policy agents have a straightforward impact on the cost of energy products, resulting in additional pressure on the underprivileged. Hence, at the end-user level, fairness towards underprivileged families and communities needs to be considered while developing policies and gauging their effects, given that these are extremely important factors that are often disregarded and omitted. At the government level, the condition of the local economy along with the physical location should be recognized during policy development.
The government, consumers, and service production are recognized
as essential elements in the energy saving structure and electricity re- forms. It is important to harmonize the supply/demand market between service production and end users. To enhance the development of renewable energy technologies, the government can offer funding and discounts. Conversely, in energy utilization, governments play an inte- gral role by supporting consumers in adapting their lifestyle and be- haviors and in reducing energy demand, through policy direction. Consumers, as the major energy users, are pivotal to the energy con- sumption system, where several variables (e.g., lifestyle, income level, and environment consciousness) impact their actions. Service genera- tors who supply the energy markets and provide technological assis- tance, are essential for policy implementation and energy demand. Despite this, energy transport systems have been most commonly overlooked by policies and regulations. This study has certain limitations and makes suggestions for future work based on these. Data availability is a major concern for the generalizability of study’s results. Although a sufficient number of countries are considered in this study, the number of indicators and their datasets are limited. For example, according to the reform, Sub-Saharan Africa performs better than the rest of other regions, and it could be the proper policy extension. Thus, the enhancement of the relevant indica- tor list can be helpful in generating a big picture of the relationship between energy efficiency and electricity reforms.

26,Opportunities and barriers to demand response in China,"China is quickly installing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), which could provide tremendous opportunities in developing and utilizing demand response resources. Demand response may potentially create a profitable industry and contribute to efficiency improvement, cost reduction, and pollution mitigation of the entire electricity sector. However, China lags behind the developed world in utilizing demand response. Institutional barriers, including the lack of competitive electricity market and the resistance by the state grid corporations, are preventing the commercialization of demand response. In order to fully realize the potential of smart grid, China needs to push forward the reforms toward establishing an open access electricity market so the pollution-free demand response resources may compete with power generators on leveled field.","1. Introduction:demandresponseanditsbenefits
The operation of an electric power grid is a constant balancing act. Most of the power generators, such as coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants, are most efficient when they are oper- ating at stable output. The consumption of electricity, however, fluctuates constantly. Because the storage of electricity is difficult and expensive, grid operators have to constantly ‘dispatch’, which is to bring power generators online or off-line, to meet the fluctuating demand.
Traditional electricity tariffs are based on the average cost of electricity, so consumers have no incentive to adjust their demands according to the real-time cost of power generation. Conventional analog electricity meters can only record the total amount of usage without information on the time of use, and without real-time com- munication with the grid operator. Therefore, in the past, a grid operator had control only on power generators, but not on power consumers, so the dispatches were entirely on the supply side. The adoption of time-of-use (TOU) pricing motivates end-users to adjust demand in response to the variable price of electricity over time, and the introduction of smart meters enables the grid operator to remotely dispatch the interruptible demand loads.
The installation of smart grid makes it possible and easier to manage or dispatch the demand. Peak-load generators are typically small, inefficient, expensive and more polluting than base-load ones. By utilizing demand-side resources to replace the use of peaking generators, a grid operator may reduce both the overall cost and pollution of the electric power system.
Demand response (DR) is to adjust the demand of electricity by end-users in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, in order to reduce electricity use at times of high prices and to relieve the congestion of the power grid. The implementation of DR could be categorized into two types: non-dispatchable and dis- patchable (Balijepalli et al., 2011). Non-dispatchable DR refers to the electricity end-users’ changes in consumption in response to a TOU retail electricity pricing scheme. Dispatchable DR is the direct remote control of end-users’ interruptible electrical appliances, which the grid operator can dispatch to temporarily reduce demand and possibly shift the demand to a later time when the cost of gener- ation is lower. In addition to lowering the cost of peaking electricity, dispatchable DR also helps to maintain the reliability of the power grid. Therefore, dispatchable DR is equivalent to a virtual peaking power plant, which consumes no energy and emits no pollution.
The practice of DR can improve the efficiency of resource uti- lization and reduce pollution by closer alignment of consumer’s electricity tariffs to the true costs of power generation (USDOE, 2006). The consumers who participate in DR programs may reduce their electricity bills by optimizing their time of use and earn incentive payments by selling their dispatchable demand loads to DR aggregators. By avoiding or reducing the use of costly peak- ing electricity, the system-wide costs of electricity is reduced. The standby DR resources can also be dispatched in emergency to avoid power outages, which often incur high economic costs, dam- ages and inconvenience to consumers. Overall, DR resources are low-cost, pollution-free and could generate incomes to consumers and external benefits to the society as a whole.
According to an estimate by GTM Research, with its rapid installation of advanced metering infrastructure, China could have potential DR resources of over 30 GW by 2016 (Bojanczyk and Leeds, 2012). Unfortunately, the lack of progress in electricity mar- ket reforms has prevented the commercialization of DR in China.
2. DemandresponseinChina
In the 1990s, the former State Power Corporation implemented a few demand side management (DSM) programs, including direct load control, load adjustment, peaking load pricing, and TOU pricing (Yu, 2012; Zeng et al., 2013). In April 2002, the State Council autho- rized the “Scheme of the Reform for Power Industry” and broke up the vertically integrated State Power Corporation into five genera- tion groups and two grid corporations (Xu and Chen, 2006). The separation of generation and transmission was supposedly only the first step in the 2002 reform agenda, which aimed to estab- lish an electricity market eventually. However, the reform hardly moved forward after 2002. The electricity market was not estab- lished. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) have continued to set the wholesale and retail electricity prices administratively.
After the 2002 reform, the two state grid companies assumed the responsibilities for DSM. The focuses of the grid companies’ DSM programs are on energy efficiency and peak-shaving. The government has promulgated several DSM plans and measures, which primarily focus on administrative and technical measures. However, there has been little progress in market-based DR devel- opment.
The NDRC announced the “Electricity Demand-side Manage- ment Measures” in 2010, which required the grid corporations to implement load monitoring and load control through electric load management system. The load monitoring capability is required to reach 70% of regional maximum load, and the load control capa- bility to reach 10%. All users of 100-kilo-Volt-Amps and above are included in the scope of load management system. The load man- agement systems should have provided the grid companies with the technical infrastructure for the implementation of DR.
Article 11 of the “Electricity Demand-side Management Meas- ures” charged the governmental pricing departments with the tasks of promoting TOU tariffs, encouraging off-peak energy storage, and implementing seasonal tariffs in selected regions and differ- ent prices for high-reliability and interruptible demands. By 2015, the TOU tariffs have been adopted in 16 provinces and cover about 65% of industrial and commercial electricity users (Stern, 2015). In China, the TOU tariffs are administratively determined and often not based on the cost of electricity supply. Typically, the peak price is set at about 1.5 times of the average price, while the off-peak price is set at about half of the average price. To the author’s knowledge, there is very little publicly available information on the effects of these TOU pricing schemes.
In 2012, the NDRC and the Ministry of Finance jointly created a fund for DSM pilot projects (Table 1). With the support of this fund, four cities: Suzhou, Beijing, Foshan, and Tangshan conducted DSM pilot programs, including interruptible tariffs, real-time pricing, peak-load pricing, and cooling storage pricing. No dispatchable DR was included in these pilot programs.
In 2013, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) and Honeywell conducted China’s first automated demand response program (Honeywell, 2013). The scope of this program is rather limited, including only two commercial buildings and two industrial buildings. The program demonstrated the peak-shaving capacity of 15–30%. In the summer of 2014, Shanghai conducted a DR pilot program consisted of 33 commercial and public buildings and 31 industrial enterprises, with over 100 MW aggregated load capacity. However, due to the lack of electricity market, the aggregated DR cannot be traded in a market setting. The central government, Shanghai city government, and the Energy Foundation funded the financial scheme for utilizing DR in the Shanghai pilot project (Stern, 2015). The objectives of the DR pilot were to demonstrate the capability of the technology and coordinate with existing electricity load man- agement system, and to explore the potentials of a trading scheme among large electricity end-users (SGCC, 2014). Due to the lack of wholesale electricity market, demand response is not allowed to compete with peaking power generators.
In 2014, the NDRC issued a notice on the electricity pricing pol- icy for electric vehicle charging facilities, where the TOU pricing is mandated. It is still too early to tell how the TOU pricing may influ- ence the charging behaviors electric vehicles and whether electric vehicles will become significant demand response resources.
In March 2015, China initiated a second round of electricity reform with limited scope. The Central Committee of the Commu- nist Party and the State Council officially announced the reform agenda as the document on “Deepening Reform of the Power Sec- tor” (Dupuy and Weston, 2015). The main objectives of this reform are to open up retail electricity markets and implement revenue- capped transmission tariff regulations. The prospect of competitive wholesale electricity market has remained uncertain.
3. Strengths due to state-owned monopolies
The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and China South- ern Power Grid Company (CSG) operate two of the world’s largest power grids. The state-owned monopolistic status provides China’s grid companies with many advantages in financing and building smart grids, as well as in standardization of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI).
3.1. Rapid installations of AMI
China is leading the world in smart grid investment, with more installed smart meters than the rest of the world combined (Gonzalez, 2014). By the end of 2013, China has installed over 250 million smart meters, which covered about 70% of households. The State Grid Corporation of China expects to achieve 100% smart meter coverage in 2017.
Smart grid technology is a capital-intensive investment. The technology is expensive to install, but relatively inexpensive to operate. Once a capital-intensive AMI is in place, it would be eco- nomically beneficial to keep it in use for as long as possible (at least for decades). The financing of such tremendous upfront cap- ital investment could be challenging in many countries, but not in China, because China’s state-owned grid companies are financial giants. For comparison, the revenue of SGCC was US$333.4 billion in 2014, while the revenue of PG&E, the largest utility company in the United States, was merely US$17.1 billion in the same year. The sheer sizes and financial capabilities of China’s grid companies make it possible to install smart grid very quickly.
3.2. Economy of scale thanks to wide area interconnection
The economy of scale through wide area interconnection offers great potential advantages in aggregating disperse demand response resources (Yang, 2009). The SGCC and CSG are among the largest grid operators in the world. For comparison, in terms of annual electricity delivery, total length of transmission lines, service area and population, CSG is roughly comparable to PJM, which is the largest transmission operator in the United States, while SGCC is roughly four times the size of PJM. Potential DR
Aggregators can benefit from economy of scale because they can accumulate more DR resources within the interconnection.
3.3. Easeofstandardizationandinteroperability
The monopolistic status of state-owned grid companies signifi- cantly eases the complexity in standardization. In setting national smart grid standards, the state-owned grid companies are virtually unchallenged. The standardizations within SGCC and CSG ensure the interoperability of AMI within their grids, which are among the largest in the world.
4. Opportunitiesforvariousstakeholders
The development of demand response resources could provide opportunities for many stakeholders in China, including the gov- ernment, renewable energy developers, power generators, and electricity consumers.
4.1. Assistinglow-carbondevelopmentforthegovernment
For the government, demand response offers an opportunity for low-carbon development. Due to the scarcity of gas-fired power, China’s electric power system often has to rely on small coal-fired generators and diesel generators to provide peaking electricity. The utilization of demand response resources could reduce the use of these high-carbon peaking generators.
4.2. Increasingdeploymentofwindpower,andphotovoltaic generation
In recent years, with very rapid growth in wind power capaci- ties, China is increasingly having difficulties in incorporating wind power in the grid. In 2014, the curtailment of wind power reached 18.6% (Wong and Zhu, 2015). Photovoltaic power generation has also been growing rapidly in China. The adoption of photovoltaic power in China has so far highly focused on utility-scale installa- tions. However, the government has started to promote distributed photovoltaic systems in the cities, where the variable photo- voltaic electricity outputs will be close to demand centers. Demand response could be dispatched to balance the power grid with variable renewable energy output and mitigate the curtailment (Stadler, 2008).
4.3. Potentialutilizationofelectricvehiclebatteriesasdemand response resources
The increasing adoption of electric vehicles may provide oppor- tunities for DR. As previously mentioned, China has mandated TOU pricing in electric car charging facilities. If electric cars become more popular in the future, they may play an important role in balancing the grids. Furthermore, China already has the world’s largest fleet of electric bicycles and scooters (Yang, 2010). With proper business models and incentive schemes, the tens of millions of batteries in electric bicycles and scooters may also be utilized as tremendous demand response resources. In the past, power generators in China can only sell their out- put to the grid companies. However, the 2015 reform agenda has indicated intention to introduce competition in the retail market, as well as allowing more direct power purchase for large power users (Zeng et al., 2015). When power generators sell through direct power purchase agreement, they may not have access to the grid operator’s balancing resources (such as pumped hydroelectric storage capacities and other peaking capacities on the grid). If a direct power purchase agreement includes an arrangement to uti- lize demand response resources, it could potentially lower the costs for both power generators and consumers.
4.5. Reduceelectricitybillsorprovideadditionalincomesto consumers
For the electricity consumers, demand response offers an opportunity for reducing their costs of electricity. If dispatchable demand response becomes commercialized, consumers may even earn additional incomes from offering their interruptible loads to demand response aggregators.
The technical features of China’s power grids offer many strengths in facilitating DR, and DR indeed has much to offer in effi- ciency gain, pollution reduction and potential income for various stakeholders in China. However, despite their great promises, DR resources are rarely utilized in China (Gao et al., 2014). The devel- opment of DR has largely been blocked by institutional barriers.
5. Institutional barriers
Despite the great potentials of DR and China’s unique strengths in physical infrastructure, China’s business environment is unfa- vorable to the development of DR. The commercialization of DR in China is blocked by the following institutional barriers:
5.1. LackofincentivetoimplementDRbygridoperators
From the self-interest perspective of grid companies, DR offers no profit. In fact, the utilization of DR mostly likely will reduce the incomes of grid companies by lowering their total delivery of elec- tricity. The grid companies have identified the lack of cost-recovery mechanisms and revenue losses due to DSM as key barriers to implement demand-side measures (Wang et al., 2010). Prior to the ongoing 2015 reform, the grid companies’ profits come from the differences between retail electricity tariffs and wholesale prices. The 2015 reform is aiming to set revenue-capped transmission tar- iffs based on the costs of transmission and an allowed rate of return. The profits of the grid companies will remain directly dependent on the total delivery of electricity. If the grid companies wish to maximize their profits, they are likely to avoid the utilization of DR.
Because the grid companies are both owners and operators of the transmission networks, they enjoy the exclusive access to the AMI. It is unlikely that China’s grid companies will willingly share data and provide open access to their smart grid to private DR aggregators. According to interviews by Azure Research (Stern, 2015), potential non-Chinese DR developers regard China’s grid companies as a main barrier to implement DR in China.
5.2. Incompleteelectricityreform
The U.S. DR business model, in which the DR aggregators sell their DR capacities in the wholesale electricity markets, is not appli- cable in China, because there is no wholesale electricity market. In China, the grid companies contract with power generators and dispatch power administratively. Due to the lack of cost-recovery mechanism, grid companies have no incentive to contract with DR aggregators in their dispatch operation.
The electricity reform in 2002 was suspended soon after the grids were separated from power generation. The originally envi- sioned reform to establish wholesale electricity market was not implemented. Due to the lack of transparency in China’s policy- making, it is difficult to determine when or whether the reform toward wholesale electricity market will move forward.
Several reports suggested that the state grid companies have been playing an active role in blocking reforms. A Chinese magazine reported that the SGCC is politically influential and in several cases openly defies the reform agenda to guard or extend its monopo- listic interests (Wang, 2010). The magazine was later punished for leaking internal reference information, which was not intended for the public (Zhai, 2010). Prof. Jiang Wu also pointed out that the 2015 reform agenda was compromised in many places in favor of the grid companies’ monopolistic interests (Wu, 2015).
5.3. Lowpriorityinpolicyagenda
The implementation of DR has not been a priority in China’s energy and environmental policy. Other than the few pilot pro- grams, there is no plan to promote DR on a broader scale. The grid companies lack the incentive to pursue DR, while they monopolize controls over AMI and are unwilling to share the data or access to smart grid. Without a forceful government policy, broader utiliza- tion of DR appears unlikely in China.
6. Policysolutionsandprospect
China is in a unique and bizarre position regarding DR. On the one hand, it is equipped with the world’s largest wide area intercon- nection and highest coverage of AMI, which provide the greatest DR potentials than anywhere else in the world. On the other hand, the monopolistic grid companies lack incentive to utilize DR by them- selves, and are unwilling to allow private DR aggregators to develop DR business with their smart grid. Without proactive government actions, the abundant DR resources and widely equipped AMI in China will remain underutilized or wasted.
Removing the institutional barriers to DR will be very challeng- ing. First of all, there is low awareness of DR and its potential benefits (Shen et al., 2012), because there have been only very limited experiences of DR implementation in China. Without fur- ther government promotion, DR is unlikely to develop in China. Meanwhile, political actions are unlikely to take place without awareness.
For those who wish to promote or develop DR in China, the prac- tical first step is to conduct information campaign and more pilot projects. Although there has already been several DR pilot projects in the past, these projects have remained relatively low profile and the development of DR is still a low priority in China’s energy policy. More informational and promotional efforts are still neces- sary. Potential stakeholders in the DR promotion campaigns may include government agencies, environmental groups, prospective DR aggregators, and equipment and solution providers. Once the pilot programs demonstrated the feasibility and bene- fits of DR, policymakers may be willing to prioritize DR in the policy agenda for power sector reform. Currently, the prospect of estab- lishing a wholesale electricity market in China in the near term seems slim. Nonetheless, the 2015 reform on retail competition and direct power purchase for large users may create a niche mar- ket for demand response. Such direct power purchases may provide opportunities for DR aggregators to bypass the inactive grid compa- nies, and develop a contractual scheme to include DR in the direct power purchase agreements. Although the scope of coverage in the direct power purchases may be limited, they could still provide useful experiences and publicity to assist further development of DR. Furthermore, the gradual expansion of direct power purchases over time may evolve into a de facto wholesale electricity mar- ket. Prospective DR aggregators should try to participate in the direct power purchases and facilitate the rule-making for future DR development.
An alternative route for DR in China is for the government to mandate grid companies to utilize DR resources. The policy could be imposed as a DR portfolio standard similar to the renewable elec- tricity portfolios widely adopted in many countries. The Chinese grid companies are already equipped with the technical capabil- ity for DR. A political mandate may obligate grid operators to implement DR so the nation can benefit from the low-cost and pollution-free virtual power plants.
Eventually, establishing wholesale electricity market should be the ultimate solution. The U.S. experiences in commercializing DR in the electricity markets may provide useful lessons for China (FERC, 2014). The United States Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated the Department of Energy to identify and quantify the benefits of demand response, and to recommend strategies to achieve such benefits with a clear timetable. The U.S. Federal Energy Regula- tory Commission then issued Order 745 which established the compensation scheme for demand response in wholesale elec- tricity market, and created the demand response industry. Just like in China, the DR development in the United States also faces resistances by embedded interests. The key lesson from the U.S. experience is that the government must proactively create rules for the DR market so the private DR industry may prosper and pro- duce public good. The U.S. and European experiences of promoting dynamic pricing have also both showed that regulatory agencies must play critical roles (Hu et al., 2015). If China wishes to enjoy the benefits of DR, the government must assume a more proactive role in reforming electricity market and designing rules for DR.

27,Performance of alternative electricity prices on residential welfare in China,"China is undergoing an energy-market reform while the residential sector remains the most prudent for its close relationship with livelihood. Based on the Chinese household energy consumption survey, a demand function is established to estimate the determinants of residential electricity consumption. With a micro-model, the changes in welfare and redistribution under different scenarios are estimated. From the results, the current subsidy is ineffective; each high-income family receives the cross-subsidy of 35.65 CNY per month, which is 3 times of the low-income family. Price increment leads to less subsidy and deadweight loss but a loss in welfare, and the adjustment in the price on the 1st block is more conducive to the subsidy decline. With a similar overall effect, the non-uniform increase is more effective in subsidy redistribution by widening the price gradients between IBP (increasing block price) blocks and is recommended. Considering the burden of subsidy, the government and the power grid companies are suggested to clarify the pricing scheme to help the public get informed, and thereby, win the support of the public in the energy reform.","1. Introduction
With the economic development and social progress, China’s1total electricity consumption has almost doubled in the past 20 years, ; the consumption per capita has increased from 2729.9 kWh to 5159.2 kWh from 1999 to 2019, close to that of the United Kingdom.2 In recent years, China’s electricity consumption in the residential sector grows faster than in the primary and secondary industries, which contributes 17.9% to the increase in total electricity consumption by 2019. What caused the increase? The main reason is the significant improvement in living standards and leads to expanding demand in material things and com- fort. Meanwhile, the progress in urbanization and the improvement in rural life are promoting the replacement of solid fuels by modern energy, which is the main target of the government nowadays. Moreover, the residential electricity price, which is kept at a low level, is also a major driver, especially for the households who consume excessive power.
In most developed countries, consistent with supply costs, the resi- dents are charged with higher tariff than the industry users (Fig. 1). However, to guarantee the basic needs of residents, the central government advises the power grid companies to charge a higher tariff in the industry and commercial sectors, with less power-supply cost, to make the residential tariff more affordable. In this way, the cross- subsidy emerges and covers the gap in the residential electricity sup- ply and is paid mainly by the industrial and commercial users (Du et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Lin and Jiang, 2011; Lin and Wang, 2020a; Sun and Lin, 2013).
To guide the residents to a more reasonable consumption and to gradually reduce cross-subsidy, China has implemented the Increasing Block Price (IBP) policy since 2012, but the average electricity price for residents across the country has not significantly changed since then, even in a period that both the consumer price index and retail price index have increased (Fig. 2).
On one hand, the tariff for residents is kept at a low level to activate the market and promote economic development. The government has proposed a series of reforming schemes to cut down the prices for in- dustrial and commercial sectors in the past two years. For the general industry and commerce sector, electricity price was reduced by 10% in 2018 and by another 10% in 2019, which led to a reduction of 84.6 billion CNY in the power cost for the enterprises. On February 22, 2020, the State Grid of China released the latest document of exempting 5% from their electricity bill for certain industrial and commercial enter- prises, a plan of cutting down the total bill by 48.9 billion CNY from February to June in 2020 is on schedule.
Before implementing the IBP, a flat low price, lower than the cost of power supply, was applied for many years. While the price is not linked to coal prices or power supply costs. The scarcity of resources as a commodity is not reflected either. Moreover, the non-discriminatory low price setting allows users consuming more electricity to enjoy more subsidies, which stimulates residents’ electricity consumption to earn more welfare from the society, and is not conducive to resource con- servation and environmental protection.
However, even if the price has been kept low for years, there are still residents complaining about the price. In 2019, in the debate on the internet, the central government and grid companies tried to explain the fact of the low price in the residents’ sector in China. As early as when the Chinese government issued the reform document on IBP, there was opposition from the people. The truth is, the residential electricity price is lower than the short-term marginal cost, not to mention the long-term cost of maintaining grid stability and power coverage, but few people have the interest in following up on these bills.
With a lower tariff for the industrial and commercial sector and a residential tariff that remains almost constant, the gap continues to widen by the implementation of the reforming policies. Due to the issue of livelihood, the government is particularly wary when faced with energy market reform in the residential sector. In support of the energy reform by ensuring the livelihood and social stability, the analysis of the pros and cons of the current tariff policy by quantitative calculations is of great significance.
The subsidy is a worldwide phenomenon leading to economic cost and deadweight loss (Burke and Kurniawati, 2018; Cardenas and Whittington, 2019; Khalid and Salman, 2020; Lin and Jiang, 2012; Lin and Wang, 2020a). Given the cost, whether the tariff policy has reached its goal of public service is a question that has raised widespread attention. Based on Kuwait’s residential electricity price, Bushehrih and Wohlgenent confirmed the existence of deadweight loss and proved that the net social benefits go higher with a small increase in tariff. Based on the data of Taiwan, Hung and Chie’s found that a large proportion of subsidies went to non-poor households and concluded that the current tariff policy is not efficient in welfare redistribution (Hung and Chie, 2017). You and Lim discussed the impact of different policies on the welfare of residents in Korea, and argued that the current system is not conducive in resource conservation and welfare redistribution (You and Lim, 2017). Based on the monthly consumption data in Hangzhou city, Liu et al. discussed the redistribution efficiency of residents’ welfare in China under alternative policies and concluded that the pricing designed in 2012 is better than its former mode, even though improvement is needed in the block setting (Liu et al., 2017). The world is dedicated to eliminating energy poverty nowadays, about which the residential electricity is the main topic (Jiang et al., 2020). As the biggest devel- oping country, China’s questions on welfare and redistribution effi- ciency are not only essential for the energy market reform but also an important issue in alleviating the human society’s energy poverty (BP, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
In summary, the objectives of this paper are: 1) to establish the household electricity consumption demand equation in China based on the residential energy consumption survey, and then to estimate the price elasticity of demand for Chinese households; 2) to estimate the impact of tariff changes on subsidy, welfare, deadweight loss, and sub- sidy allocation efficiency, and then to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of alternative price schemes. China is undergoing a new round of electricity market reform, in which the residential tariff is one of the most sensitive and sluggish part, the main contributions of the article are as follows: Firstly, by setting alternative tariffs, we try to find a tradeoff between the gain of the society and the loss in residential welfare. Secondly, the data of provincial or city level only support the study on the summary of subsidy and welfare, and the distribution is hardly analyzed for the lack of group data, as is in previous research. In this study, we use the households data to determine the distribution of subsidy among groups of residents to discuss the fairness and efficiency of subsidies, which is rare in China. The data used in this paper is the 2014 household survey data, which is the latest public data in Chinese Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS). Admittedly, China is developing rapidly, and the living standards of residents are constantly improving, with increasing residents’ electricity consumption, making the electricity consumption situation in 2014 different from today to some extent. However, the electricity price for the residents has seldom changed since the implementation of IBP in 2012, and the average residential price for each province is highly constant. In this way, even that the electricity consumption of each household has increased and the amount of subsidy received is relatively larger, but the relative changes between groups are relatively stable. Therefore, even limited by the data availability, using the 2014 data to conduct research can provide reasonable suggestions for policy implementation.
The basic structure of this paper is organized as follows: the intro- duction and research background are described in Section 1. In Section 2, the data source is introduced and the data preprocessing is explained. Section 3 describes the methods of welfare calculation and the mea- surements on energy poverty, which is used for grouping in the empir- ical analysis. In Section 4, the price elasticity in household electricity consumption is empirically estimated at the first stage. Then with the elasticity, the effects of alternative scenarios on both welfare and sub- sidy distribution are compared. Groups according to income level and energy poverty are also used in this section to analyze welfare redistri- bution. In Section 5 we summarize the main conclusions and policy proposals are recommended based on the conclusions and empirical results.
2. Data description
The data used in this article includes the household survey and the provincial/city-level data. The variables: electricity consumption, house- hold income, family-scale, household appliance, household fuel consumption, housing expenditure, and living area are from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). The residents IBP tariffs, and natural gas prices the mar- ginal costs of electricity supply are public data of the provinces where each household lives, and the data source is the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Temperature is on the city-level, and the sources are the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)5 and are organized by the authors.
The CRECS 2014 was conducted by the Department of Energy Eco- nomics of Renmin University of China, simultaneously with the Chinese general social survey (CGSS) in 2015, which is considered as one of the most important surveys in China. CRECS 2014 covers 3836 urban and rural households from 85 cities of 28 provinces (excluding Tibet, Hainan, Ningxia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), among which 2898 samples are reported as electricity consumers. As the most prolific sur- vey data on residential energy consumption, 115 core questions related to household energy are involved in the questionnaires, along with detailed demographic information, which helps to understand the characteristics and determinants in residential energy consumption in China from the micro perspective of households.
In CRECS 2014, there are two questions related to household elec- tricity consumption, which are “The average monthly electricity bill of your home was __CNY in 2014”(E) and “The average monthly electricity consumption of your home is __kWh in 2014”(Q). An ideal situation is that the answers of E and Q of a family should be consistent if we use either of them to calculate the other with the IBP menu as is illustrated in Fig. 3 and calculated by Eq. (1) to Eq. (3). However, the answers to these two questions do not always match. Therefore, to ensure the reliability and consistency of the results, we take the two questions as trap ques- tions in the survey, and take the samples whose answers of E an Q relatively match as the credible samples by following the methods:
Firstly, by applying the electricity expenditure E, the corresponding usage QE of each household is calculated by Eq. (1) to Eq. (3):
For each household i, we get the electricity expenditure Ei(CNY) and electricity usage Qi (kWh) from the survey, we also get B1i , B2i , (kWh) and P1i , P2i , P3i (CNY/kWh) as the upper limits and the marginal prices of blocks in the IBP menu of the province where the household locates.6 Secondly, by comparing the calculated QE with Q answered by the respondents, the sample could be filtered: When 0.5≤ QE/Q ≤1.5, that is, the error is less than 50%, the sample is considered as a credible sample, and then the untrustworthy samples are dropped.
Then by dropping the samples when the response to core variables are 0 or abnormal, 2022 valid samples are kept for this study. In this way, variables in the filtered sample are more consistent with the normal distribution.
Given the high cost for obtaining information, existing research suggests that residents tend to respond to the average price of electricity which is more easily known instead of the real-time marginal tariff (Borenstein, 2009; Ito, 2014). Based on this conclusion, this article uses the average price of electricity per household as a proxy for tariff, which is obtained by dividing the average monthly electricity expenditure E by the consumption Q. The statistical description of the main variables and the specification for the abbreviations are listed in Table 1. 3. Methodology
3.1. Electricity demand function
Flaig (Flaig, 1990) has proposed the theory of household production, and Filippini (Filippini, 1999) and Labandeira et al. (Labandeira et al., 2012) then integrated the household electricity demand to the model and applied it to the field of energy consumption. According to the theory, households purchase three kinds of goods from the market: electricity, alternative fuels, and capital equipment (home appliances), and combine these goods to produce a series of end products and ser- vices, such as food, lighting, and heating, to meet the needs of the family. According to this theory, household electricity demand depends on electricity prices, alternative fuel prices, household appliance stocks, income, and household characteristics (Lin and Wang, 2020a; Shen, 2014). Therefore, the household electricity demand model could be summarized as Eq. (4),7 and logarithm is applied so that the coefficients could be interpreted as demand elasticities directly: The explanation of the variables in the equation is shown in Table 1, where the subscript i indicates the ith family, εi is the unobserved random error. 3.2. Measurement of welfare and grouping
3.21. Methods for welfare
From existing research (BuShehri and Wohlgenant, 2012; Khalid and Salman, 2020), a micro-model approach is adopted in the study, and the demand curve is assumed as locally linear when the price changes slightly.
We use terminal price and the marginal cost of electricity supply (MC)8 to calculate the price gap, where the terminal price is the actual price paid by energy consumers, which is P0 currently and Pn under alternative scenarios. With the electricity consumption Q, the subsidy S under alternative price policies are presented in Fig. 4 (a) and could be calculated using these formulae: In Fig. 4, the S0 , CS0 and DL0 under current price are presented in the areas filled with stripes, the Sn, CSn and DLn under alternative price are presented in the areas filled with dots, and then, the declines as ΔS, ΔCS and ΔDL are the areas of the polygons with bold lines. By calculating the corresponding areas, the values of the indicators are estimated: where ΔX is a matrix of 3×11, including 3 indicators of ΔS、ΔCS and ΔDL and 11 scenarios from U_10 to U_25 and from MLL to HMM, and the scenarios will be illustrated in the following sections. That is, when ΔS of the full sample is mentioned in the paper, it means the sum of the sub- sidy decreases in the 2022 households. 3.2.2. Methods for energy poverty
As widely applied in existing studies (Belaïd, 2018; Heindl and Schuessler, 2015; Okushima, 2016; Phimister et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2018), “10% indicator” and “Low Income High Cost (LIHC) in- dicator” are chosen to determine that whether a family has the char- acteristics of energy poverty by calculating the energy burden of a family.
The LIHC indicator is computed by satisfying both of the following conditions: where Number of consumption units means the family-scale(FS) in the method of LIHC(cu) and the household living area in the method of LIHC (m2), Eq. (14) means that the fuel cost per unit belongs to the lower 50% in the sample. The data could be obtained from the survey.
The 10% indicator is computed by meeting both of the conditions: to the lower 40% in the sample.
A Household identified by any of the methods is considered as energy poor in our study. From previous work, in developing countries, a house tends to use solid fuels such as coal and biomass fuel as household en- ergy if modern clean energy is not affordable (He and Reiner, 2016; Jiang et al., 2020). Therefore, we classify the situation as unaffordability when the household electricity consumption is lower than the basic demand, and assume that the category is the most vulnerable group to price fluctuation. Otherwise, if the electricity consumption of an energy-poor house is beyond the basic demand, we assume the energy poverty of the house is not induced by unaffordability but rather overconsumption.
By the threshold of basic demand, we divide the energy-poor households into two categories as EP-L and EP-C, which are abbrevia- tions for energy poverty induced by living level (beneath the electricity consumption lifeline) and energy poverty induced by overconsumption (the basic need for electricity is satisfied), and the threshold is determined by the minimum end-user (MEE) method (Barnes et al., 2011; He and Reiner, 2016; Khandker et al., 2010).
To make the estimation more concise, we directly apply the value in our previous study as 113.75 kWh/household (Lin and Wang, 2020b). The grouping method of energy poverty is demonstrated in Fig. 5.
3.3. Scenario design: alternative prices
Theoretically, IBP solves the problems of unfairness and inefficiency (Borenstein and Davis, 2012). On one hand, by encouraging high-income households to subsidize low-income families through differentiated prices, IBP could improve social equity and increase the revenue of power supply. On the other hand, IBP also promotes energy saving and emission reduction with the guide of price signal (Lin and Chen, 2018; Liu and Lin, 2020; Zou et al., 2020).
According to the Guidelines on IBP(NDRC2012), each province (autonomous regions and municipalities) has designed a three-block IBP menu. To guarantee the lifeline demand of the low-income people, the first block of each province covers 80% of its residential users, while the second block covers the users from 80% to 95% quantile, and the third block is designed to encourage electricity conservation and to subsidize the first-block users whose tariff is below the costs. The price in the second block is 0.05 CNY/kWh higher than in the first block, and the price in the third block is 0.3 CNY/kWh higher than the second (see Fig. 3).
The low prices currently have led to the subsidy leakage problem, that is, residents who can afford their electricity bill, or even those who consume excessive household energy, have received a large proportion of subsidy, and this phenomenon induces the problem of inefficiency (Du et al., 2015; Lin and Jiang, 2012; Sun and Lin, 2013).
To discuss the performance in welfare and efficiency of alternative prices, this article sets up a series of scenarios of price increases, including equal-proportional or uniform increases for the three blocks (U) and differentiated-proportional or non-uniform increases (NU).
The setting of Us is mainly to discuss the changes in the total welfare when price increases uniformly. And the scenarios of non-uniform price increases are set according to the government’s document on household IBP direction, which suggests to adjusting the 2nd-block price to cover the cost and reasonable revenue of electricity supplying after the tran- sition period of IBP reform.
The parameters set in each scenario are listed in Table 2, where P1, P2, P3 denotes the initial IBP price for each block, and P1n, P2n, P3n de- notes the reformed price. For easy comparison, the letter H, M, L means the extent of price change in a specific block, for example, MLL in the first non-uniform scenario means a medium price increase in the 1st block, a low price increase in the 2nd block and a low price increase in the 3rd block.
The setting of MLL is mainly to compare the performance with U_10
and discuss the price adjustments in the 2nd and 3rd blocks when the 1st block price is slightly increased.
The setting of LMM and LHH is mainly to discuss the difference in the effects of the price adjustments in the 2nd and 3rd blocks while keeping the 1st-block price constant, by comparing the results of LMM and LHH, we can discuss the effects of the price change in the higher blocks on redistribution.
HMM is a situation where the prices in all blocks change in unequal proportions and are used to compare the performance of efficiency with a U scenario whose ΔS is close to HMM. Moreover, given the different settings in the 1st-block prices of LMM and HMM, while tariffs in higher blocks are similar, the effect of 1st-block price reform could be discussed.
4. Empirical results
4.1. Price elasticities
Due to the IBP, the average price is related to the consumption Q,
which would induce potential endogenity in the demand analysis, therefore, the instrumental variable is considered in this paper to address the problem. Referring to the work of Zhang and Liu (2015), an IV approach is utilized in this paper: using the multinomial logit model and the data of Q, P1, P2, P3, INC, FS, CDD and p g to simulate the process of selection in residential behavior. Firstly, we estimate the probabilities of the impacts in the selection of the three blocks, then we obtain the predicted consumption as an instrumental variable of price with the regression previously estimated. This approach is also used in existing studies (Barkatullah, 2002; Dahan and Nisan, 2007; Moffitt, 1986). According to the demand function of Eq. (4) in section 3.1, by using the IV approach and 2SLS to deal with the endogenity, the estimation results is listed in Table 3. Compared with the OLS result, the coefficient of electricity price is not consistent and the coefficient of CDD is significantly positive in the 2SLS result, while other coefficients are similar, especially for INC and AP. From column OLS, price imposes a positive impact on demand, which is inconsistent with the demand theory. Since the assumption for OLS is that all the independent vari- ables in the model are exogenous, otherwise, the estimation is biased and inconsistent, and the parameters of regression are regarded as incredible. In column IV, the price elasticity is − 0.886, which means a 10% increase in tariff would cut down 8.86% of consumption: the de- mand is inelastic to price change. The income elasticity is 0.169, and the number of home appliances and the cooling degree days (above 28 ◦C) also have a positive impact on usage. Natural gas affects the electricity consumption by substitution: when the natural gas price increases by 10%, the demand for electricity increases by 4.7%, which means that residents might turn to electricity to satisfy their needs when natural gas is expensive, but the substitution is inelastic.
4.2. Welfare effects of alternative prices
Referring to the National Energy Administration of China, the data of household electricity consumption, average residential tariff, and average marginal price of electricity supply for all sectors are listed in Table 4. The marginal price of electricity supply is the price by adding up with the average sale price and government-managed funds. By calcu- lation, the subsidy expenditure accounts for 0.14% of the GDP of China in 2014, equivalent to 3.47% of the revenue of the two major power grids.9 The survey data represent a similar subsidy rate with the national integral data, so in the next step, the sample data will be used to estimate the performance of different prices and to reflect the condition of the nation.
According to the method in section 3.2.1, the changes in consump- tion and subsidy are calculated and the results are illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 (a) depicts the ΔQ, ΔS, ΔCS and ΔDL in the 11 scenarios. In scenarios of uniform increase(U), the decreases in Q, S, CS and DL grow with price, and the changes in percentage are listed in Table 5. An in- crease in tariff would efficiently cut down the quantity of subsidy and deadweight loss, but on the other hand would lead to the loss in resi- dential welfare, which is depicted in consumer surplus. To make it more obvious of the relative change between subsidy and welfare, Fig. 6 (b) is plotted in which the ΔCS/ΔS denotes the cost of a decline in welfare if one unit of subsidy is cut down and ΔCS/ΔDL denotes the cost of a decline in welfare if one unit of deadweight loss is cut down. Despite the augment in ΔS and ΔDL when the price goes up, the ΔCS/ΔS and ΔCS/ ΔDL also rise slightly, which means the cost for subsidy cutoff is rising to some extent with the price, which should be taken into consideration if the policy of price increase is implemented. 4.3. Effects on redistribution efficiency
To further investigate that who is mostly subsidized, we divide the sample into groups by two methods: 1) according to household income, we divide the households into three groups namely; the Lower 40%, the Middle 40% and the Upper 20%; 2) according to the estimation on en- ergy poverty, the households are divided into non-EP, energy poverty induced by living level (EP-L) and energy poverty induced by over- consumption (EP-C). The statistics of main indicators by groups are listed in Table 6.
Table 7 describes the distribution of subsidy in different groups under the current policy, where the average household electricity con- sumption in the Upper 20% is almost twice that of the Lower 40%. The result is partly attributed to the direction that “the first and second blocks should cover 95% of the residents’ electricity consumption” by the central government to guarantee the access to modern energy; as the electricity prices in both blocks are lower than the cost of power supply, the more electricity used, the more subsidies are received. From the results estimated, each household in the Upper 20% receives an invisible subsidy of 35.65 CNY per month, and the subsidy rate reaches 23.04%, which is the highest among the three groups. On the contrary, the Lower 40% only receives a subsidy of less than 1/3 of the Upper 20% in each house, and the subsidy rate is lower than the average level. As the most vulnerable group, the EP-L families consume electricity at a level less than a half of the non-EP families, and the income is only 15% of the non-EP (Table 6 (b)). Therefore, from the perspective of energy poverty, the current distribution of subsidy is even more unreasonable. In the EP- L houses, the average income is significantly lower than other types, and the electricity consumption is lower than basic demand (113.75 kWh/ month), however, as the families who are supposed to receive the sub- sidy most urgently, each EP-L houses only receive 7.85 CNY per month, which is only 1/3 of the non-EP households. That is to say, the subsidy for residential electricity is largely going into the houses who are affordable, but for the energy poor, who cannot afford to enough modern clean energy, the benefit of subsidy is little. The current elec- tricity price design does not effectively subsidize the people in need, but instead allows the high-income and non-energy poor families to enjoy a higher subsidy.
To further explore the feasibility of scenario settings, we estimate the distribution of subsidies in each group. As in Fig. 7 (a), when the prices in all blocks are raised by 25% uniformly (U_25), the subsidies are reduced by 14.01 CNY, 20.57 CNY and 31.18 CNY in Lower 40%, Middle 40% and Upper 20% per household, which means a 98.26% reduction compared with the current subsidy as is in Table 5. However, with a greater impact on low-income households (Fig. 7 (b)), U_25 might easily lead to the unreasonable phenomenon that the high-income homes are subsidized by low-income homes.
From Fig. 7 (b), the rates of subsidy removal in each group could be compared. In the case of the uniform increase, the removal rate in the subsidy of the Lower 40% is the highest among the three groups, while the Upper 20% is the lowest. With a severe impact on the poor families, the uniform increase in tariff is not conducive to the redistribution of social welfare. As to the non-uniform price increase, the settings of LMM and HMM bring up with benign output that the removal in subsidy is higher in richer families and lower in poor houses. For U_17.5 and HMM, which have similar overall effects (the average subsidy reduction rates of the two scenarios are 73.3% and 75%), the reduction rates of the two scenarios in the three groups from low to high income are 87.9%, 71.3%, 65.1%, and 64.1%, 73.5%, 84.7%, respectively; the reduction of sub- sidies for high-income families is greater under HMM, indicating a more conducive price setting for subsidy redistribution. When the 1st block price increase is small, comparing U_10 and MLL, higher 2nd and 3rd
block prices are favorable for welfare redistribution. Compared to LMM, LHH has higher 2nd and 3rd block prices, and a constant 1st block price same as LMM; LHH is more effective in cutting down the subsidy in low- income groups than middle-income groups (Fig. 7 (b)). It can be seen that for welfare redistribution, higher 2nd and 3rd block prices do not always work, for that the rises in the 2nd block prices also impact on the low-income populations.
From the perspective of energy poverty, the redesign of electricity
prices in all scenarios reduces the subsidies for EP-C households most (Fig. 7 (a)), followed by the subsidies for non-EP. This is mainly due to the significantly higher consumption of these two groups. From the subsidy decline rate (Fig. 7 (b)), the removal rate of EP-L is higher than that of non-EP in both the U scenarios and the MLL scenario, which means that these price settings do not well protect susceptible families in energy poverty. Under LMM and LHH, due to the constant 1st block price, the overall removal effect is not obvious, but on the other hand, the EP-L populations are well protected and the other groups are made to share most of the reduces in welfare. Unfortunately, given that the reduction in non-EP is low, the burden for the EP-C was too heavy. In the case of HMM, the reduction rate in overall subsidy is 75%, and 75%, 84%, 49%for the non-EP, EP-C and EP-L households respectively. That is, when the subsidy reduction rate is controlled below 50% for the most vulnerable houses (the EP-L houses), HMM can reduce the subsidy by 24% more than MLL(Table 5). If the reform of HMM is applied, the overall subsidy declines by 75%, which means a benefit of 66.75 billion CNY in 2014. In that case, each rich house is going to return 30 CNY per month to the society, while the poor house is going to return only 1/4 of that. For the energy poor whose electricity consumption cannot meet the basic demand, the decline in subsidy per month is less than 4 CNY. This scenario depicts a blueprint in which the affordable households are giving back the money to the society, and this creates a possibility for the government to rearrange the money by other fiscal methods to help the people in need.
4.4. Discussion
4.4.1. Comparison of the scenarios
According to the results of the empirical analysis, the advantages and the shortcomings of the price settings could be concluded as following; (2) For uniform increases, the cost of consumer welfare for subsidy cutoff is rising with price, which indicates that the cost perfor- mance declines when the price is raised. But for non-uniform increases, price structure attributes to the differences.
(3) The uniform increases are not helpful in subsidy redistribution, but LMM and HMM perform well in this aspect: when the 2nd- block price is adjusted to cover the cost and reasonable revenue of electricity supply, redistribution is realized, and the subsidy cutoff increases if the 1st-block price is raised. However, lifeline energy poor would be affected by the tariff reform if the 1st-block price is increased.
(4) Performance of subsidy cutoff in scenario U17.5 and HMM are similar, but HMM performs better in redistribution: a reasonably wider gap between blocking prices tends to be helpful.
4.4.2. Policy adjustment since 2014
In the view of the diversity of urban/rural living styles, for the big households with relatively more family members, a higher upper limit for the first block in IBP is allowed. For example, Beijing stipulates that the limit for the first block will be increased by 100 kWh per household per month if a family has 6 or more members, and the family-scale for Shandong province and Tianjin is 5. Since that the IBP is calculated by household, one household with more members increases the risk of paying higher-block electricity fees. While larger families are more likely to gather in rural areas, the contradiction of insufficient electricity consumption per capita and excessive electricity burden might drive the family into energy poverty. The implementation of this policy is of great significance to the protection of energy-poor households.
To adapt to the increasing residential electricity consumption year by year, provinces have calculated the coverage of households of the blocks. According to the Guidance of the National Development and Reform Commission, volumes of the blocks have been adjusted in many provinces: in 2016, the volumes of all three blocks were increased in Fujian and Guizhou, and the volumes in Liaoning were also lifted in 2017. In 2018, Hunan Province also increased the first-block volume, to ensure that the first block covers 80% of households. The adjustment is mainly to guarantee the general service function of electricity and the basic electricity demand for residents. But in short it is devoted to the welfare of all groups and does not promote the distribution of subsidies.
5. Conclusion and policy implication
Based on the Chinese household energy consumption survey data, a multinomial logit model was used to obtain an instrumental variable for household’s average electricity price, and a demand function is estab- lished to estimate the price elasticity as − 0.886. The nationwide cross- subsidy in 2014 is calculated as 89.05 b CNY (0.13 CNY/kWh) with a subsidy rate of 18.74%. Based on current tariff, by applying the elasticity into a micro-model, a series of scenarios are set to estimate the changes in residential welfare and distribution of subsidy, to explore a price scheme which is effective in subsidy reduction and welfare redistribu- tion. According to the results, the main conclusions and corresponding policy implications are summarized as the following:
Firstly, the price increment is conducive to energy conservation and subsidy reduction, but the welfare estimated by consumer surplus is at loss (Fig. 6 (a)). When the 1st block price is kept unchanged, the dif- ference in price adjustment in the 2nd and 3rd blocks affects the subsidy, deadweight loss and welfare (LMM and LHH). But the effect is less 
significant when compared to the cases in which the 1st block tariff is raised. For the sake of the high coverage of the 1st block (80% of households), if the price of it remains constant, the effects on usage, subsidy, welfare is limited even when the 2nd block price is raised to the marginal cost of supply (LMM). That is to say, if subsidy reduction is necessary indeed, it is inevitable for the policymakers to adjust the price on the 1st block. Given that the vulnerable groups such as the economic poor and energy poor are inevitably affected by the price adjustment in the 1st block, correspondent methods should be taken as protection for these households; economical subsidies or coupons could be helpful. Just like the current policy implementation, the preferential policies for electricity use proposed by the central government and implemented by local governments for economically poor and potential energy-poor groups are highly effective, such as equipment subsidies and price dis- counts for coal-to-electricity households, big volume of first-block of IBP for big families, and 10 kWh/15 kWh free use of electricity for the economically poor households per month. It is worth noting that the current clean heating renovation is still limited to the northern areas where winter temperatures are relatively lower, while central heating and clean heating in the south is also an unavoidable problem, and this may be the next issue that should be considered in the people’s liveli- hood policy.
Secondly, due to the low pricing, the current subsidy is aimless and wasteful for it is more likely to be allocated to the high-income houses for their high consumption. Unreasonably, a rich house receives a sub- sidy 3 times of a low-income house, surpassing the average by 77%; an EP-L house, whose usage in electricity is below the lifeline and most likely to turn to the solid fuels for living, is only subsidized by 7.85 CNY per month, less than 40% of the average. If the reform of HMM is applied, the overall subsidy declines by 75%, which means a benefit of 66.75 billion CNY in 2014. In that case, each rich house is going to re- turn 30 CNY per month to the society, while the poor house is going to return only 1/4 of that. For the energy poor whose electricity con- sumption cannot meet the basic demand, the decline in subsidy per month is less than 4 CNY. This scenario depicts a blueprint in which the affordable households are giving back the money to the society, and this creates a possibility for the government to rearrange the money by other fiscal methods to help the people in need and to further develop the green energy industry to control the carbon emission.
Thirdly, a uniform price increase is not conducive to distribution efficiency, and might even lead to an abnormal phenomenon that the poor subsidize the rich. While the performance on the overall effect is similar, compared to U_17.5, HMM is more effective not only in subsidy reduction but also in subsidy redistribution across groups. According to our results, the policymakers, especially the local government who are the final designer of the electricity price, are suggested to focus more on the non-uniform increase and widen the blocks of IBT at a reasonable level according to the actual situation of its economic development and people’s living standards. However, limited by the scale of data, price elasticities by groups are not estimated. Referring to existing studies, where the price elasticity grows with income, the changes in usage and subsidy might be larger than the results in this paper. Therefore, to be more prudent, the advanced estimation will be conducted in our future study.
Some of the policy adjustments in recent year, such as the big vol- umes of the first block in IBP for the big families and the implementation of the coal-to-electricity clean heating policy, are conducive to the effective distribution of subsidies and have reasonably protected the vulnerable groups. However, the adjustment of volumes of IBP in some provinces is mainly to reflect the general service function of power, which is required by the Guideline of the central government. In fact, according to the central government, the price is suggested to be kept at a low level during the initial stage of IBP within three years, and it is recommended that the second-block price could be gradually adjusted to a level that compensates for the cost and reasonable benefits of power companies. Entering the ninth year of IBP, facing the climate and environmental pressure, gradually reflecting the scarcity of resources and compensating for the cost of the environment might be the future direction of price reform.

28,"Power market reform in China: Motivations, progress, and recommendations","China's electricity demand has grown rapidly over only two decades and is currently the largest in the world. This was largely owing to a framework of regulation in which governments regulated prices and quantities, and there was ample incentive for investment. As the growth in electricity demand has slowed and the use of renewable energy has been impeded by integration-related challenges, China has embarked on a new round of power sector reform, with a focus on market construction. Considering four years of market experiments at the provincial level, we review the backgrounds and goals of the reforms, as well as the current progress toward meeting the initial targets. Then, we discuss the key challenges to be overcome to achieve complete implementation of the reforms, with special emphasis on the system of dispatch. We recommend that China's reforms, in order to achieve the goal of market-based competition, must embrace short-term markets, a greater role for independent regulation, compatibility with renewable energy, and inter-provincial coordination.","1. Introduction
Beginning around 2000, China’s power system began growing very rapidly, achieving annual generation growth rates of 12.2% in the first decade and 7.1% in the second decade, compared to the world average of 2.5%. China overtook the U.S. in 2011 to become the world’s largest power sector. In 2017, the total electricity generation in China reached 6495 TWh, accounting for 25% of the world’s total (BP, 2018), as shown in Fig. 1.
Compared to the development of the industry, China’s market-based power sales mechanism remains in its infancy. Although China took the necessary steps of vertically unbundling grid and generation companies in the last round of power sector reform that began in 2002, sales have since largely gone through the state-owned grid companies, and the prices of electricity on the supply and demand sides have been strictly regulated by the government. As the central issue for China’s power sector in the last few decades has been the gap between the rapidly growing demand and a shortage of power supply, the primary goal for power industry development was to stimulate generation and trans- mission investments, with almost no consideration for market efficiency improvement.
However, the traditional power industry structure has become incompatible with China’s new economic and industrial environment of lower but more sustainable growth, denoted by the government as the “New Normal” (Chen and Groenewold, 2018). Accordingly, certain major problems have emerged, such as low generation asset utilization, low energy efficiency, high pollutant emissions, and the serious curtailment of renewable energy. Inefficiencies have been amplified for industrial and commercial customers by cross-subsidies embedded in regulated (plan-based) sales that help lower prices for agricultural and residential users (Yang et al., 2018). To address these problems, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCCPC) and the State Council of China (SCC) jointly issued the “Several Opinions on Further Deepening Electricity System Reform” in March 2015 (CCCPC and SC, 2015), commonly referred to as “Document No. 9”. This offi- cially marked the beginning of China’s new round of power sector re- form, hereinafter referred to as “the new reform”.
The tasks of the new reform are extensive and include (1) promoting the reform of the electricity pricing mechanism, (2) establishing the market-based electricity transaction mechanism, (3) establishing rela- tively independent power exchange centers, (4) promoting the reform of annual generation planning, (5) promoting the reform of the electricity retail market, (6) promoting the reform of distributed renewable gen- eration, and (7) further improving market supervision. A detailed description of Document No. 9 can be found in the review by Zeng et al. (2016b). The most fundamental and significant content of Document No. 9 is the goal of establishing a “fair, normative, efficient, competitive, open-access, and non-discriminative” electricity wholesale market to trade electricity through a market-based mechanism (NDRC and NEA, 2015a).
Since the advent of the new reform, China’s power market con- struction has made some obvious achievements. At present, all prov- inces and autonomous regions in China have established power exchange centers to support market-based electricity transactions and to construct the wholesale forward market. Among them, eight provinces and autonomous regions have made rapid progress and have begun construction and trial operation of the wholesale spot market. In 2018, the sum of all market-based electricity transactions in the wholesale forward market in China was 2065 TWh, accounting for 30.2% of the total Chinese electricity consumption (CEC, 2019a).
With the continuous advancement of power sector reform, China has now entered a crucial period for both the reform and power market construction. At this juncture, it is useful to provide a comprehensive review of current progress, analyze existing problems, and consider the direction of future development. In recent years, there have been some studies discussing the motives, measures, and significance of China’s power sector reform. Soon after the release of Document No. 9 and prior to its implementation, Zeng et al. reviewed Document No. 9 in consid- eration of the aspects of the pricing mechanism, planning mechanism, renewable energy utilization, and the responsibility of grid companies (Zeng et al., 2016b). Alva and Li provided perhaps the most detailed summary of the context and key aspects of the new reform (including supplementary documents), as well as emphasizing international expe- riences relevant to the reform process (Alva and Li, 2018). Wu et al. discussed the power market reform in China from the perspective of accountability relations between the central and provincial governing authorities (Wu, 2019). Wu et al. investigated the effect of imbalance settlement design in China’s spot power market with large proportions of long-term non-financially contracted electricity (Wu et al., 2020). From a regulatory economics perspective, several “pitfalls” of China’s electricity market pilots (prior to spot market introduction) have been analyzed, focusing on contract structure, system operation, and regu- lation (Davidson and P�erez-Arriaga, 2020).
Transitioning from China’s traditional regulation to a wholesale market has the potential to generate large stranded costs (Lin et al., 2019). Yuan et al. proposed three alternative designs of coal generation subsidies under the market reform circumstances to overcome the ef- fects of stranded costs (Yuan et al., 2019). Liu and Jin identified the interactions among electricity, fossil fuel, and carbon market prices in Guangdong province, offering implications for the co-development of power market reform and emissions trading schemes (Liu and Jin, 2020). There have also been several studies analyzing how the new re- form could influence various aspects of power system operation, such as demand-side management (Zhang et al., 2017), renewable energy integration (Guo et al., 2019b; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018), retail market operations (Bai et al., 2015; Peng and Tao, 2018), financial market construction (Fan and Qu, 2019), and interregional electricity transmission (Zeng et al., 2016a).
Recent studies also provide further empirical analyses on general topics related to the power market reform, e.g., market power mitigation (Guo et al., 2019a), renewable energy participation in the market (Du et al., 2019), stranded coal assets (Ansari and Holz, 2020; Bos and Gupta, 2019), and compatibility with other markets (Zhao et al., 2018). These studies do not exclusively focus on China, but are highly relevant to certain important issues that have emerged in China’s power market reform, as we discuss later.
Four years into the new reform, with market experiments underway and deepening in all provinces—and several in advanced stages—this paper gives a critical snapshot of reforms in action, as well as a retro- spective look back on reformers’ motivations and the progress toward meeting these goals. Our focus is on power market construction, and we elaborate on key factors as well as clear descriptions of the various market types and how they relate to operations. To this end, we examine very recent developments in Guangdong’s pilot spot market. Finally, we conclude with a comprehensive set of recommendations including, but not limited to, market design, transition mechanisms, and interactions with other energy and climate regulations.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyze the background and motivations behind the new reform. In Section 3, we describe the expected post-reform power market structure and summarize some important events during the reform. In Section 4, we provide details on the progress of reform and discuss the power ex- change center, market participants, and wholesale markets, including the forward market, spot market, and ancillary services market. In Section 5, we summarize the challenges currently faced by the con- struction of wholesale markets. In Section 6, we provide recommenda- tions for the future development of China’s power market. Section 7 concludes this review.
2. Background and motivations
2.1. Background of China’s power system
The development of China’s power sector has always accompanied the rapid development of China’s economy. From the opening of China’s electricity market in the late 1970s until the 1990s, China’s power sector was a vertically integrated monopoly that also maintained regulatory functions. Electricity prices were mainly regulated, and there usually existed a shortage of the power supply. In 1997, the Chinese government achieved the institutional reform of power investment, and the tight supply was initially relieved.
To break the business model of a vertically integrated power sector and form a new market-based pattern of power resource allocation, the Chinese government launched the previous round of reform in 2002 to shift the power industry from “vertical integration” to “single buyer” (SC, 2002). Since then, the former State Power Corporation (SPC) has been split into two major power grid companies, five major power generation groups, and four significant power auxiliary groups; their structure has been presented in detail by Alva and Li (2018). Subse- quently, China’s power market structure has gradually shifted into the structure shown in Fig. 2. The sole grid company (GridCo) is in charge of purchasing electricity from generator companies (GenCo) and selling to consumers at regulated prices. The transmission company (TransCo) and the distribution companies (DisCo) belong to the GridCo, and there is no clear internal demarcation. To increase trading efficiency further, the government allowed GenCos and select large industrial consumers to conduct direct power purchasing (DPP) in some provinces (SERC, 2004). However, after the last round of reform, the power sales mechanism in China is still highly regulated in terms of both price and quantity.
On the one hand, electricity prices are regulated and determined by the government. Before a power plant is constructed, a GenCo must submit the economic information for this project to the local govern- ment. Then, a negotiation occurs between the local government and the GenCo to determine whether the power plant should be built and what the on-grid price would be. Once the on-grid price is determined and the power plant starts to run, there is limited scope to adjust the on-grid price. Thus, GenCos cannot easily compete by adjusting their prices.
On the other hand, the quantity generated is also regulated and determined by the government in compliance with the “fair dispatch rule” (Gao and Li, 2010). Specifically, local government departments (generally the provincial commission of the economy and informatiza- tion) assess the electricity consumption in the second year and allocate a total power generation amount to each power plant based on an approximately equal quota rule. Then, the generators sign an annual generation contract with the government based on the allocation and the regulated on-grid prices approved by the provincial development and reform commission. Under this “fair” principle, for example, thermal power generators with different technologies and costs share similar capacity factors. In actual operation, the GridCo must formulate the dispatching schedule based on the annual contracts and dispatch the generators based on the dispatching schedules. In fact, the space for adjustment in real-time operations is small, which makes it difficult to integrate variable renewable energy.
The absence of a market-based sales mechanism also results in a lack of incentives to provide related products other than energy. In the traditional regulated power sales mechanism, for example, there is no market-based ancillary services market. The provision of ancillary ser- vices1 is seen as an obligation of the GenCos in accordance with the dispatch instructions, but without appropriate rewards. In the short term, owing to the lack of strict assessment and profitable rewards for providing ancillary services, the GenCos prefer to provide energy, which is more profitable, and attempt to use information asymmetry to avoid ancillary service liability, such as reporting false information about their generators’ operation status (Zeng et al., 2014). In the long term, owing to the lack of guidance from price signals, the incentives for flexible investment are reduced, resulting in insufficient ancillary service resources.
The absence of a market-based pricing mechanism also hinders interregional and interprovincial transactions. To solve the problem of uneven resource distribution, China proposed the “west-to-east power transmission” to transport the electricity produced in the west to the east by constructing UHV lines, thereby achieving a broader range of resource optimization. However, without a market-based sales mecha- nism, it is often difficult for the sending and receiving provinces to reach an agreement, making it particularly problematic to efficiently transport renewable energy over long distances. It is estimated that 40% of China’s renewable energy curtailments come from the impact of inter- provincial transaction barriers (Shu, 2017).
Despite its many disadvantages, China’s highly regulated power sales mechanism has been effective in an environment of rapid economic and electricity demand growth and long-term scarcity of electricity supply. In this context, the regulated power sales mechanism generated stable generation revenue expectations, attracted capital to achieve rapid capacity growth, and ultimately met the power demand of China’s economic development with limited shortages. However, in recent years, as China’s development entered a “New Normal,” slowing de- mand has exposed many problems with the inefficient regulated power sales mechanism. In order to shift from meeting rapid demand growth to promoting more efficient economic and social development, in 2015, China launched the new round of power sector reforms.
2.2. Motivations of the new reform
Countries choose to restructure their traditionally vertically inte- grated electric utilities for various reasons, which can depend on the level and pace of economic development, availability of finance for new investment, industry structure, and governmental institutions (Williams and Ghanadan, 2006). In the case of China, many problems existed before the new reform, which have been discussed in many studies, such as the distorted pricing mechanism and inefficient utilization of renewable energy (Zeng et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2018). Because the new reform encompasses many components and is the result of a long deliberation process with a large group of stakeholders involved, there are several underlying motivations. As participants in policy-making of the new reform, we analyzed all relevant government reform docu- ments, including the 2015 announcement and supplementary docu- ments (see Table 4), key government official statements, and industry data and performance trends, and identified four key, direct goals of the new reform:
● Increase generation asset efficiency
● Decrease energy consumption and pollutant emissions ● Develop renewable energy
● Decrease industrial electricity prices
2.2.1. Increase generation asset efficiency
In the past decade, China has maintained average annual growth rates in new capacity as high as 9.2% (see Fig. 3). However, this increase in capacity was not accompanied by a corresponding growth in demand, resulting in dramatic declines in thermal generation capacity factors. From 2011 to 2016, the annual capacity factors of thermal power decreased from 57.9% to 46.6% (CEC, 2012, 2017). Furthermore, the capacity factors of power generation equipment in China are signifi- cantly lower than those in other large countries, such as the U.S. (see Table 1). The situation is more serious in certain Chinese provinces, such as Henan and Guangdong. In 2018, the capacity factors of thermal gener- ators in these provinces were only 44.4% and 46.8%, respectively (CG, 2019). In comparison, in the PJM power market in the United States, the capacity factor of thermal generators reached 54.7% in 2018 (IMM, 2019).
The main reason for the excessive investment in China’s power generation assets lies in the investment approval mechanisms and price setting rules of the traditional Chinese regulated power sales mecha- nism. Without a market-based electricity price serving as a reference, local governments generally cannot make informed decisions on elec- tricity price setting or generation planning, which might result in dis- tortions in the on-grid price and inefficient generation capacity investment. In past decades, owing to the rapid growth in power de- mand, even if the power generation capacity were rapidly expanding, an acceptable capacity factor could be guaranteed. However, in recent years, the growth rate in power demand has gradually slowed, and the problem of overinvestment has become acute, resulting in the efficiency of power generators being reduced substantially.
Therefore, an essential goal of the new reform is to establish a comprehensive power market system that provides price signals for power supply investments at different times and in different locations, and effectively improves the capacity factor of power generation assets.
2.2.2. Decrease energy consumption and pollutant emissions
Since China’s “Eleventh Five-Year Plan” (2006–2010), “energy conservation and emissions reduction” has been an important criterion for the development of China’s energy system. Achieving this goal has often relied on the elimination of inefficient production capacity (Chen et al., 2011). According to the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Electricity Development” (NDRC and NEA, 2016), the average unit coal con- sumption for electricity supply by 2020 must decrease to 310 g/kWh, and the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides must decrease by 50%.
However, the traditional regulated power sales mechanism has, to some extent, affected the realization of the “energy conservation and emissions reduction” goal. As a problem stemming from the “fair dispatch rule” mentioned earlier, the average coal consumption rate in electricity production was 366 g/kWh in 2006, which is 50 g/kWh higher than the level in the advanced world (Gao and Li, 2010).
To address this problem, some provinces in China have implemented the energy-saving power dispatch (ESPD) reform, which sets the dispatch merit order of generators based on their energy efficiency (i.e., fuel consumption) level to best achieve the target of energy-efficient and low-emissions power generation. In 2012, the national average coal consumption for electricity generation decreased to approximately 325 g/kWh, which was 11.2% below that in 2006 (Zhong et al., 2015).
However, several issues hinder the direct application of ESPD across the whole country. First, there are still some inefficient generators protected by local governments and grids, thereby weakening the effects of ESPD. Second, the dispatch merit order is an average metric, which is usually adjusted on an annual basis. Without a real-time metric, the optimization for low coal consumption cannot be guaranteed. Third, because ESPD is a fuel-based, not cost-based, dispatch mechanism, system costs are not necessarily minimized.
Establishing a comprehensive power market mechanism offers a way to solve this problem. Because efficient and renewable generators usu- ally have more competitive operation costs, they are more likely to be cleared in a market-based power sales mechanism, which will achieve a balance between economic operations and environmental conservation.
2.2.3. Develop renewable energy
To achieve China’s sustainable development goals, the Chinese government has formulated a number of policies supporting renewable energy (SGCC, 2018). In recent decades, the installed capacities of wind power and solar energy have respectively increased by 44% and 191% annually, which are far higher than the global average growth rates (Shu, 2018). According to the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Electricity Development” (NDRC and NEA, 2016), renewable energy must account for 31% of the total generated electricity and 39% of the total installed capacity by 2020. By the end of 2018, China’s clean energy installed capacity had reached 696 GW, which represented nearly 30% of the world’s total installed capacity (IRENA, 2019). Its annual clean energy generation reached 1776 TWh (CEC, 2019b), which was more than the total electricity consumption in the Middle East and Africa (i.e., 1693 TWh) (Enerdata, 2019). The fractions of wind power in major Chinese wind provinces are comparable to other major wind regions in the world (see Table 2).
With the large deployment of renewable energy, curtailment has become a key issue in China’s power sector. IEA, 2016, the curtailment ratio of wind was 17.1% (Qi et al., 2019), and the total curtailed renewable electricity was close to 110 TWh, which equaled the full-year electricity consumption of the Netherlands in 2016 (BP, 2018). In some provinces, renewable energy curtailment was much more severe. For example, in 2016, three provinces had wind curtailment ratios over 30%, and two provinces had solar curtailment ratios over 30% (see Table 3).
The reasons for renewable curtailment are complex. First, in the traditional regulated power sales mechanism, coal-fired generators receive an annual government-set quota that should be met by grid companies through its dispatch (discussed below). Second, renewable energy curtailment is uncompensated, and in the absence of a short-term market or optimization, on-grid prices for renewable energy, which are 0.40–0.57 RMB/kWh (57–81 $/MWh) for wind and 0.55–0.75 RMB/ kWh (78–107 $/MWh) for solar, are thus higher than those for coal-fired generators, 0.26–0.45 RMB/kWh (37–64 $/MWh), which does not provide appropriate incentives to maximize integration (NDRC, 2016, 2017a, b). Third, the lack of short-term optimization of energy and ancillary services leaves potential flexibilities and efficiency gains un- tapped. Fourth, interprovincial transaction barriers decrease the areas over which renewable energy can be integrated.
Therefore, an important goal of the new reform is to establish a renewable energy-friendly power market system to regain renewable energy price competitiveness, and to provide demand, support, and a platform for its integration.
2.2.4. Decrease industrial electricity prices
According to the 2016 statistics, the average electricity price of China’s industrial and commercial enterprises was 107 $/MWh, which was higher than that of most developing countries and even some developed countries. For example, the average Korean industrial and commercial electricity price was 101 $/MWh, and the average U.S. in- dustrial and commercial electricity price was 70 $/MWh (IEA, 2016). Considering China’s relatively low resource and labor costs, its indus- trial and commercial electricity prices are even more expensive in comparison (Brandt and Rawski, 2019). High electricity prices have placed a heavy burden on the development of China’s industry and commerce.
As discussed above, the regulated electricity price system, cross- subsidy policy, low utilization rate of power generation assets, high energy consumption per unit of power generation, and high curtailment of renewable energy all contributed to the relatively high industrial and commercial electricity prices in China. Therefore, an important goal of the new reform is to establish a comprehensive and efficient power market system to decrease the transaction costs of the traditional regulated power sales mechanism and achieve the goal of further reducing electricity prices. Premier Li Keqiang set a goal of reducing the average price for industrial and commercial electricity by 10% in each of the last two years (Li, 2018, 2019).
3. Reforms
China launched a new round of power sector reform in March 2015, aiming to build a comprehensive and efficient power market system. Once this round of reform has been completed, China’s power market structure is expected to have transformed into that shown in Fig. 4. Trading in the power market is mainly conducted through the power exchange center, and the power dispatch, transmission, and distribution remain the responsibility of the GridCo. On the supply side, GenCos compete to sell electricity directly to retail companies (ReCos) and large consumers. On the demand side, the transmission and distribution net- works are open to all market participants without distinction. Thus, the ReCos could participate in the market on behalf of consumers without owning a distribution network or could choose to build a distribution system to serve specific consumers and avoid high transmission and distribution prices. In addition, for protected consumers such as resi- dents, agricultural users, public utilities, and public services, the GridCo
still provides regulated power supply services.
To achieve the goal of power sector reform, since 2015, various de-
partments, principally the National Development and Reform Commis- sion (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA), have issued policies to promote the reform, see Table 4.
4. Progress
Since the launch of the new reform, all provinces in China have implemented policies to promote the construction of the power market. A typical reform path widely adopted by many provinces, such as Guangdong and Zhejiang, is as follows: (1) build a forward (physical) market, expand market access, increase the amount of market-based electricity trading, and cultivate participants’ market awareness; (2) build an ancillary service market to provide services for frequency regulation, energy reserve, and others, and a peak regulation market might also be envisioned before the operation of a spot market, depending on the situation of renewable curtailment; (3) build a spot energy market closely integrated with the forward market, which could be a mixture of financial and physical contracts, achieving full market competition; (4) build a capacity market, financial forward markets such as futures and options, and others. The reform path is illustrated in Fig. 5. At present, the provinces exhibiting the most rapid reform, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shanxi, have entered the third stage.

28,"Power market reform in China: Motivations, progress, and recommendations","China's electricity demand has grown rapidly over only two decades and is currently the largest in the world. This was largely owing to a framework of regulation in which governments regulated prices and quantities, and there was ample incentive for investment. As the growth in electricity demand has slowed and the use of renewable energy has been impeded by integration-related challenges, China has embarked on a new round of power sector reform, with a focus on market construction. Considering four years of market experiments at the provincial level, we review the backgrounds and goals of the reforms, as well as the current progress toward meeting the initial targets. Then, we discuss the key challenges to be overcome to achieve complete implementation of the reforms, with special emphasis on the system of dispatch. We recommend that China's reforms, in order to achieve the goal of market-based competition, must embrace short-term markets, a greater role for independent regulation, compatibility with renewable energy, and inter-provincial coordination.","4.1. Power exchange center
According to the reform requirements, the power exchange center plays an important role in the power transaction procedures. All centralized power transactions should be conducted through the power exchange center. As for bilateral contracts, participants must submit their signed contracts to the power exchange center for a security check. Provincial market transactions are conducted through the provincial power exchange center, and interprovincial and interregional markets operate through the national power exchange centers. By the end of 2018, two national power exchange centers and 32 provincial power exchange centers (covering all provinces of mainland China) had been established.
The organizational structures of provincial power exchange centers can be divided into two categories: joint-stock enterprises controlled by the GridCo with other minority ownership stakes (e.g., Guangdong, Shanxi, Yunnan) and wholly owned subsidiaries of the GridCo (e.g., Zhejiang, Shandong, and Hebei).
Relying on the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and China Southern Power Grid Corporation (SCG), China has established two national power exchange centers located in Beijing and Guangzhou. The national power exchange centers are mainly responsible for imple- menting interprovincial and interregional transactions and national directives.
4.2. Market participants
The market participants mainly include GenCos, ReCos, and con- sumers. Since the reform, the number of market participants has grad- ually increased, and by the end of 2018, the number of registered market participants in SGCC’s areas exceeded 68,000, comprising 28,000 GenCos, 37,000 consumers, and 3000 ReCos.
4.2.1. Generation company
At present, most types of generation, such as thermal, hydropower, nuclear, wind power, and photovoltaic, can be traded in power markets, although market and participation rules generally vary. For example, several provincial power markets such as Hubei and Henan have mini- mum capacity limits on generators, such as restricting participation to plants larger than 200 MW.
An obvious oligopoly-dominated phenomenon occurs in most pro- vincial markets, in which the largest GenCo occupies a significant market share, as shown in Table 5. Therefore, the largest GenCos could abuse their market power if not appropriately regulated.
4.2.2. Consumers
Initially, only industrial and commercial consumers were allowed to participate in power markets, whereas other consumers, including res- idents, governments, and research institutes, continued to be supplied by GridCos at the regulated prices. There were also requirements for industrial and commercial consumers to participate in the market, such as minimum voltage levels or annual electricity consumption. For example, the current voltage level requirement for consumers in many provinces, such as Guangdong, Shandong, and Anhui, is 10 kV. The annual electricity consumption requirements for consumers in Henan is 10 GWh.
As power market construction progressed, the requirements for consumers were eased. Residents, agricultural firms, public utilities, and industrial power consumers with voltage levels below 10 kV were gradually allowed to participate in the market through the agency of ReCos.
The number of registered market-participating consumers has increased every year. Taking the Guangdong power market as an example, the number of registered consumers increased from 5634 in 2017 to 9148 in 2018. At present, the proportion of consumers partici- pating in markets has reached 90% by number in Guangdong (GPEC, 2019).
4.2.3. Retail company
There are two main ways for consumers to participate in the market: by direct transaction or through ReCos. The latter has been the major approach for consumers with small market shares: first, a consumer signs a contract with a ReCo, determining its electricity purchase prices and quantities; then, the ReCo participates in the wholesale market on behalf of the consumer. ReCos operate under loose requirements, and the main regulations focus on the ReCos’ financial security and risk management.
As the volume of market-based electricity transactions continues to
increase, the number of ReCos and their transactions as agents are also increasing. In 2018, the volume of agent transactions through ReCos exceeded 200 TWh, accounting for nearly 10% of the total market-based electricity transactions (BJX, 2019). In some areas, the ReCos have developed more rapidly. Taking the Guangdong power market as an example, 6907 consumers participate in the market through ReCos’ agent transactions (GPEC, 2019).
4.3. Forward market
One crucial mission of the new reform is to construct a power market that integrates a spot market with China’s various forward markets (NDRC and NEA, 2015a). The spot market and the forward market are distinguished by their trading time scales: the spot market has transactions on a daily or shorter time scale, whereas the forward market sees transactions beyond the daily time scale.
At the beginning of the power sector reform, most provinces had insufficient conditions to run a spot market. Thus, most provinces launched a power market by first building a forward market. Without real-time optimization from the spot market, the contracts signed in China’s forward markets are mostly in the format of physical energy contracts that determine only a price and total amount of energy, which must later be decomposed into power curves and accurately imple- mented in the real power system dispatch. These are fairly different from both financial contracts and self-scheduling of physical contracts, which are used in mature power markets, such as PJM or CAISO in the U.S. Financial contracts, in particular, only affect transaction settlements and are not considered as an input to the power system dispatch.
There are two types of transactions in provincial forward markets: DPP and forward contract transfers. The former refers to the direct purchase and sale of electricity between GenCos and consumers or ReCos, and the latter refers to transferring DPP contracts, priority gen- eration right contracts, and generation quotas.
DPPs mainly take the form of physical energy contracts. First, a contract is signed between a producer and a consumer to determine the amount and price of the transacted electricity. Then, after approval following the dispatch centers’ safety checks, the contract becomes valid. The transacted electricity is only determined by energy quantity (kWh) and most often without a specific power curve (kW). Thus, the dispatch centers or participants must decompose the transacted elec- tricity quantity into a monthly energy quantity and later into a daily energy quantity. The participants are allowed to further decompose the daily energy quantity into time-varying power curves and report to the dispatch center, or the dispatch center decomposes the daily energy quantity into time-varying power curves based on a historic profile of the system demand; this produces a daily dispatching schedule. In actual operations, the dispatch center will dispatch the generators based on the daily dispatching schedule, trying to ensure that the daily energy quantity is met exactly. In the case when the decomposed daily energy quantity is not exactly met, the deviation will be shifted into the daily energy quantities of later days. A detailed execution procedure for physical energy contracts is summarized in Fig. 6.
It should be noted that spot markets around China are under con- struction. When a spot market is established, market participants will be allowed to choose an execution pattern from the physical or financial patterns for their forward contracts.
In 2018, the amount of transacted electricity in the provincial power markets was 1688 TWh, accounting for 81.8% of the total amount of forward-transacted electricity (CEC, 2019a). Fig. 7 shows the market-based trading power and proportion in some provinces in China with data available (CEC, 2019a).
It can be observed that four provinces have market-based trading ratios greater than 40%: Yunnan, Liaoning, Western Inner Mongolia, and Jiangsu. The provinces with market-based trading power exceeding 100 TWh are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang, Western Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and Henan.
Interprovincial and interregional forward markets include power transactions between two power grids, interprovincial and interregional DPPs, and interprovincial and interregional forward contract transfers. Specifically, the content of the DPP and forward contract transfers are essentially the same as those in the provincial forward market. The power transactions between two power grids mainly refer to policy- based electricity transactions such as west-to-east power transmission. In 2018, 347 TWh of electricity was transacted in the interprovincial and interregional forward markets, of which the electricity sold in the Southern Grid through west-to-east power transmission was 217 TWh and mainly represents clean energy from Southwest China.
4.4. Spot market
In 2017, the NDRC & NEA issued a document proposing the con- struction of several pilot power spot markets around China, including South China (starting with Guangdong), Western Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Sichuan. At present, the tentative market construction schemes and market operation rules of spot markets in most of these provinces have been initially completed, and some provinces have started simulation and trial operation of spot markets. To provide a clear view of China’s spot market, this review adopts the Guangdong spot market as an example.
Guangdong is the province with the largest economy and electricity consumption in China. In 2018, its total electricity consumption reached 632 TWh, which was approximately 10% of China’s total. In addition, the Guangdong spot market is China’s fastest-growing spot market and is conducting trial operations with real settlements.
According to the spot market operating rules issued by the Guang- dong Power Exchange Center (GPEC, 2018a), the power spot market in Guangdong province shares many similar characteristics with the power pool model represented by the PJM power market (Ott, 2003; PJM, 2019). These similar features include a market clearing price in the format of a locational marginal price (LMP), market participants sub- mitting bids and offers, two stages of a day-ahead market and a real-time market, and a forward contract that works similarly to financial con- tracts and only has effects on market settlements.
However, the Guangdong spot market also has several major dif- ferences from other markets: (1) Limited generator participation: At present, only coal-fired and gas-fired generators are allowed to partici- pate in the market. Nuclear power, wind power, photovoltaic power generators, and generators outside Guangdong are not allowed to participate in the market at this time and are still dispatched in the traditional mode. Their output is only used as the boundary condition for market clearing. (2) Limited consumer participation: Currently, the bids from consumers only include declared demand quantities without prices. (3) Average price used for demand settlement: To decrease the risk of high and fluctuating prices in the preliminary stages of the spot markets, LMPs are only used for settlement on the supply side, and weighted average prices are used for settlement on the demand side. (4) No virtual bidding: There is no virtual bidder, as is common in the power pool market, in the Guangdong spot market. All market participants in the spot market are entities that truly generate or consume electricity. (5) No co-optimization of ancillary services: Ancillary services are not co-optimized with the spot energy market. Specifically, the Guangdong spot market first clears the spot energy market and then clears the ancillary services market. (6) No separate real-time auction: The same offers and bids submitted by market par- ticipants in the day-ahead market are used for the real-time market, without an opportunity for adjustment. (7) Narrow bidding price ranges: The price ranges of bids and offers are much narrower than those in common power pool markets. For example, bidding prices for generators are mainly constrained to the ranges from zero to twice their regulated on-grid prices.
On August 31, 2018, the Guangdong power trading exchange center first launched a market simulation operation for evaluation (not for settlement). On May 15, 2019, the Guangdong power trading exchange center began market operation with results used for settlement. The average price curves of the day-ahead and real-time markets in the spot market on May 15 are shown in Fig. 8. The clearing prices of the Guangdong spot market range from 0.08 RMB/kWh (12 $/MWh) to 0.45 RMB/kWh (65 $/MWh), and the real-time prices are mostly higher than the prices of the day-ahead market. The large divergence between day- ahead and real-time prices during certain hours is mainly due to the lack of a separate real-time auction and limited participants.
In addition, to promote renewable energy integration further, the Beijing and Guangzhou Power Exchange Center also organized inter- provincial and interregional day-ahead incremental transactions, spe- cifically for sending renewable energy from West China to East China on a daily basis. This market is operated as follows. On the day before the operation day, each provincial GridCo submits their expected interpro- vincial renewable energy supply and power demand. Then, the national power exchange centers clear the markets and determine the interpro- vincial dispatch schedule for the operation day. On the operation day, the national power exchange centers continuously adjust the market clearing results based on the deviations of the renewable energy supply and power demand, thereby producing the final interprovincial dispatch schedules. These will be sent to each GridCo to serve as the boundary conditions for provincial power optimization. The volume of interpro- vincial and interregional day-ahead incremental transactions through the Beijing Power Exchange Center in 2018 reached 9 TWh (BJX, 2018).
4.5. Ancillary services market
Ancillary services are an essential part of maintaining safe and stable operation of the power system, consisting of frequency regulation, automatic generation control, reactive power regulation, energy re- serves, and black start, among others. Because there are no market- based ancillary services in the traditional regulated power sales mech- anism, an ancillary service regulated transaction mechanism was proposed by the government for market participants to make payments for ancillary services (Zeng et al., 2014).
In 2018, 4176 GenCos provided ancillary services, with a total installed capacity of 1325 GW (69.7% of total generation capacity). The total payment for ancillary services was $1.40 billion, equivalent to 0.54% of the total payment for electricity generation. Comparatively, the cost of ancillary services in the PJM market in 2018 was $654 million, equivalent to 2.2% of electricity generation costs (IMM, 2019). This suggests that regulated ancillary services in China are under compensated. Frequency regulation and reserves account for 43.8% and 45.0%, respectively, of total ancillary service costs (see Table 6).
In 2017, the NEA issued a document (NEA, 2017) requesting the construction of ancillary service markets and further identifying eight provinces or regions, including Northeast China, Shanxi, Fujian, Shan- dong, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Guangdong, and Gansu, as pilots for ancillary service reforms.
To provide a clear view of China’s ancillary service market, this re- view adopts Shanxi’s reform as an example. In 2017, the Shanxi Energy Regulation Office (SERO) released the construction plan for an ancillary service market (SERO, 2017), stating that a co-optimized ancillary ser- vice and energy market would be built in two stages:
(1) First stage (2017–2018): Start the construction of ancillary ser- vice market including frequency regulation and explore the market- based operation mechanism of reactive power compensation and black start ancillary service.
(2) Second stage (2019–2021): When the spot market is operating, the reserve product will be introduced into the ancillary market. Then, the Shanxi power exchange center will co-optimize the operation of the spot energy market and the ancillary market, which includes reserve and frequency regulation. At the same time, reactive power compensation and black start ancillary services will be transacted based on market- based bilateral negotiation transactions.
4.6. Peak regulation service
In China’s traditional power dispatch, there is an additional category of service designed to assist with managing supply and demand on a daily basis in the presence of significant physical energy contracts as well as renewable energy. This “peak regulation” service is typically classified as an ancillary service in China, although it is distinct from common understandings elsewhere of ancillary services. Uncompen- sated peak regulation happens as a normal process of decomposing en- ergy quantities into power curves as shown in step 6, Fig. 6. Compensated peak regulation may be called upon when the system is in the valley period and generators must be dispatched further down. This may increase heat rates and costs of generators, and owing to the lack of a short-term market or cost minimization, additional incentives are given to thermal generators that reduce output during these periods (Alva and Li, 2018).
In 2014, Northeast China established a day-ahead market for peak regulation services that allows for one-sided bidding from allowable thermal generators to indicate their desired price per kWh for reducing outputs below the administrative thresholds, typically 50–54% of the rated capacity. The clearing price for peak regulation is determined by the marginal thermal unit required in real-time given the load and renewable energy availability. Compared to the former regulated compensation price for peak regulation, significantly more thermal generators participated in the market and reduced their power outputs. For example, from 2017 to 2018, an additional 3 GW of power gener- ation space was opened up in total for wind power (Alva and Li, 2018). Part of the reason for this was the much higher compensation received by coal plants: during the first three years of operation, the average peak regulation price was 0.43 RMB/kWh (61 $/MWh), which was on par with the on-grid tariff for generated electricity (Liu et al., 2017). In 2018, with the expansion to several other regions of China, the total size of peak regulation service reached $767.7 million.
5. Challenges
During the rapid development of the power sector reform of China, several challenges have appeared, such as legal and regulatory barriers for power markets, appropriate methods for addressing stranded costs, difficulty in motiving consumers to participate in markets, pressure to avoid future potential localized power shortages, market participation rules to allow high renewable penetration, and difficulty in integrating power markets with diverse designs.
5.1. Legal and regulatory barriers
Although the central government has issued many documents on power sector reform, these are highly general, leaving significant au- tonomy in formulating power sector reform programs to provincial governments, which are also the primary overseers of the new markets. Relevant supporting laws specifying regulatory authorities and enforcement are still insufficient. The lack of strong independent regu- latory supervision creates loopholes for rent-seeking, and few avenues for recourse by affected parties. Many markets begin trial operation prior to making the designs accessible to a wide range of actors. Transparency is also needed in the implementation of traditional power dispatch because, for example, the power curve decomposition shape of regulated electricity has a direct impact on spot market prices and the fairness of market operations.
5.2. Stranded generator costs
There many problems with stranded costs that need to be resolved. For example, in the traditional regulated power sales mechanism, when the government approves GenCos’ applications for power plant con- struction, they are guaranteed average generation hours as determined by each year’s demand and supply. The average number of generation hours might fluctuate between years, but remains roughly consistent for different generators. Power market reforms create competition by gradually decreasing these planned electricity contracts. In this case, some high-cost generators will generate less and may find it difficult to recover their sunk costs. Designing competitive power markets given potential stranded costs is a problem affecting virtually all restructuring efforts elsewhere (FERC, 1996). In China, owing to the high levels of over-permitting of generation capacity under traditional regu- lation—particularly in recent years (Ren et al., 2019)—fixed cost re- covery is particularly challenging without substantial out-of-market payments to generators (Lin et al., 2019).
5.3. Protected consumer classes
Residential, agricultural, and various other classes of consumers receive cross-subsidies from regulated industrial and commercial con- sumer tariffs. These protected consumers currently do not participate in the market and have no incentive to do so, because their rates would likely rise on average. This issue is common in other developing coun- tries that have provided low-cost electricity as a means of poverty alleviation (Jamasb, 2006). It will be necessary to mobilize more con- sumers to participate in the market to increase the quantity of supply and demand in the market and gain further efficiencies. However, it is currently challenging in China to address the social goals of protecting these consumers while introducing market mechanisms.
5.4. Threat of future localized power shortages
In the traditional regulated power sales mechanism, generation in- vestment was controlled by the government and typically exceeded the rate of demand growth, leading to ample reserve margins. With the introduction of power markets, electricity prices have lowered, weak- ening the incentives for new generation investments and revealing potentially large overcapacity. At the same time, some areas in China have seen significant volatility, diverging from national trends in elec- tricity demand growth. For example, while national growth was stag- nant in 2015, demand in Shandong grew by over 20% (see Fig. 9). Given the barriers to inter-provincial trade as well as the large distances over which supply and demand must be balanced, the potential for future localized power shortages under current low investment incentives cannot be ignored.
5.5. High renewable energy penetration
Although renewable energy curtailment rates have shown some improvement over 2017–2018, continued expected growth based on government targets as well as lower long-term demand growth pro- jections imply that this issue is far from resolved. In other systems, renewable energy is challenging the implementation of certain elec- tricity market designs, given the range of political goals for the sector (Pollitt and Anaya, 2016). There is still debate in China as to the nature of renewable energy’s participation in the market, which could have long-term consequences for both the efficiency of the market as well as curtailment. If renewable energy does not participate in the market, its scheduled power output will follow the traditional dispatch mechanism with all of its flaws outlined above. If renewable energy does participate in the market, Chinese regulators will need to determine rules on bid- ding, forecasts, and imbalance management. In either case, its low operational costs and supply volatility will lead to an overall decline in market prices as well as greater uncertainty for other market participants.
5.6. Diverse power market designs
Thus far, power markets in China have been designed and con- structed by provincial governments in various ways, including among the eight spot market pilots. For example, the power spot markets in Guangdong and Zhejiang are more focused on the optimization of the whole system (consisting of a large, mandatory pool with financial forward contracts), whereas the spot markets in Sichuan and Fujian are more focused on adjustments in the daily dispatching plans (more akin to an imbalance mechanism with significant physical forward con- tracting). The high diversity and potential incompatibility among the rules of provincial power markets will make it difficult to integrate them and accomplish a higher level of optimization in the future.
6. Recommendations
The new reform has been in place for four years. In the context of a completed provincial forward market and the trial operation of certain provincial spot markets, we propose a series of recommendations for China’s future power sector reform.
6.1. Enhance market regulatory institutions and establish a legal framework
First, the strength of central regulatory officials in the NEA and NDRC in overseeing local market designs should be further increased. For example, regulatory officials should have strengthened authority to evaluate—and reject if necessary—the detailed rules for provincial market construction to prevent loopholes that allow rent-seeking. Sec- ond, the construction process, detailed designs, and operating data of provincial markets should be selectively open to the public to ensure third party market monitoring and appropriate social supervision. Third, the related laws and regulations need to be revised according to the issued documents, providing a legal and stable foundation for power sector reform. 6.2. Confront stranded cost problems with transparent transition guarantees
Without a doubt, many prospective market participants view with hesitation—and may oppose—changes to the regulatory regime that would affect both future and existing investments. Whereas the risks of all new investments after market reforms are inaugurated should be borne by market participants—arguably, this should apply to new fa- cilities since 2015—investments (e.g., in generator plants) made prior to market regulation require transition mechanisms that help mitigate the potential for stranded costs. Ideally, these should be transparent, time- delimited, and not affect proper market functioning.
6.3. Reduce the role of the government in price and plan setting
Although 30% of electricity consumption is transacted through market-based methods, a large volume of electricity is still transacted under traditional regulation. Governments need to further decrease their role in price and plan setting by reducing the volumes of annual gen- eration plans, raising upper limits on market transactions, reducing intervention in the price-setting of power markets, and liberalizing the entry barriers for consumers to participate in the market. These changes will lead participants, both GenCos and consumers, to participate in the market more competitively, thereby helping to achieve efficient out- comes. The transaction volumes in the forward markets will increase, which will reduce the deadweight loss from the double-track market system. In addition, a high level of market-based transactions will also facilitate the smooth adoption of spot markets.
6.4. Establish a comprehensive power market system
Most electricity markets in China are based on physical forward contracts that must be carried out by the grid in its scheduling opera- tions. A spot market is necessary for dispatch to efficiently respond to changing supply and demand conditions. In addition, a comprehensive power market system would also include ancillary services and com- plementary forward markets. The introduction of this suite would simplify the current system and make certain transient trading products, such as peak regulation, obsolete. On this basis, other supportive mar- kets that are crucial in mature power market systems elsewhere, such as capacity markets, financial transmission rights, and virtual bidding could then be integrated into China’s power market system.
6.5. Design mechanisms in consideration of renewable energy
To adapt to the high penetration of renewable energy in several provinces, the power market mechanism should be designed in full consideration of the characteristics of renewable energy. First, renew- able energy should be allowed to participate in the market. Second, to address the intermittent and uncertain characteristics of renewable en- ergy, markets should be designed with significant granularity in location (i.e., nodal) and time (i.e., sub-hourly dispatch, with possible intraday markets). With the high competition from low operating costs and renewable-friendly market mechanisms, renewable energy will be easily cleared in the power market, thereby decreasing renewable energy curtailment. Third, markets for distributed renewable energy also need to be built, and these could fairly evaluate the value of distributed renewable energy and properly compensate renewable energy suppliers. To achieve a higher level of resource optimization, it is necessary to integrate provincial markets into larger regional markets. This requires two steps. First, the interprovincial and interregional linkages and transactions must be expanded, thereby increasing the connections among the provincial markets. Second, the market rules in neighboring 
provincial markets must converge, especially with respect to the market type, transaction sequence, and settlement models.
6.7. Improve compatibility with other new regulations
Independent of the power market reform, there are other important new regulations to be introduced that mainly target the power sector, e. g., the national CO2 emissions trading scheme led by the Ministry of Ecological Environment and the renewable portfolio standard led by the NEA. Therefore, it is crucial to coordinate the design of these polices to ensure that policy interactions with the power market reform would not undermine the overall economic efficiency. For example, the national emissions trading scheme must account for indirect emissions from electricity use for industrial firms if the power market reform has not deregulated the industrial electricity price to pass through the increased cost of electricity generation when both the thermal power and indus- trial sectors are included in the emissions trading scheme. The renew- able portfolio standard also needs to incentivize more interregional transmission to reduce the overall costs to increase the share of renewable energy in China’s grid at the national level.
7. Conclusions and policy implications
China’s experimental reforms of power markets at the provincial level have made great strides toward achieving the goals of the 2015 reform agenda—to increase generation efficiency, reduce pollution, develop renewable energy, and lower industrial electricity prices. These experiments have also revealed many challenges that are faced when transitioning away from a largely government-directed regulatory regime. Whereas markets are important, the exact nature of the market as well as the supporting institutions, such as the regulator, matter even more. We find ample room for deployment of markets toward achieving these objectives, but the pathways must emphasize China’s historical context—dispatch mechanisms, inter-provincial coordination, and investments under traditional regulation—to be successful.

29,Reform and renewables in China: The architecture of Yunnan's hydropower dominated electricity market,"Reforms currently under way in China's electricity markets bear important implications for its decarbonization objectives. The southwestern province of Yunnan is among the provinces piloting the current iteration of power market reforms. As such, lessons from Yunnan will inform future market reform and renewable energy policies in China and potentially elsewhere. The dominance of hydropower in Yunnan's energy portfolio and the particular transmission constraints it faces, offer an interesting case study of the challenges of decarbonization. We report on market architecture reforms and aggregate market data collected from the Yunnan Power Exchange. We review four elements in the reformed market architecture. Market pricing rules, transitional quantity controls, the generation rights market, and inter-provincial trade. The specifics of market reform reflect a compromise between decarbonization, inter-provincial competition, grid security and development objectives and contribute to understanding of how the dual transitions of hydropower decarbonization and market liberalization interact. We conclude on six insights regarding the role of the grid operator, security checks on trade, integration of cascade hydropower, the inclusion of renewables in the generation rights market, price controls, and market participant price uncertainty.","1. Introduction
Energy conservation and emissions reduction in China is both a domestic need as well as part of the country's commitment to the in- ternational community [1]. This is particularly important in the Chi- nese power industry. Since the economic reforms of the 1980's, China has enjoyed rapid economic growth, urbanization, and poverty alle- viation. These transformations have been supported by rapid growth in electricity generation and consumption [2]. The cumulative installed power generation capacity of China reached 1.519 Terawatts by the end of 2015, ranking it number one globally and accounting for about 23% of the world's total installed capacity [3]. Coal-based thermal power accounts for nearly 65.9% of China's installed power generation capacity. The power industry is responsible for 57.9% of total carbon emissions and 34.6% of total sulfur emissions [4]. As a result, seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world are in China [5].
In order to move to a low carbon economy, development of clean and renewable energy has become part of national policy. The country boasts the largest installed renewables capacity and has taken a leading role in international climate negotiations [6–8]. In the last two decades, China saw rapid development of its hydropower capacity, rising from 20 GW in 1980 to 330 GW in 2016. An increase of more than 16 fold. Hydropower is the largest source of renewable energy in China, ac- counting for 20.9% of China's installed capacity [9].
Deploying renewable energy has a set of generic issues; inter- mittency, interconnection, energy storage, peaking capacity, and stranded assets amongst others [10–12]. Although renewables deploy- ment is happening rapidly, a key issue highlighted by the State Council in its 2015 Opinions on Further Deepening the Reform of the Electric Power Systems: Document No. 9 is that the usage of that renewable capacity is not keeping up [13]. In northern China, rapid wind capacity deploy- ment meant that at one point, as much as one third of wind capacity was not connected to the grid and that the capacity factor for China's wind power in 2006 and 2007 was 0.16 (compared to OECD members achieving 0.2–0.3) [14,15]. Inefficiencies also occurred in the rapid deployment of hydropower. Due to poor energy planning, lagging power grid construction, falling demand, and gaming between different interests, hydropower generation in southwest China was curtailed by more than 25 TWh in 2015 [16]. In 2016, 28.7 TWh of hydropower was wasted in Sichuan alone [17]. Officially published values for aban- doned water and energy spillage exceed 60 TWh [18]. In Yunnan, it has been reported that wasted hydropower grew from 5 TWh in 2013 to 31 TWh in 2016 [19]. Wasted clean and renewable energy is a serious problem for China's hydropower, one which partly motivates electricity market reform, namely promoting hydropower consumption via the establishment of intra- and inter-provincial markets.
In the complex framework of China's power system and the specifics of Yunnan's oversupplied hydro-dominated electricity portfolio, the building of electricity market faces many challenges. The literature on China's policies promoting renewable energy is rich and lively. One area of interest is that of dispatch reform and its role in better utiliza- tion of renewable resources [20–23]. Other contributions have eval- uated the effectiveness of feed-in-tariffs and renewable portfolio stan- dards among other mechanisms implementing renewable energy legislation [24]. These are largely considered successful but not always well integrated with economic reforms in electricity [25,26]. Among very recent contributions, one investigated the effect market reform has on the utilization of distributed renewables and found institutional barriers exit to employing market flexibility potentially required for decarbonization and the adoption of intermittent generation [27].
This paper examines the effectiveness of power market reforms in China's Yunnan Province for efficient use of hydropower to facilitate the attainment of the country's decarbonization objectives. We begin with brief reviews of the theory of market reform and the history of China's electricity markets to highlight salient factors in market reform and then turn to examine Yunnan's electricity market architecture in detail. We report aggregate data from the first year of trading on the Yunnan Power Exchange (YNPX) trading platform [28] highlighting four salient reforms to market architecture: 1) Pricing mechanisms and controls; 2) Transitional quantity controls; 3). Tradable generation rights; and 4) Interprovincial trade. This paper illustrates how market reform inter- acts with decarbonization and other objectives in the case of the ar- chitecture employed in Yunnan's market reform trial. How quickly and efficiently renewables are adopted will depend on the specifics of market reforms and the mechanisms these employ to that end [27]. We show how Yunnan's market rules are locally adapted to suit Yunnan's particularities (hydro-dominated supply, oversupply, and stagnant consumption growth). Finally, we show how the choice of market rules involves a balancing of interests which does not always create the cir- cumstances most suited to renewables deployment and conclude on six potential areas for further reform.
2. Theories of market reform and its architecture
To reflect on market reform in China generally, and in Yunnan specifically, it is worth reviewing theoretical and practical issues in electricity market reform. Free market advocates argue central planners lack information needed for efficient resource allocation [29]. Instead, the argument goes, market prices send appropriate signals about prof- itable investment which ultimately fulfil social needs efficiently. Pro- ponents of central planning might respond that the market does not reflect all necessary information either. Commensuration of all values under a monetary unit of account results in strategic, social, or en- vironmental needs remaining unaccounted for. Under central planning competing needs are considered in their own valuation (be it physical quantities or otherwise) and planners allocate resources to meet these needs as far as possible [30]. When markets fail, vertical integration, regulation or government control can be more appropriate [31,32].
The choice between markets and planning is one of deciding which transactions happen under which institutions [33]. Questioning the sources of transaction costs can inform this decision for any given transaction. The first question is whether investment is required in as- sets specific to the participants in the transaction. Given asset specifi- city, parties to the transaction become mutually dependent for the ef- ficient use of this asset. This issue is related to market-failure under monopoly which emerges when consumers of a product or service do not have a substitute or alternative producer to switch to [34–36]. The monopolist can then use this power to push prices over costs and generate monopolistic profits. The incentive for abusing this depen- dence to extract additional rents from the counter-party generates a transaction cost and makes a spot market an inappropriate structure for the transaction. A second question is that of the social cost of a market approach. If substantial safeguards are deemed imperative for pro- tecting against costly market adjustments, then regulation and control is required and neither a spot market nor long-term contracting are efficient [33].
A monopoly occurs in electric utilities where a single power dis- tribution infrastructure is required (e.g., in a city or urban district) which makes competition impossible [37,38]. In the case of network- level electricity markets, trade in electricity does not require a specific investment as there are typically multiple buyers and sellers in the market. However, investment in a transmission network does. The grid cannot supply anyone other than the connected buyers and sellers. Likewise, generators and consumers are dependent on the grid operator for market access. Instead of spot markets, procurement of network infrastructure is done through long-term contracts, strict regulation, or direct ownership and control [39].
Transitions from planning to electricity markets suffer from issues of market power, particularly in regulating the transmission network [38,40–42]. A “textbook architecture” for competitive electricity mar- kets recognizes competition will not be possible in transmission [38]. Firms owning transmission networks must therefore be separated (or “unbundled”) from generation and retail. If not, they could give pre- ferential treatment to their generators or otherwise exploit their control over transmission. The architecture therefore envisages independent regulators mandated to set charges grid users pay to trade on the net- work which the grid operator receives. Regulators must pressure op- erators to offer an efficient service while being sufficiently capitalized for investments needed in grid expansion, improvement and main- tenance [36,37,43]. The regulator must be independent so as to not be influenced by either consumers, producers, or the grid operator as each may seek to influence pricing and regulation in their favor.
3. History of electricity reform in China
Different eras have been identified in the history of China's power sector reforms. A recent study considers 6 periods since the founding of the People's Republic of China, identifying decarbonization as a con- temporary strategic objective which does not sit comfortably alongside existing development and reform objectives [1]. Older reviews focused on the reforms after the initial market opening in the mid 1980's, and found another distinct period after the 2002 reforms [44–47]. The most recent reforms are marked by the 2015 issuance of Document 9 by the State Council [48]. Although the history of power market reform in China has already been covered in detail in these historical accounts, it is worth highlighting recurring themes relevant to Yunnan's efforts at market reform.
One issue is that of decentralization. During the 1980's central government responded to power shortages by reducing its control over electricity planning, allowing provincial governments to make invest- ment decisions [44,49–51]. These reforms raised capital and relieved power shortages but newly empowered provinces sought to protect local investments through barriers to inter-provincial trade while in- dependent generators were still disadvantaged relative to state com- panies [49]. This decentralized approach to capacity expansion was contentious because of ensuing incoherent planning but has remained in place under Document 9 [13]. This relates also to renewables de- ployment which Document 9 states should be promoted, noting how- ever that further utilization of renewable electricity through inter- provincial trade is encouraged but will happen under the guidance of local governments [13,48]. While other rules have been established to promote renewable energy, institutional barriers remain in practice.
Another recurring issue is that of market power. Sector governance was revamped between 1997 and 1998 as part of a broader reorienta- tion towards a socialist market economy. The Ministry of Electric Power, was dissolved and its functions and personnel were transferred to the newly established State Power Corporation of China (SPCC). Corporatization did not however promote competition [41,49]. Be- tween 1998 and 2000, the SPCC in fact replaced or incorporated all regional power companies and all provincial power companies [44,52]. This failure of the 1997 reforms constituted one of the core objectives of reforms in 2002 [44,53]. The SPCC was then broken into 2 grid com- panies (the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and the China Southern Power Grid (CSG)) as well as 5 generating groups. Today, distributors are largely still subsidiaries of the grid and Document 9 states that further unbundling will happen gradually [54]. Document 9 quite explicitly recognizes the competing issues of grid stability and market opening and makes no illusion about the relatively limited de- gree of free competition to be pursued under the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), pushing instead for a gradual and orderly transition from plan to market [13].
Previous reform trials suffered from problems in both decen- tralization and market power. In 1999, the SPCC and its regulator se- lected 6 provinces for transmission unbundling and market liberal- ization trials but local generators were still sheltered from competition by the SPCC and the following year the State Council suspended these trials [44]. Between 2003 and 2006, markets trials in the Northeast China power pool and by the CSG were all ultimately called off due to difficulties in integrating pre-existing regulated contracts with the new market contracts and a lack of clarity over market rules and the bidding process [50]. Plans for further trials on the North China and Central China grids were also aborted. On the Central China grid this was due to large quantities of hydropower, differences in government set prices and tariffs across provinces, and other institutional difficulties [50]. The SGCC established an exchange center in 2006 as part of these re- form trials [44]. The regulators were however uninformed about this and there was subsequent criticism that the establishment of market exchanges directly under grid control allowed it to set market rules and retain de facto control over generators. In 2013, a new set of provinces (including Yunnan) were selected for market reform trials which began in 2015 [44,50].
A third issue recurring in China's electricity reform is regulatory independence. As part of the 1997 reforms, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) took over central economic planning, including setting prices for projects and furthering the reform agenda [44]. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) was also established as the sector regulator, although it was initially under-re- sourced and too closely related to the SGCC to regulate independently [44,49,52]. Earlier reviews and Document 9 all highlight that reg- ulatory independence remains an important issue [13,22,49,50]. Prices for transmission and distribution continue to be determined by the NDRC after negotiation with the grid operator. The NDRC is also tasked with setting wholesale and retail electricity prices as well as transmis- sion charges and so faces a balancing act between competing interests along the value chain.
Document 9 sees electricity prices increasingly being set by markets
between generators and large consumers, although public services and other targeted sectors will remain under NDRC prices. Document 9 highlights that NDRC prices often lag behind changes in costs and that planned prices do not reflect all relevant factors adequately [13]. Market price mechanisms are then to be explored but not single- mindedly pushed through. Safety and stability, as well as the ongoing need to expand electricity access in rural regions remain paramount. As we turn to the provincial level in Yunnan we will see these issues re- appear but with important local challenges to the process of reform and the pursuit of decarbonization."
29,Reform and renewables in China: The architecture of Yunnan's hydropower dominated electricity market,"Reforms currently under way in China's electricity markets bear important implications for its decarbonization objectives. The southwestern province of Yunnan is among the provinces piloting the current iteration of power market reforms. As such, lessons from Yunnan will inform future market reform and renewable energy policies in China and potentially elsewhere. The dominance of hydropower in Yunnan's energy portfolio and the particular transmission constraints it faces, offer an interesting case study of the challenges of decarbonization. We report on market architecture reforms and aggregate market data collected from the Yunnan Power Exchange. We review four elements in the reformed market architecture. Market pricing rules, transitional quantity controls, the generation rights market, and inter-provincial trade. The specifics of market reform reflect a compromise between decarbonization, inter-provincial competition, grid security and development objectives and contribute to understanding of how the dual transitions of hydropower decarbonization and market liberalization interact. We conclude on six insights regarding the role of the grid operator, security checks on trade, integration of cascade hydropower, the inclusion of renewables in the generation rights market, price controls, and market participant price uncertainty.","4. Yunnan's hydropower dominated electricity
4.1. Yunnan's electricity fundamentals
Yunnan's electricity market is dominated by large hydropower ca- pacity and falling provincial consumption leading to falling hydro- power utilization rates. Market reforms seek to promote hydropower consumption through the introduction of a pricing mechanism, quantity controls and tradable generation rights, as well as market-based inter- provincial trade.
Yunnan has a population of 47.4 million and is located in south- western China sharing international borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar [55]. The altitude difference between the highest point in Yunnan and the lowest is more than 6000 m and average annual pre- cipitation is more than 1100mm. The Jinsha River (upper Yangtze River), Lancang River (upper Mekong River), Nu River (upper Salween River) are the main rivers flowing through Yunnan, providing massive hydropower resources which are typically developed in a mix of large and small hydropower facilities cascaded along these and other rivers [16].
Yunnan's annual power consumption in 2015 was 143.8 TWh and generation was 255.3 TWh, with an average annual generation capacity growth rate of 25.5% reaching 61 GW by the end of 2016. Hydropower accounted for 73% of Yunnan's total capacity and 81% of annual gen- eration (another 15% of generation comes from thermal) [56]. The remainder comes from wind and other renewables. If all 61 GW were running throughout the year, only 42% of hydropower capacity would be required to meet Yunnan's annual consumption. Overcapacity can also be seen in the fact that cumulative installed generation capacity in Yunnan accounts for 5.3% of the national total, while the gross power consumption accounts for just 2.8% of the national total [9]. The rapid development of hydropower has meant that oversupply is increasingly a problem. In rainy years and even in some years with average rainfall, provincial demand can be met by hydropower alone.
Fig. 1 shows aggregated data from the YNPX in its first year of trading (2015) where ‘market supply’ refers to the quantity suppliers offered on the market, ‘market demand’ refers to buyer bids, and ‘market cleared’ refers the quantity actually traded on the market. We show market data as compared to the quantities mandated under planned generation (‘non-market’). Clearly, supply is substantially larger than market demand throughout the year. During the summer months, market supply substantially outstrips even the quantities of planned generation.
Oversupply is further exacerbated due to low economic growth in Yunnan. Compared with the fast development of power supply, elec- tricity demand growth in the province has been slower than expected. Annual growth in power consumption peaked at 19.92% in 2011, but in 2015 was at − 9%. Low growth in electricity consumption is largely due to lower than expected GDP growth which at 8%, was substantially lower than the projected 11% [9]. Large consumers in Yunnan are mainly energy-intensive companies, such as electrolytic aluminum, yellow phosphorus and ferroalloy producers. The NDRC set retail prices relatively high for some of these producers and consequently some have reduced production. The fact that market prices can be lower and would thereby spur industrial growth is among the motivating factors for the Yunnan government and grid to pursue market reform.
Power consumption in Yunnan's 16 prefectures is depicted in Fig. 2 with the 5 prefectures that did not participate in the market having their values shown in grey. It should be noted that Yunnan itself has a fragmented power grid where some prefectures have semi-autonomous grids, relying on small scale hydropower for electrification [20,58]. Baoshan (BS) is isolated from the YNPG and did not participate in the market. Since we use aggregated data from the Yunnan Power Ex- change (YNPX), we cannot distinguish between producers by size, however voltage criteria (Section 4.2), mean it is unlikely any small scale hydropower participated in the market. Other non-participating prefectures were Dehong (DH), Nujiang (NJ), Diqing (DQ), which are all autonomous prefectures, and Lijiang (LJ).
Levels and type of industrialization are different in each prefecture, so the market has different effects on consumption in each. Puer (PE) and Banna (BN) showed an annual electricity consumption growth rate of over 5%, mainly because they are not highly industrialized and further development is driving consumption growth. In Lincang (LC) and Chuxiong (CX), the annual growth rate was also positive. Negative annual electricity consumption growth rates were observed in Wenshan (WS), Qujing (QJ), Honghe (HH), Dali (DL) and the provincial capital Kunming (KM). Yuxi (YX) and Zhaotong (ZT) had annual growth rates lower than − 10%. Overall, larger prefectures all saw a contraction and only the smaller prefectures saw rising electricity consumption. Concern about a slowing Chinese economy and a contraction in demand for industrial outputs meant lower market prices did not offset the re- duction in Yunnan's producers’ electricity consumption.
Thermal power is nearer provincial load centers than hydropower and plays an important role in stable operation of the power grid. In the dry season, thermal power is still important as a guaranteed supplier and its continued operation remains an objective like elsewhere [60]. However, with hydropower oversupply, utilization of thermal capacity has dropped and thermal generators are losing the revenue needed to finance their role in peaking and the dry season.
Due to the over-supply of hydropower and the lack of demand,
many hydropower stations are having to release water without gen- erating electricity, which is known as “spilling” [13,55]. Two way to mitigate this problem are: 1) the further development of market me- chanisms to encourage more efficient use of these resources, 2) the further development of the inter-provincial transmission network in order for some of this over-supply to be sold to eastern load centers such as Guangdong, Zhejiang or others, as part of the West to East Electricity Transfer Project.
4.2. Market architecture
Yunnan's electricity market opened for trading on the 1st of January 2015. The Yunnan government stated that the market promotes mutual development, energy security, market-pricing and social stability [57,61]. Yunnan's electricity market is a monthly market with no real- time balancing market, no ancillary services or reserves market but a market in generation rights (comparable to a capacity market) has been established.
The market architecture was designated the 3–1-3–4 System (see Fig. 3). This designation stands for the fact there are 3 types of parti- cipants, 1 power exchange, 3 markets, and 4 trading mechanisms. In addition to buyers and sellers, the YNPG participates by operating the grid and performing security checks on market transactions. The three markets are provincial, inter-provincial, and generation rights markets. The 4 mechanisms are: bilateral trading, pool-based trading, listing, and finally, government determination.
Market participation does not extend to all producers and con- sumers. Only industrial consumers who meet national industrial, en- ergy efficiency, and emission reduction requirements can buy elec- tricity in the market from generators. Sellers are limited to only thermal plants with a voltage of 220 kV or above and hydropower plants of 220 kV or above who opened after 2004. This means that typically only large generators are allowed to participate in the market. This also means that, not all of the cascaded hydropower along a river will be eligible to participate in the market. All other generators and consumers must still sell to and buy from the Yunnan Power Grid (YNPG) at NDRC prices. These participation conditions mean that our data do not dis- tinguish between generators or consumers by location, state or private ownership, or any criteria other than the eligibility criteria.
Fig. 4 depicts the stages of trading, showing how each is subject to a security check. The YNPG performs this to account for line congestion on both buyer and seller side, interconnections among cascade hydro- power, and the risk of spillage. The results of the security check are returned to YNPX in the form of generation quantity caps which YNPX applies as constraints to another round of bid clearing. The security check is based on technical requirements, not market factors such as cost or price. For example, if a transmission line is congested, genera- tion is curtailed according to capacity. This means the grid retains substantial control over generation.
One of the reasons that cascade coupling remains part of the se- curity check, is an issue of market power under supply dominated by cascade hydropower. Most of Yunnan's electricity is generated in such systems where multiple dams are built along one river [16]. The hy- draulic couplings between plants mean that the output of upstream generation affects the feasible generation downstream. Release strate- gies upstream are commercial secrets but downstream schedules cannot be made without this information. Efficient performance of the entire cascade is likely only possible if generation is integrated under one operator [62]. Problems of competition along a cascade create in- centives for anti-competitive behavior and alongside security of supply issues meant the grid and authorities preferred to remain under a re- latively stringent security check [38,42].
4.3. Prices in the trading pool and listing
Electricity trading happens in at least two sequential stages which are conducted in order to ensure that all demand is cleared. The effect of this policy on the bidding strategies of buyers and sellers is unclear, particularly given the various trading systems used in successive stages and uncertainties induced by the pricing mechanism. Before trading on the structured markets, participants are free to submit contracts agreed in direct negotiations between the buyer and seller. While direct con- tracting provides the opportunity to reduce uncertainty, participants may be discouraged from doing so by the fact that better prices may be available in the subsequent structured stages of trading.
The first structured trading mechanism is a trading pool where buyers bid a quantity and a price-cut to their NDRC prices (the bid price equals the NDRC price minus the price-cut). Meanwhile, sellers bid a quantity and a price-cut from their NDRC price. Bid prices are then adjusted by line loss and transmission charges to give effective bid prices. Buyers and sellers are then sorted by the difference of prices (DOP) and paired if their price difference is not negative. Buyers are awarded contracts with a unit price of their bid price minus half their DOP. This means buyers get a cheaper effective price than they bid for and sellers get a higher effective price (see Appendix A for a more detail on the pricing mechanism).
The second structured stage is the listing of demand remaining from the trading pool where differences between the remaining buyers and seller bids were negative. Now, sellers offer another bid with a new quantity but the same price-cut as before. Buyers select from these bids which although above the buyer bid, are below NDRC prices. If multiple buyers select the same listing, their demanded quantity is divided be- tween the suppliers pro-rata. Another round of security checks and constrained bid clearing follows in the same manner as in the trading pool.
Fig. 5 shows the difference between average NDRC prices and average market prices for Yunnan consumers in 2015. The difference was highest in April and May. From June to October, reservoirs must lower their water levels for flood prevention in the wet season by re- leasing water for generation or spilling, meaning large price-cuts in the pre-flood season.
In June 2015, YNPX implemented the Bidding Price Floor Program which set a price floor at 0.15RMB/kWh making any supply bids below this price void. It was lowered to 0.1 RMB/kWh in 2016, then raised again to 0.13 RMB/kWh in 2017 [57,63,64]. Usually, there are at least minor differences in price between generator bids. However, in the wet season, the price floor becomes binding and many seller bids fall to the same price so rules governing how equally priced bids are allocated between buyers become more important. In Yunnan, rationing is done by dividing the quantity demanded among generators proportionally to the quantities in the generators’ bids [57]. In combination, the price floor and pro-rata rationing guarantee that producers will receive at least some contracts and that none is left without revenue. Note that the average price in Fig. 5 will still be above the price floor as some con- tracts will still be made above the price floor.
4.4. Transitional quantity controls
As with earlier trials, not all electricity generated or demanded was opened for market trade. In 2015, only 30% of a baseline quantity could be exchanged on the market. This restriction was called the “Ex-ante Obligatory-use Electricity Contract” (EOEC). It was reduced from 70% of the market participant's quantity to 50% in 2016 and was entirely removed in 2017. The EOEC allows a gradual relaxation of controls, smooth transition away from pre-existing contracts and ameliorates concerns over market power where participants with large market shares use this to skew market outcomes in their favor.
Buyers’ EOECs were set equal to their consumption in April 2014. This was considered a reasonable minimum market share since NDRC prices are high during the dry season and consumption is generally lower. For sellers, annual EOECs were determined using the following equation: Where QObli,i represents the annual EOEC for plant i, Qtsd represents total predicted regulated demand as determined by YNPX (these are mostly public services such as hospitals, water supply, etc.). Qrpg represents total generation by plants still regulated and not in the market, Qpmd represents market demand as predicted by YNPX and Capai represents nameplate capacity of plant i.
These annual EOECs were then allocated by month. Hydropower plants’ annual EOECs were allocated according to the monthly gen- eration capacity according to YNPG power system schedule optimiza- tion. The allocation of thermal plants’ annual EOECs across months was based on two criteria: (1) In the flood season, absorb hydropower as much as possible and use thermal capacity for power grid stability. (2) The remaining EOEC was then allocated across other seasons according to thermal plants’ installed capacity.
Buyer EOECs guarantee minimum market share for buyers. This can be important for small and medium sized companies which could not deter efforts by larger competitors to push up prices. For sellers, EOECs have a symmetric effect. The preponderance of hydropower creates a particular problem of market power. Hydropower has extremely low marginal costs, particularly in the summer and is able to drive out thermal capacity which is required to meet demand in the dry season [65,66]. EOECs therefore helped guarantee thermal generators’ revenue for the first few years of reform.
57 generators and 7042 consumers were eligible to participate in the market but not all did. The number of sellers and buyers trading in 2015 are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 with ‘cleared’ indicating the number of buyers and sellers who have had their bids successfully converted to contracts and were not left without a transaction. As for market buyers, only about 12% of qualified buyers bid in the market. This is potentially due to the fact that many buyers have experienced a downturn in ac- tivity and so their demand is below their EOEC. As shown in Fig. 7, almost all demand was cleared. One reason for the outstanding demand is that as buyers do not know their counterparty in advance, and hence the costs associated with the trade, they may submit price-cuts that push them below price-floors or competitive rates. This is particularly a problem for some fertilizer producers who already have extremely low NDRC regulated prices. A small share of demand is also unmet due to transmission congestion. Based on solely participant numbers, concerns about market power are much greater on the seller side than on the buyer side as expected.
There are about 45 sellers each month, accounting for nearly 80% of qualified sellers. Sellers not participating in the market are mainly thermal generators who were unable to compete with low marginal costs of hydropower. Based on market data, we calculated the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index of power suppliers at 2125.87, indicating moderate market concentration. The greater problem of market power is the issue of cascade hydropower.
4.5. The market in generation rights
In China, generation rights markets have been trialed before where plants which used up their planned generation could purchase addi- tional generation rights from less efficient plants [21,67]. In Yunnan, the capacity market was set up to reduce emissions cost effectively and provide thermal capacity remuneration. Thermal generators can sell their generation rights to hydropower generators and accrue revenue without emitting pollution. Thermal generators could only sell to hy- dropower and hydropower can only trade amongst itself.
A measure called the Minimum Trade Quantity (MTQ) was also used. MTQ's were set for each thermal plant by YNPX and these gen- erators were then obliged to trade this quantity in the capacity market. Given all generators have EOEC's, MTQ's were taken out of these. A three-phase trade mechanism was used to guarantee fulfilment of each plant's MTQ, as shown in Fig. 4.
First, thermal plants and hydro plants are free to negotiate the trading quantity and price and submit results to the YNPX. After the security check, generation rights are exchanged. The second-phase is listing of remaining MTQs or other generation rights supplied. Hydropower plants which have idle capacity can choose to buy these and contracts are allocated by buyer's quantity bids pro rata.
The final stage comes through a determination by the Yunnan government if a thermal plant's traded rights remain below its MTQ. Its generation is divided into different blocks with different selling prices derived from the markets based on its prices across different buyers and its NDRC determined prices. Thermal capacity blocks are sorted in as- cending price order and rights are sold to hydropower generators until its MTQ is fulfilled. Although the MTQ was only in place for 2015, other mechanisms still exist by which generators are obliged to trade.
Traded generation rights for each month in 2015 are shown in Fig. 8. In total, about 6.483 TWh of capacity was traded between hy- dropower and thermal power. With an average selling price of 0.17RMB/kWh for generation rights, this market brought in 1.1 billion RMBs (about 117 million US dollars) in revenue for thermal power without any coal being fired and contributed to a reducing Yunnan's carbon intensity and local air-pollution. It also reduced the amount of spilled hydropower and gave thermal capacity a source of revenue.
4.6. Inter-provincial trade along the southern route
The West to East Electricity Transfer Project is part of a develop- ment initiative to boost growth of the inland provinces [68]. Given that the Southern Grid is only weakly connected to other regional grids and transmission expansion plans are not in place to change this, Guang- dong will likely remain Yunnan's main customer. In 2008, Yunnan's electricity ranked second cheapest with an average price of 0.24 RMB / kWh while Guangdong ranked most expensive (0.47 RMB / kWh) [51]. Inter-provincial trade then makes both economic and environmental sense as Yunnan's cheap hydropower surplus is exported to Guangdong to both reduce Guangdong's electricity costs and coal consumption. However, as inter-provincial transmission capacity has grown, the quantity traded has not necessarily kept up.
In 2015, Yunnan's interconnection with Guangdong and Guangxi consisted of 20.3 GW high voltage transmission capacity and 10 GW of ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission capacity. Another 5 GW UHV line was completed in November 2017 [69–71], and the total trans- mission capacity will rise to 46 GW by the end of 13th 5-year plan (2020). In 2014, 87.7 TWh were transferred to Guangdong, accounting for nearly 40% of total generation in Yunnan and approximately 16% of Guangdong's consumption. From these values a transmission line uti- lization ratio of approximately 25% can be deduced. This, in addition to the further transmission capacity currently being developed, indicates that transmission capacity may not be the key constraint on inter-pro- vincial trade.
Transmission lines are owned and operated by CSG while inter- provincial trade agreements over quantity and price involve the NDRC, CSG, and the relevant provincial governments [68]. This process seeks to balance the interests of generators, consumers, and transmission. Decision-making authority rests with the NDRC for the final say over prices but it consults with the provincial governments, respective grids and CSG. The NDRC sets CSG transmission charges, the sales price, and the buyers (primarily Guangdong) purchasing price.
Three problems face this trade. 1) While Guangdong's consumers may benefit from lower prices, producers will suffer under increased competition. It is unclear whether growth in GDP due to lower elec- tricity prices and higher subsequent tax revenues would offset losses incurred due to local producers being outcompeted by imports from Yunnan. Additionally, the question of the displaced workforce would also be pertinent. 2) Purchasing prices resulting from the West-East agreements are not always below average Guangdong prices. Given a fixed quantity exported under the agreement, Yunnan's exported elec- tricity does not compete in the market and faces no incentive to drive prices down. Yunnan's sale price has been increasing (at times mark- edly) and could thereby undermine its attractiveness to Guangdong [68]. As Guangdong becomes increasingly dependent on Yunnan's hy- dropower, concerns may arise about Yunnan extracting monopolistic rents from this dependence. 3) Yunnan's agreement fulfilment rate in the dry season was never above 76% during the 11th 5-year plan (2006–2011) [68]. This was driven by insufficient hydropower re- sources in the dry season. This uncertainty imposes an added cost on Guangdong's grid and generators who must compensate idle capacity needed as a backup for the dry season.
While the transmission agreement constitutes the largest share of inter-provincial trade, an additional quantity is traded in an inter-pro- vincial market. Trade in the inter-provincial market uses listing. Demand in the inter-provincial market comes from Guangdong's elec- tricity import demand beyond the transmission agreement. The only difference between inter-provincial trade and Yunnan's internal market is the determination of prices. The price-cut from NDRC prices used here is determined by negotiation between provincial governments, not by market participants.
Fig. 9 shows that about 6.223 TWh were sold to Guangdong in 2015 on the YNPX as opposed to as part of the inter-provincial agreement. This amounts to 8.51% of total transfer. This electricity would not have been transferred without the inter-provincial market and would likely have been spilled. At an average selling price of 0.25RMB/kWh, the inter-provincial market generated 1.52 billion RMBs (about 245 million USD) of revenue for generators in Yunnan. While market-based inter- provincial trade may offer environmental and economic benefits, the question of mutual trust and competition between the provinces make attaining the more difficult.
5. Areas for further reform
As Yunnan reforms its electricity sector, the central issue is the balance that must be struck between the conflicting interests of grid stability, continued thermal generation, the promotion of competition, and the reduction in renewable energy spillage. Earlier trials stalled under similar strains and it remains to be seen how further liberal- ization unfolds from this still strictly controlled market. The previous section reviewed how different aspects of market design were being adjusted to meet multiple objectives of reform and decarbonization. Pricing and trading stages drive demand, price floors guarantee rev- enue, quantity controls deal with stranded thermal assets and market power, and interregional trade improves hydropower utilization rates.
Even as Yunnan's market and others in China may not be aiming to achieve the same liberal market design, the ‘textbook architecture’ discussed initially provides a useful benchmark against which to com- pare Yunnan's reforms. Document 9 clearly stated that the government will retain asset ownership and that inter-regional trade will develop at the guidance of provincial governments. These aspects of market ar- chitecture, although diverging from the ‘textbook architecture’, will not be developed further here. Important remaining issues and potential reforms identified for which Document 9 left a space are the following:
• Review the role of the grid operator
• Review conditions of security checks
• Integrate cascade hydropower and use long-term contracting • Give distributed renewables tradeable generation rights • Promote inter-provincial trade in generation rights
• Price controls and stranded assets
• Reduce transaction costs by reducing price uncertainty due to DOP
and other charges
5.1. Grid operator controls
From literature and as well as the history of China's reforms, it is clear that the ability of the grid operator to exercise market power through control over transmission is a potential barrier to reform. Under current reforms, grid operators retain key responsibilities in- cluding: owning the exchange, introducing price floors, administering security checks, determining the EOECs and MTQ's, as well as pro- vincial and inter-provincial transmission. Demand response measures are also a grid responsibility which creates a conflict of interest and should be unbundled but Document 9 does not envisage this happening [48,72].
The EOEC and capacity market have allowed for some of these is- sues to be dealt with gradually and supporting an orderly transition for both liberalization and renewables deployment. Strict controls during reform came through the EOEC, MTQs and the security check. The EOECs were reduced over the course of the two years and have now been abolished. The security check however remains in place and will do so for the foreseeable future. Grid operators remain indispensable partners in transitions to renewables and market reform. Policy for- mulation must maintain a close relationship with the grid but move to give generators independence where feasible. Cascade hydropower dominance creates a potentially serious barrier to competition.
5.2. Review security checks
One way to further liberalize Yunnan's electricity market is by re- viewing the grid's security checks. In particular, the role of security checks in managing cascade hydropower and transmission congestion. Congestion management is based on generator capacity rather than price. This problem is acute for small hydropower with low capacity often connected to smaller branches of the network with lower voltage and transmission capacity. Algorithms for curtailing production under conditions of line congestion could cut more expensive generators first. These algorithms could be reviewed by the NDRC and the SERC but remain under control of the grid in order to find a feasible transition pathway towards more efficient market solutions while still pursuing grid expansion, stability and renewables dispatch. A market in trans- mission rights is an alternative although this has been shown to po- tentially offer greater incentive for market participants with market power to manipulate markets in order to capture the scarcity rents created by a congested transmission line [64].
5.3. Cascade hydropower
In Yunnan, the preponderance of cascade hydropower systems adds a layer of complexity for power planning and grid operation hydraulic coupling is part of the security check. This can result in inefficient curtailment or allocation of water between hydropower plants. Market- oriented approaches should leave release decisions to generators and use capacity or generation rights markets to guarantee supply to the grid. Integrating along cascades and leaving operation of these to a single operator would encourage optimal release policies. It is likely that such integrated cascades would dominate the market and the issue of their market power then becomes pertinent. Such market power can be mitigated through the procurement of their services through regu- lated forward contracts as these reduce their incentive to manipulate the associated electricity markets [42,66]. These contracts would be concluded outside a month-by-month market, but could be im- plemented through the direct negotiation stage in the current trading system. Longer term contracting also has potential benefits in coordinating thermal and renewable generation [60]. The clearest way to discourage market manipulating activities by cascade operators would be to interconnect their electric grid more closely with the wider southern grid where even a large cascade cannot affect prices. This again raises the issue of inter-provincial trade.
5.4. Tradeable generation right for renewables
Yunnan reduced emissions by approximately 5.58 million tons of CO2 through the establishment of the generation rights market with hydropower buying thermal generation rights. Tradable generation rights for distributed renewables could mitigate the problem of inter- mittency while further reducing emissions. Intermittent generators could buy generation rights when unable to meet contracts. This however requires a day-ahead market where distributed renewables already have a high degree of certainty over generation.
Priority purchase rules for renewables have been introduced under the Renewables legislation which means grid operators look to dispatch distributed renewables as much as possible. While protected by priority rules, renewables generators bear none of the risk associated with in- termittency and enjoy relatively high NDRC prices. Without that risk, renewables generators have no reason to bid in the generation rights market.
5.5. Inter-provincial trade in generation rights
In 2015 and 2016, Guangdong demand for Yunnan electricity was traded in the listing market but not in 2017. Potential benefits of inter- provincial trade are hindered by mutual dependence and issues around stranded assets. Some of these issues could potentially be dealt with if a common capacity market or generation rights market existed. If Yunnan hydropower generators could purchase generation rights from Guangdong generators it would open the possibility for mutual benefit as well as further reductions in CO2 intensity while ameliorating con- cerns about security of supply and stranded assets. Such a market could help to raise the agreement fulfilment rates for Yunnan generators during the dry season and provide Guangdong generators with an ad- ditional source of revenue. Thermal generators in Guangdong would have the incentive of winning expensive Guangdong contracts and purchasing cheap Yunnan capacity to meet these. This would however also require allowing hydropower to buy thermal generation rights, which was not allowed previously.
Issues around potential abuse of market power in these markets would have to be explored. These could likely be dealt with by a system of supervision and monitoring shared between the governments in- volved in the Southern Grid. Each would have an interest in checking the other's participants and could refer cases to the NDRC or SERC for arbitration.
5.6. Price controls and stranded assets
In the wet season, as hydropower generators spill more, prices are cut further and the floor becomes binding. In combination with pro-rata rationing the price floor guarantees each producer receives at least some contracts and none is without revenue. A ‘textbook architecture’ would not support price floors arguing that while it supports existing capacity it incentivizes further development and contributes to over- supply [38]. Removing price floors on bidding would continue to sink prices to marginal costs and producers with higher marginal costs would likely be pushed out of the market. This would signal the need to stop further capacity expansion and would reward energy storage technologies. Hydropower generators have extremely low marginal costs in the wet season and would potentially even accept negative prices to reduce spillage. Some existing capacity would then no longer be profitable and may end up stranded. Most likely the price floor will remain as maintaining spills and overcapacity is less disruptive than incurring the social cost of displaced workforce and liquidation of stranded assets.
5.7. Reduce price uncertainty
It is unclear what effect the pricing mechanism has on the bidding strategies employed. Part of the reason for this is that the associated costs of a transaction are not clear to the participants in advance. Some effective bids fell below the price floor because of uncertainty as to the costs driving effective bidding price. The determination of bids must take into account several uncertainties: who will be the counter-party; what are their NDRC prices, transmission and other charges; what will be their price-cut; in which stage of trading is the best deal available. Further research is required to determine the optimal bidding strategy in this context and what the aggregate outcomes of these strategies will be. Likely these uncertainties create transaction costs making trade less attractive and outcomes less efficient. The pricing system should be simplified to reduce these uncertainties to for example, a simple unit charge adjusted periodically and tailored to the participants specific charges.
6. Conclusion
Yunnan's oversupply of hydropower and weak local demand moti- vate market reforms while the need for coordination of cascade hy- dropower and grid stability constrains market operation under the se- curity check. Market prices are beneficial for Yunnan consumers as they can fall below NDRC prices and the pricing and market architecture are designed to boost demand. Quantity controls and the generation rights market allowed for a smoother transition from plan and existing con- tracts to a market trade. Generation rights and interprovincial market trade also contributed substantially to reducing emissions and reducing renewable energy wastage. Each of these areas could be further re- formed to harness market efficiencies but is often challenged by in- stitutional barriers and other risks.
The grid is best placed to understand the requirements of reliable electricity supply and is again at the forefront of both liberalization and decarbonization. Future reforms should explore how to further relax the control the grid exerts over generators. In particular, the content of the security check should be reviewed. The issue of hydropower dominance plagued earlier trials and remains an issue in Yunnan as it means the security check must be more intrusive. The use of long-term contracts with integrated cascades may be more appropriate if sufficient inter- provincial market integration cannot be achieved to enable effective competition.
In Yunnan, as elsewhere, technological transition is mediated by technical and social conditions. Local interests shape both technology choices and choices over institutional arrangements. In turn, these in- stitutions affect technology deployment and utilization. Market-or- iented policy instruments exist for managing the risks to grid stability and security of supply, but liberalization requires relinquishing control and accepting the volatility of market dynamics. The potential costs are not negligible and strong commitment is required to bear these. Document 9 stated neither rapid liberalization nor re-centralization are on the menu. The preferred route entails a gradual transition to market- based resource allocation and a redoubled commitment to renewables deployment.

30,Regional power system modeling for evaluating renewable energy development and CO2 emissions reduction in China,"This study demonstrates how a regional power system modeling tool could be applied to evaluate renewable energy development and emissions reduction with technology change and market reform. We introduce a capacity expansion and operation model with provincial details for China's power system – the Renewable Electricity Planning and Operation (REPO) Model. We compare the spatial and temporal variation of renewable energy development under three alternative scenarios that depict three potentially important technology and reform directions – flexible district heating technology, ultra-high voltage transmission technology and complete spot market to the reference scenario. Under the reference scenario, the share of non-hydro renewable energy in China's power sector will reach 11.3% and carbon emissions of the power sector will increase to 5.1 billion metric tons in 2050. With assumptions made in the flexible district heating technology, ultra-high voltage transmission technology and complete spot market scenario, the share of non-hydro renewable energy in the power sector could increase to 14.3%, 11.5%, and 23.7%, and carbon emissions of power sector will change by −0.3, +0.0, and −1.0 billion metric tons in 2050, respectively. Similar analyses could be extended to other developing countries that plan to deregulate and decarbonize their power systems.","1. Introduction
Power systems in many developing countries face challenges of deregulation and decarbonization. These challenges become more ur- gent when considering the expansion of renewable energy, because existing regulated power systems in most developing countries could limit the integration of large-scale renewable energy. This problem has emerged in some developing countries, for example China, and sig- nificant amount of wind generation has to be curtailed.
China's installed capacity of non-hydro renewable electricity has experienced a remarkable growth since the Renewable Energy Law came into force in 2006, reaching 237 GW by the end of 2016 (China Electricity Council, 2017). With the rapid development, however, cur- tailment has emerged as a major obstacle for further penetration of the renewable power generation into the grid. In 2016, the annual curtailed wind power reached 49.7 TWh, meaning that 20.6% of wind power generation was wasted (National Energy Administration, 2017).
Both technical and market constraints contribute to the curtailment problem. On the technology side, for example, inflexibility of the combined heat and power (CHP) plants in the winter and lack of inter-provincial transmission capacity, are among the most critical issues (Chen et al., 2015); on the market side, the existing power system op- erating rules are unable to integrate large-scale renewable energy as the spot market is essentially missing in China. These challenges have motivated studies that evaluate effects of potential changes in these constraints on the development of renewable energy (Chineke and Ezike, 2010; Lund et al., 2012; Lund et al., 2010; Moreno et al., 2012). To address this problem, future technology changes and market reform are evaluated, prompting quantitative analysis of different possible scenarios.
Existing analyses mostly utilize detailed regional power system modeling tools that integrate long-term expansion and short-term op- eration of the power system. Most of these influential modeling tools are tailored for developed countries. For example, ReEDS, a multi-re- gional power system optimization model, is developed by the US Department of Energy, with detailed technical representation for gen- eration, storage, and transmission of the power system and could ex- press the volatility and uncertainty of wind and solar resources. It has been widely used to study optimal power generation and transmission capacity expansion pathways under different policy and technology scenarios (Short et al., 2009; Short et al., 2011; Bird et al., 2011; Eurek et al., 2016). SWITCH is an open source power system planning model developed by the University of California at Berkeley, and it has been applied for multiple case studies in California (Fripp, 2008, 2012; Johnston et al., 2013; Mileva et al., 2013). The E2M2 model (European Electricity Market Model) is developed by the Organization for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that features stochastic optimization for the operation of European electricity market, and it has been applied to assess long-term changes in electricity prices and carbon prices in high-share renewable electricity scenarios in Europe (Spiecker and Weber, 2014). The Balmorel model is developed by various organizations in Nordic countries (Ravn et al., 2001), and it has been used to evaluate environmental policies and simulate power market in Denmark, Nordic countries, and Europe (Bach et al., 2016; Karlsson and Meibom, 2008; Kirkerud et al., 2017; Kiviluoma and Meibom, 2010).
Detailed power system modeling tools for developing countries are much more scarce. For the case of China, most models are built for theoretical analysis and do not integrate capacity expansion and system operation or disaggregate provincial supply and demand details in a consistent framework based on empirical data of demand profile, re- newable energy resources potential, and transmission capacity. For example, Zhang et al. (2013) analyze the impact of carbon taxes on the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in China by constructing a single-region model. Wang et al. (2014) establish an optimization investment model for China's sub-district power sector to analyze the long-term distribution of air pollutants emitted by thermal power generation. Chen et al. (2014) use an optimization model to study the synergies of wind power and the electrified space heating in Beijing. Zhang et al. (2016) use the grid expansion model to study the role of demand-side responses in promoting the integration of wind power. Chen et al. (2018a) use a mixed integer linear optimization model to study the integrated power and heat systems for higher wind penetration in Jing-Jin-Tang area. Chen et al. (2018b) build an in- tegrated energy optimization model to study the impacts of fleet types and charging modes for electric vehicles on emissions in Beijing. The SWITCH-China model developed by He et al. (2016) is another example of comprehensive modeling tool for China's power system, however, it has not incorporated detailed demand profile and renewable resource data at the provincial level.
In this study, we aim to fill this gap by constructing a new pro- vincial-level power system model — the Renewable Electricity Planning and Operation (REPO) Model. Thanks to its advantageous features and comprehensive database, we are able to quantitatively analyze some key technology and policy factors that potentially affect China's future renewable energy development, including flexible district heating technology, ultra-high voltage transmission technology, and complete spot market. We compare the generation mix, capacity installation and carbon emissions between a reference scenario and three alternative scenarios.
The remaining parts of this paper proceed as follows. Section 2 presents the REPO modeling framework, and Section 3 presents as- sumptions and inputs of scenario design. Main research results are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and provides policy implications and possible extension of the analysis in other de- veloping countries.
2. Modeling framework
Fig. 1 shows the framework of the Renewable Electricity Planning and Operation (REPO) Model, a multi-period capacity expansion and dispatch model that includes provincial details for China. The REPO model extends the open-source Balmorel model developed by various organizations in the countries around the Baltic Sea and features im- portant technology and policy characteristics in China (Ravn et al., 2001). The time and spatial resolution is presented in Appendix Section 1.1. The model uses 2012 as the base year, iterates first to 2015, and then iterates to 2050 with a step of five years. Within one year, we select 12 out of 52 weeks as representative seasons (denoted by S) and 6 h of a typical day in each week as representative time slots (denoted by T). These 72 representative hours (S,T) of a year are simulated for each grid area and each time period. The model covers 32 grid areas that represent all China's provincial-level administrative regions, except Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan (Inner Mongolia is disaggregated to East and West Inner Mongolia). A large number of generation and transmission technologies are represented in the model, with detailed information described in Appendix Section 1.2. In the following sec- tions, we aggregate these technologies by their generation sources and present the results by coal, natural gas, nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind, and solar.
We present the objective function and constraints in Appendix Section 2. We first list key symbols and description in Appendix Section 2.1. The objective function is described in Appendix Section 2.2. The objective function aims to minimize discounted total cost of the power system, which includes power and CHP plants investment cost, opera- tion and maintenance cost, fuel cost, unit commitment cost, transmis- sion cost, and total policy subsidy in each simulation period. In Appendix Section 2.3, we explain three groups of constraints: electricity (and heat) balance constraints, renewable energy resource constraints, and transmission and storage constraints. We highlight a group of constraints related to plants startup/shutdown and ramping in Appendix Section 2.4. These constraints function as a simplified unit commitment module that represents important limitations of thermal power units. We further introduce another group of constraints that represent the current operating rules of China's power system, including minimum annual generation hours and day-ahead generation dispatch.
We describe key data and assumptions that are important inputs of the model in Appendix Section 3. These inputs include aggregated electricity demand, load and renewable electricity supply profile, techno-economic parameters for generation technologies, fuel prices, existing generators and decommission plan, existing transmission ca- pacity, and renewable energy subsidy. We collect these inputs from various sources and integrate them in a consistent way that reflects existing plans and future changes.
3. Assumptions and inputs of scenario design
We describe assumptions made in our reference scenario and three alternative scenarios — flexible district heating technology (FDH), ultra-high voltage transmission technology (UHV) and complete spot market (CSM) in this section. These alternative scenarios are designed mostly for demonstrating the modeling capacity, not for providing exact predictions. Therefore, we only tune one change in each scenario to isolate its impact. In future analysis, we are flexible to introduce some combined changes in one specific scenario, e.g. UHV and CSM, to analysis the combined effects of adding both flexible district heating technology and ultra-high voltage transmission technology in the model. We list key assumptions for different scenarios in Table 1 and refer interested readers to Section 3 of technical appendix for more details about assumptions and input data of the model.
3.1. Reference (REF) scenario
We represent existing non-hydro installation target in China's “13th Five-Year Plan” by 2020 and let the model choose the future installa- tion level in later periods. China's non-hydro renewable power gen- eration enjoys subsidies from the feed-in-tariff, which is composed of the desulfurization benchmark price (local coal-fired unit benchmark price) and renewable energy subsidy (supported by the National Renewable Energy Development Fund). Therefore, we adopt the cur- rent average subsidy price of each renewable power generation technology and assume that the subsidy will gradually phase out by 2035 (Ouyang and Lin, 2014), shown in Appendix Section 3.7. In terms of hydro and nuclear power, the site and capacity of planned devel- opment is generally set by the government. Here we assume the in- stalled capacity of nuclear power reaches 300 GW by 2050, and hy- dropower capacity is 330 GW by 2020 (Wang, 2015; Zhao, 2013).
3.2. Flexible district heating (FDH) scenario
In the flexible district heating scenario, we add heat pump and heat storage technology into the heating system supplied by cogeneration in the model. Since heating demand and high wind power output overlap in the winter of northern China, significant curtailment has to occur to ensure the continuous operation of cogeneration units. The introduc- tion of heat pump and heat storage technology, however, can effec- tively provide additional heating capacity to reduce the demand for heat supply from cogeneration and decrease the renewable curtailment during the heating season, especially in the heat peak hours. In the FDH scenario, the model optimizes the choice of new heat pump and heat storage technology in provinces with heating demand.
3.3. Ultra-high voltage (UHV) scenario
We relax the constraint of inter-provincial power transmission by introducing the ultra-high voltage transmission technology. The cost of the transmission line connecting two provinces is assumed to be only related to its capacity and transmission distance. The length of an inter- provincial transmission line is approximated by the length of train line between the capital city of two provinces. The transmission distance matrix for several selected provinces is shown in Appendix Section 2.2.
In the reference scenario, new transmission capacity is only allowed between geographically adjacent provinces. In the UHV scenario, geo- graphically non-adjacent provinces can be directly connected by new transmission lines. For the transmission distance more than 1000 km, we assume a 20% decline in the fixed investment cost because the UHV line has a significant cost advantage over the 500 kV AC line in the long distance transmission.
3.4. Complete spot market (CSM) scenario
In this scenario, we assume that the electricity market reform will develop a complete spot market and the generation dispatch is near real-time. We relax the day-ahead generation dispatch constraint as well as annual hour utilization constraint, which represent the current operation characteristics of China's power system, shown in Appendix Section 2.5. We are fully aware that this assumption could be very optimistic considering the progress of China's ongoing power system reform, however, we believe it would be interesting to explore the ef- fects of this single important change on the deployment of renewable generation technologies. 4. Results and discussion
We present key results from the model on CO2 emissions of power sector, share of renewable electricity, and share of non-hydro renew- able electricity of all the scenarios by year in Table 2. We juxtapose the generation mix and emissions of all the scenarios by year in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. In each subsection below, we show more detailed out- puts of the model to further explain how each alternative scenario could alter China's future power system.
4.1. Flexible district heating (FDH) scenario
In the FDH scenario, the use of heat pump and heat storage could supply heat alongside cogeneration. As shown in the first and second column for each period of Fig. 2, compared to the REF scenario, wind and solar power generation grow significantly. By 2050, wind and solar power generation increases by 53% and 6%, reaching 1482 TWh and 121 TWh, respectively. The share of coal-fired power decreases slightly to 52.7% in 2050, a 2% decline compared to the REF scenario.
Wind power has kept a continuous growth trend, indicating that it will be competitive even after the subsidy gradually phases out. The increased generation under the FDH scenario suggests that flexible district heating technology is particularly effective to address the wind curtailment problem. Solar power does not increase significantly and remains at a relatively constant level without subsidy.
Therefore, in Fig. 3, carbon emissions in the FDH scenario reduce by 340 million tons in 2050, a 7% decrease compared with the REF sce- nario. Although in theory, adopting heat pump units to replace co- generation units to generate heat could increase emissions due to the lower overall heat supply efficiency of the heat pump, the improved condition for the wind integration with the heat pump makes it possible to reduce emissions by reducing the coal use in both electricity and heat generation.
In the first and second column for each period in Fig. 4, we show the power generation mix in 2050 by province. Compared to the results of the REF scenario in 2050, the coal-fired power generation in some provinces is significantly lower in the FDH scenario, especially for provinces that have high demand for heat in the winter, e.g. Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Shandong. However, the coal-fired power gen- eration in West Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi has a significant increase. This happens because provinces with higher heating demand are less dependent on local cogeneration units, so they could import electricity from provinces with cheap coal prices, such as West Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi. For the same reason, wind power generation increases in provinces that have high demand for heating in winter and also in West Inner Mongolia.
In Fig. 5, we further compare the heat supply mix of all the 72 re- presentative hours in 2050. In the FDH scenario, heat pump and heat storage discharging replace a significant share of CHP to supply heat, causing a significant decline in the heat output of coal-fired cogenera- tion units (shown in grey parts of columns for both scenarios) and in- crease in the heat output from heat pump and storage discharging (shown in orange and green parts of columns for the FDH scenario) during the winter season. Another notable change is that the heat generation is less variant under the FDH scenario because heat storage is able to keep the supply higher in the hours with lower demand. In the UHV scenario, we allow the model to add new inter-pro- vincial transmission lines between non-adjacent provinces. The avail- ability of the UHV technology also decreases the construction cost of transmission lines for provinces with long distance. As shown in the first and third column for each period of Fig. 2, the power generation mix under the UHV scenario does not differ from the result of the REF scenario much. By 2050, the share of non-hydro renewable energy generation is 11.5%, only a 0.2% increase compared to the REF sce- nario. This finding could be counter-intuitive because the UHV tech- nology is usually promoted as a solution to better integrate wind power generation. However, as we have noted earlier, the UHV scenario only additionally allows the non-adjacent inter-provincial transmission and introduces the UHV technology compared to the REF scenario, without including further measures to promote the integration of wind power generation, such as heat pump and heat storage technology, complete spot market, or higher subsidy. Therefore, the UHV technology essen- tially provides chances for both long-distance wind power generation transmission and long-distance coal power generation transmission as there is a huge variation in terms of coal price in China. In aggregate, the UHV scenario delivers a neutral result for the renewable energy development.
In Fig. 3, we show carbon emissions under the REF and UHV sce- nario. It is notable that carbon emissions under the UHV scenario slightly exceed emissions under the REF scenario due to the increased electricity transmission loss in the UHV scenario. To summarize, the supply mix and carbon emissions at the national level under the UHV scenario do not differ from the results under REF scenario much.
At the provincial level, however, the UHV scenario changes the geographical distribution of power generation significantly as shown in Fig. 6. In most provinces, coal power generation decreases, especially in some eastern provinces, e.g. Jiangsu, Guangdong and Fujian, which have high coal prices. The generation is more concentrated in provinces with cheap coal prices, especially in West Inner Mongolia. The generation pattern of wind power also changes significantly with large increase in West Inner Mongolia, which also has rich wind resources. With improved conditions for long-distance transmission, power gen- eration is more concentrated in resource-abundant provinces, making them more important energy bases for China. In the CSM scenario, we assume that the spot market is complete so there is no requirement to formulate annual generation plans (minimum generation hours) for each unit or schedule the dispatch day- ahead. As shown in the first and fourth column for each period of Fig. 2, the share of non-hydro renewable energy generation increases sig- nificantly to 23.7% under the CSM scenario compared to 11.3% under the REF scenario, reaching at the level of 2314 TWh in 2050. The solar generation doubles under the CSM scenario compared to the REF sce- nario, reaching the level of 233 TWh in 2050. Wind and solar genera- tion mostly replace coal power generation, and the share of non-fossil energy in the power sector could reach 57% in 2050.
Carbon emissions under the CSM scenario are therefore significantly lower than that of the REF scenario, shown in Fig. 3. By 2050, carbon emissions under the CSM scenario are about 1 billion tons less than the level under the REF scenario (5.1 billion tons). Additional carbon emissions reduction relative to the share increase of non-hydro re- newable energy comes from the reduced output of low-efficient coal power plants as their minimum annual generation requirement is lifted. After a large scale of decommissioning of thermal power plants, carbon emissions reach a minimum of 3.6 billion tons in 2035 but increase again, although at a lower rate, because China's electricity demand keeps increasing till 2050.
We compare the power generation mix by province in 2050 under the REF and CSM scenario in Fig. 7. Coal power decreases and wind power increases in most provinces under the CSM scenario relative to the REF scenario. In some provinces with rich wind resources, e.g. Hebei, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Yunnan, wind power generation could account for more than 40% of total electricity generation. Similar to the UHV scenario, West Inner Mongolia again sees significant increase in both coal and wind electricity generation, which also indicates that the existing annual minimum generation requirement keeps some more expensive local coal power plants online.
In Fig. 8, we show changes in power generation mix in all the re- presentative hours under the CSM scenario compared to the REF sce- nario. The share of coal power generation decreases while the share of wind and solar increases significantly, especially in the winter heating hours and the summer load peak. In addition, with the abolition of annual minimum generation hours that allows the nuclear power to adjust output and the relaxation of day-ahead scheduling that in- troduces more zero marginal cost renewable power generation making the nuclear power output adjustment more economic, under the CSM scenario, even the nuclear power slightly reduces its output in hours with low demand. In summary, the complete spot market greatly en- hances the flexibility of the power system and introduces more drastic changes in dispatch, generation mix and CO2 emissions.
5. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we introduce the Renewable energy planning and operation (REPO) model and apply the model to assess the impacts of some potentially important technology change and policy reform on the renewable energy development in China. With the rich representation of technology details and operating rules at the provincial level, we are able to analyze changes in China's installed capacity, generation mix, and carbon emissions through 2050 under three alternative scenarios, compared to the reference scenario.
We find that the coal power still maintains a relatively high share (55%) in the total generation in 2050 under the reference scenario with assumptions of renewable subsidy phase-out and no major technology change. The non-hydro renewable energy can only reach 11% under the reference scenario, therefore, carbon emissions could not peak by 2050 either. The flexible district heating technology can improve the in- tegration of wind power during the heating season in northern pro- vinces and increase the share of non-hydro renewable energy to 14%. The UHV technology could greatly change the geographical distribution of power generation, however, it has limited impacts on the generation mix and carbon emissions by itself. Compared to technology changes, an important market reform that constructs a complete spot market will lead to drastic changes. The share of non-hydro renewable generation could reach 24% by 2050 and carbon emissions could drop by 20% in 2050, compared to the reference scenario.
Our findings suggest that a major policy change could create more room for renewable energy electricity compared to some important technology progress, which highlights the importance of China's on- going power market reform on the future renewable energy develop- ment and CO2 emissions reduction. We also show that subsidy or other policy support for renewable energy may still be needed if there is a more ambitious target of CO2 emissions reduction in the power sector.
Some important issues are still remained for the future research. First, we do not report changes in electricity prices and inter-provincial transmission in this paper due to the space limitation although these important topics deserve detailed analysis. Second, other important directions for technology change and policy reform, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), new storage technologies, and carbon pri- cing, could be analyzed. Third, we do not provide detailed sensitivity analyses on various techno-economic parameters of all the technolo- gies. In this paper, we mainly aim to demonstrate the basic structure and application in scenario analyses and leave out the sensitivity test. Last but not least, we could implement scenarios that combine tech- nology change and policy reform so their complementary effects could be quantified.
This modeling exercise provides implications for possible similar analyses for other developing countries. With a detailed regional power system modeling tool, researchers could simulate different directions in future technology and policy changes for a specific region. Our results highlight the importance of power market deregulation on the renew- able energy development and CO2 emissions reduction for a developing country where a complete spot market is usually missing. Without an efficient market, technology transfer and improvement in developing countries could not realize full potential to promote renewable devel- opment and CO2 emissions reduction."
31,Residential electricity consumption after the reform of tiered pricing for household electricity in China,"After almost three years of preparation, the tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) was implemented across China in July 2012. The feedbacks of household electricity consumption to the new pricing policy are investigated in this paper based on the micro household-level data from China’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS). We document that electricity consumption of 82% surveyed households did not affected by the TPHE, which is in conformity with the principle that the TPHE policy based on. More importantly, factors that influence elasticity of household electricity consumption are examined by empirical model in this paper. Results indicate that factors such as the energy price, household income, and demographic attributes have significant impacts on residential electricity consumption. Further discussion outcomes show that the publicity of the TPHE, energy price and some other factors are strongly correlated with the probability that households change the inefficient and lavish pattern of electricity consumption. Future directions for the design and improvement of residential electricity pricing reform are thus suggested.","1. Introduction
Tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE), the abbreviation of household increasing block electricity tariffs (IBTs) in China, divides household electricity consumption into several blocks and charges higher prices for electricity consumption in higher blocks. The theoretical basis for TPHE in economics is Ramsey pricing, that is, the TPHE is based on the residential electricity price elasticity. Implementing the increasing block tariffs for residential electricity is conducive to improving the equity and efficiency, and thereby promoting electricity conservation and energy-related emissions reduction [1,2].
In June 2012, the National Development and Reform Commis- sion (NDRC) in China proposed about implementing the TPHE in July 1st. It demonstrated that the central government determined to initiatively promote energy pricing reform. Under this new pric- ing system, household electricity prices would be set into three tiers based on the volumes of electricity use. In other words, if res- idential electricity consumption exceeded the certain limit (the baseline), it would be charged a higher price.
The guidance issued by the NDRC encompassed two require- ments. First, the reform should ensure that electricity consumption of 80% households would not be affected. Second, the power tariff in the first-tier should remain unchanged, an only the electricity prices in the second tier and the third tier could be increased. The TPHE was then implemented in 29 provinces of China except Tibet and Xinjiang. The local governments were authorized to set up the electricity-price tiers according to the local conditions such as the income level, and temperature. The TPHEs policies of some provinces in China are shown in Table 1.
It is quite common for the general public to question the energy pricing reform in the residential sector, which is closely associated with family lives [3]. Therefore, the reform of residential electricity pricing has become the most sensitive issue in China. The previous residential electricity price, which is lack of transparency and rea- sonability, is administratively depressed by the central government, and thus is lower than its long run marginal cost [4]. Moreover, the uniform electricity pricing mechanism in the residential sector, which mostly benefits the high-income group rather than the low-income residents, goes against the principles of subsidies- improving the access to modern forms of energy and reducing poverty by providing energy subsidies to the poor, has resulted in excessive electricity consumption and inefficient subsidy allocation.
Therefore, it is critical to investigate whether the energy pricing mechanism has achieved the objectives of efficiency and equity. To better understand how the implementation of the TPHE can affect residential electricity consumption, we document several addi- tional questions. First, using the micro household-level survey data, we show some feedbacks of residential electricity consump- tion after the implementation of TPHE. Second, we investigate the elasticities of electricity consumption in different blocks, because factors such as whether the TPHE would be supported by households at different income classes and whether the increas- ing block tariffs have an impact on household electricity consump- tion behavior depend on price elasticities [3]. Finally, we provide the evidence that the publicity of policy, which means making the policy more well-known, does indeed contribute to promoting households to transform from electricity-intensive consumption pattern to electricity-saving consumption pattern. Together, these findings suggest that policy implications are important for decision makers on further promoting the pricing reform of resource prod- ucts in the residential sector [3]. Our findings contribute to the lit- erature in terms of the following aspects. First, they provide answers to the above important questions that are valuable to the further energy pricing reform in China. Second, this paper is based on micro household-level survey data that are more infor- mative and time-efficient, and the determinants of elasticity of household electricity consumption are thoroughly investigated. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents previous literature. Section 3 provides the description of questionnaires and analysis of survey data. Section 4 discusses the empirical results about the elasticity of household electricity consumption. Section 5 further discusses residential electricity consumption after the TPHE reform. Section 6 provides conclusions and policy recommendations.
2. Literature review
Research on the tiered pricing for household electricity mainly focused on two aspects. The first aspect is the public acceptance to the reform. The second aspect is the sensitivity of residents on electricity price changes.
Tiered pricing for household electricity (TPHE) reform is an important tariff policy for household electricity conservation in China. Based on the TPHE, three electricity-price thresholds are proposed, and additional payment will be charged if the household electricity consumption exceeds the upper bound of each thresh- old. The research of how households are sensitive to the reform of residential electricity pricing is crucial, since the general public tends to question the transparency and reasonability of the reform. For example, Wang et al. [3] conducted a questionnaire survey in four urban cities of China, explored determinants of public willing- ness to accept TPHE and made out the acceptable range of premium. Besides, after randomly selecting a sample of 816 resi- dents in Beijing, Wang et al. [5] indicated the discomfort caused by saving in household electricity consumption may has the nega- tive influence on the acceptance of policy. Hensher et al. [6] found that willingness to pay is helpful for establishing desired levels of service quality and requisite service targets through a sample of residents in Canberra, Australia. Erdogdu [7] analyzed the impacts of electricity market reform by panel data of 63 countries during 1982–2009. Without a doubt, the efficiency of the TPHE policy is important for reducing energy consumption. Wang et al. [8] showed that the rebound effect could significantly weaken the effectiveness of policies, and Chinese government should take the rebound effect into consideration when formulating energy poli- cies. Nie and Kemp [9] conducted a decomposition analysis of changes in energy consumption through households’ energy- using activities using data from the China Statistical Yearbook and China Energy Statistical Yearbook in the period 2002–2010. Davoudpour and Ahadi [10] found that if the energy carriers’ price was increased to border price and energy efficiency programs were implemented, they would lower the growth rate of CO2 emissions. Xu and Chen [11] believed that in the electricity reform, China should consummate the tax and levy systems, investment and financial systems and other systems bounded up with the electrical reform, which were regarded as future challenges for the reform.
The sensitivity of electricity price changes, which has substan- tial influence on residential electricity consumption, has recently attracted a lot of attentions. Using the cointegration and error cor- rection model, Athukorala and Wilson [12] and Filippini and Pachauri [13] focused on the evaluation of the price elasticity of power demand. The study of Athukorala and Wilson [12] found that the price elasticity ranged from 0.16 to 0.62 in Sri Lanka during 1960–2007, and Filippini and Pachauri [13] showed that the price elasticity ranged from 0.29 to 0.51 in India. Conduct- ing the panel analysis of the national residential electricity con- sumption, Sun and Lin [4] showed that low-income people were more sensitive to the current tariff, whose price elasticity was about 0.4; while high-income households were less sensitive to the current tariff. A large number of studies have investigated on the price and income elasticities of electricity demand using vari- ous econometric methods, and related literature includes Huq and Dynes [14], Pielow et al. [15], He et al. [16], Dilaver and Hunt [17], Holtedahl and Joutz [18], etc.
A latest similar study by Kavousian et al. [19] proposed a method to examine structural and behavioral determinants of res- idential electricity consumption by developing separate models for daily maximum (peak) and minimum (idle) consumption. Our study concentrates on evaluating the effectiveness of the TPHE in China. Using the micro household-level survey data, three impor- tant issues have been addressed in this paper. First, we investigate the implementations of TPHE and its impact on the household electricity consumption. Second, we investigate determinants of elasticity of household electricity consumption. Third, we provide the evidence that publicity of the policy is conducive to improving the efficiency of residential electricity consumption.
3. Questionnaires and data
3.1. Regional characteristics of surveyed area
The household-level survey data in this paper are collected from China’s Household Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS)1. CRECS is a nationwide survey and covers ten provinces in China, which locate in different areas and have distinct economic development levels. Moreover, the surveyed samples include households in both urban and rural areas, and the surveyed cities are classified as the capital city, the prefecture-level city and the county-level city (see Fig. 1).
Based on the previous studies, residential electricity consump- tion is influenced by not only family attributes but also regional variables such as the local level of electricity price, climate (temperature and precipitation), urban and rural areas, and city- size. The characteristics of surveyed provinces and the description of sampling are presented in Table 2, which shows that large gaps exist among the above regions in terms of electricity consumption expenditure per capita.
3.2. Description of questionnaires
The design of questionnaires is based on the feedbacks from the three-time pre-survey in Xiamen city, Fujian province, China. Surveyed questions are divided into three categories: first, the status quo of household electricity consumption; second, the level of public understanding of the TPHE; third, family attributes. The main questions and their statistical description of CRECS are reported in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that over 72% of surveyed residents have heard about the TPHE, implying that the TPHE has been well publicized and the residential electricity price reform has indeed attracted lots of attention. Besides, the degree of attentions to the national policy varies among households at different income levels and educational levels.
3.3. Residential electricity consumption
Most regions in China follow the instructions of the NDRC and raise similar levels of electricity prices in the second and the third tiers of electricity use. However, the implementations of the TPHE in several cities or regions are based on the local situations. For instance, Penglai city in Shandong province did not implemented the TPHE due to the delayed update of residential electricity meters, and electricity price remain unchanged in the rural area in Jiangsu province. The average monthly electricity costs of 1180 interviewed families were 124.65CNY in January 2013, which was equivalent to 229.07 kW h per month. The distributions of residential electricity consumption in urban and rural areas are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
The current pricing for household electricity in most regions in China is based on the principle that electricity consumption of 80% residents would not be affected. However, results show that elec- tricity consumption of 36.97% surveyed families was in the first tier; electricity consumption of 45.21% surveyed families was in the second tier; and electricity consumption of 17.82% surveyed families was in the third tier (Fig. 4). Price of electricity consump- tion in the second tier is 0.05 CNY higher than that in the first tier. Electricity expenditure of households in the second electricity- price tier increased 3.44 CNY to 10.37 CNY per month. The average monthly electricity costs of households in the third electricity- price tier increased 48.28 CNY to 254.24 CNY.
Therefore, electricity consumption of 82% surveyed households did not affected by the TPHE, implying that electricity expenditure of 82% surveyed households maintained almost unchanged. The average growth rate of household electricity expenditure of elec- tricity consumption in the second tier ranged from 2.25% to 5.20%. In contrast, the average growth rate of household electricity expenditure of electricity consumption in the third tier ranged from 18.04% to 48.48%. It can be seen that electricity expenditure of households in the third electricity-price tier has been signifi- cantly increased. Electricity expenditure change of households in different electricity-price tiers are presented in Table 4.
4. Empirical results
In order to assess the statistical significance of the fact that the elasticity of electricity consumption varies from different blocks, we build the following residential electricity consumption model according to Sun and Lin [4].
Yi 1⁄4a0 þh1 ln price1i þh2 ln price2i þdXi þap þei ð1Þ
where Yi is the logarithm of electricity consumption of the ith household, the p subscript refers to province. The variables of ln price1 and ln price2 denote the prices of electricity and gas. X indicates the control variables (e.g., ln income, area of house denoted by squ or the scale of the households denoted by num and so on). Table 5 shows the main variables listed above, as well as their definitions.
Results of the model (1) are reported in Table 6. We can see that most signs of the coefficients of the variables in the three columns are in line with expectations. Among the variables, the coefficient of electricity price denoted by ln price1 is significantly negative and varies from different blocks. In the first tier sample, the price elasticity of electricity is 0.652 but insignificant, while the coeffi- cients are 0.843 and 1.036 for the second tier and the third tier, respectively. These results imply that holding other variables con- stant, households in the third electricity-price tier are more sensi- tive to electricity price than those in the second electricity-price tier. Any increases in electricity price and expenditure will lead to a higher probability for households to save more electricity for households in the third electricity-price tier. The reason comes from the facts that price of electricity use in the second tier is 0.05 CNY/kW h higher than that in the first tier, which only shows a mild rise of electricity consumption cost; while electricity-price in the third tier is 0.30 CNY/kW h higher than that in the first tier, which denotes a sharp increase and makes the households more sensitive. The coefficient of gas price denoted by ln price2 (the cross elasticity of price) is significantly negative, implying that the increase in the gas price will lead to the higher probability of choosing electricity to replace gas consumption. To a certain extent, offsetting effects exist between the two resource prices, which mainly due to the substitute effect.
The coefficient of the dummy variable of ‘‘the installation of solar water heaters” represented by ifsol is also significantly negative for electricity consumption in the second and third tiers, indicating that households who have installed solar water heaters may have more awareness of energy conservation, and thus will be more sensitive to the TPHE reform and are more likely to adopt electricity-saving behavior. The coefficient of ‘‘scale of households” denoted by num is not significant, implying that the variable is not the major factor that affects household elasticity of electricity consumption. The variable of ifrur equals to 1 if the households are located in the rural area. The empirical result shows that households in rural area con- sume less electricity than those in urban area. Among the variables related to family attributes, the positive coefficient of household income denoted by ln income is in line with our expectation, indicating that there is a positive correlation between electricity consumption and household income level. The coefficient of living area is positively correlated with household electricity consump- tion, because the living area is closely related with the level of household income in country-level cities or rural areas.
In the regression model with full samples, the elasticity has a deviation from the different tiers. Therefore, we further conduct the sample grouping to discuss whether differences exist in sensi- tivity to electricity cost of households in different electricity-price tiers, the following model is estimated. where Itj is the indicator of the household status, and the subscripts of t and j refer to income class and electricity-price tier. For exam- ple, t 1⁄4 1 and j 1⁄4 1 denotes the households have a lower income and are in the first electricity-price tier, and t 1⁄4 3 and t 1⁄4 3 denotes the households have the highest income and are in the third tier of electricity price.
Results of the model (2) are reported in Table 7. The coefficient of the variable of ‘‘electricity price”, which is negative in the elec- tricity consumption model of households and is distinct from 9 windows. The elasticity of households with lower income and in the first electricity-price tier ðt 1⁄4 1; j 1⁄4 1Þ is 0.693, implying that households with lower income in the first electricity-price tier are more sensitive than those in the second and third tiers of electric- ity price. This implies that if the lower income group consumed electricity at the second or the third tier, they will be less sensitive to price change than those in the first tier. This effect is inverse in the third income class. The elasticity of households with the high- est income but in the first tier ðt 1⁄4 3; j 1⁄4 1Þ is 0.708, while those in the second and third tiers are 0.619 and 0.516, respectively. Since the higher income households choose to consume electricity at a lower electricity-price tier, they would be more energy-saving and more sensitive to the electricity price. That’s the reason why elasticity of households with the highest income but in the first tier is higher than those in the second and third tiers. 5. Further discussion Facing the increasing block electricity tariffs, households may be more sensitive to price change and therefore are more likely to sav- ing electricity consciously. If the households maintain their previ- ous inefficient consumption patterns, indicating that they have little sensitiveness to the implementation of TPHE. One of the most important question we would like to take into consideration is that whether publicity of the TPHE helps to eliminate the misunder- standing of ‘‘disguised price increases” and promote households to save more energy. Since some factors listed in Tables 6 and 7 have an impact on elasticity of electricity consumption, we also interested in the problem that whether factors such as power price and the installation of solar water heaters, are correlated with effi- ciency improvement of residential electricity consumption. where Changei is whether households take actions to save electric- ity after the implementation of TPHE? Changei 1⁄4 1 denotes house- holds would change their electricity consumption patterns and consume less electricity and Changei 1⁄4 0 means households would not change their electricity consumption patterns. The subscript of ifheari refers to whether households understand the policy of the TPHE. The variables of ln price1i and ln price2i and Xi are the same with model (1). This empirical strategy also focuses on the variable of temperature of region p in January denoted by tempp. These control factors may have certain impacts on whether house- holds will improve their energy consumption efficiency after the implementation of the TPHE.
Results of the model (3) are reported in Table 8. Columns (1) and (2) present the outcomes of logistic estimate process and Columns (3) and (4) show the outcomes of the probit model. Among the vari- ables of household energy consumption, the coefficient of electricity price is significantly positive, while the coefficient of gas price is sig- nificantly negative, implying that holding other variables constant, the increase in electricity price will lead to the higher probability of choosing to save more electricity; while the increase in the price of gas will have a negative effect on the probability of saving more electricity. The coefficient of ‘‘whether households understand the policy of the TPHE” is significantly positive, implying that under- standing of the TPHE policy has a positive impact on taking electricity-saving actions. Thus, the publicity of the policy con- tributes to the increase in the residential electricity utilization effi- ciency. The coefficients of the dummy variable of ‘‘the installation of solar water heaters” is also significantly positive, indicating that households who have installed solar water heaters may have more awareness of energy conservation, and thus would be more likely to adopt residential electricity-saving behavior.
6. Conclusions and policy recommendations
The purpose of this study is to investigate the household elec- tricity consumption after the implementation of the TPHE. Using the nationwide survey data of urban and rural households in ten representative provinces in China, we analyze the feedbacks of household electricity usage to the TPHE policy by constructing an empirical model, and evaluate the elasticity of household electric- ity consumption. Major results are as follows: (1) about 72.2% of the surveyed residents understand the price reform, and the group with higher electricity expenditure has higher understanding level of the TPHE; (2) the costs of increased electricity expenditure are mainly borne by households in the third electricity-price tier, accounting for 17.82% of the total samples, whose income levels are relative higher than other income groups. Moreover, electricity expenditures of households in the first and the second tiers almost remained constant; (3) empirical results of the household electric- ity consumption model are basically in line with expectations: the households in the third electricity price tier are more sensitive to those in the second tier, income is positively correlated to electric- ity consumption, households in rural area consume less electricity than those in urban area.
Power tariffs are directly related to household basic rights to use electricity. Therefore, design of the TPHE should include more factors to improve the process of implementation. Based on results of this study, policy suggestions are thus proposed. Firstly, the Chinese government needs to put more efforts in the publicity and transparency of the TPHE. On one hand, it helps to eliminate the misunderstanding of ‘‘disguised price increases” and ease the tension between the reform policy and the general public; on the other hand, it is helpful to promote households to change the inefficient and lavish pattern of electricity consumption.
Secondly, the TPHE needs to be dynamically adjusted with the improvement in residential living standards. Empirical results show that income indeed has an impact on elasticity of electricity consumption and the probability of change in the electricity con- sumption pattern. With the increasing income, a dynamic adjust- ment mechanism should be further designed and be timely publicized to the public to ensure efficiency and fairness.
Thirdly, in the construction of energy adjustment strategy, the elasticity of households’ electricity consumption is a critical factor. Distinct sensitivity to energy price should be taken into considera- tion to guarantee the interest of most people. For instance, the elasticity of electricity consumption in the third electricity-price tier is a bit higher since the average cost of high electricity con- sumption of high income residents rises rapidly from the second tier. In addition, factors such as the gap between urban and rural, and other households’ energy use behavior should be adjusted into the target, which means treatment in accordance with local conditions.
It should be noted that the problem of lacking data acquisition still exists. The data used in the empirical model in this study is the cross-sectional data. If the targeted households are tracked to be interviewed for a longer time, more factors that affect household electricity behavior could be observed and analyzed.
The Chinese government is suggested to gradually and progres- sively promote the design of the TPHE to achieve the maximized efficiency and equity. It can be expected that energy price reform would be proceed to resource products in China, and in order to provide comprehensive implications for policy makers, studies such as the establishment of early warning mechanism, the evalu- ation of the effectiveness of the policy, the enactment of comple- mentary policies and so on and so forth should be conducted to reduce the uncertainties of reforms and to accurately grasp of the possible impacts of reforms.

32,Residential electricity pricing in China: The context of price-based demand response,"As a secondary energy, electricity is an important channel between original energy and energy consumers. Electricity price is a critical factor for the interests of all involvers in the electric power market. It also plays an important role for the sustainable development of energy and environment. Smart grid is a new conception proposed in recent years to improve the intelligent level and increase the efficiency of electric power system operation. Smart grid combines and integrates information technology, communication technology and intelligent control technology with tradition power system. To achieve the many objectives of smart grid, Demand response (DR), as an effective technique of demand side management (DSM), refers to the changes in electricity consumption behavior of users in response to the dynamic price or incentive rewards. Price based demand response (PBDR) is one of the two major DR programs. In this paper, we first introduce the pricing theories in economics, the pricing of electricity and the development of electricity pricing in China. Then, we present a detailed discussion on the PBDR strategies in the DSM of smart grid. Also, the research status of PBDR is reviewed. Finally, it gives a summary of the whole paper in the last Section.","During the past decades, with the rapid development of China's economy and society, fossil energy has been widely exploited and utilized. Due to the large scale fossil energy consumption and the consequent carbon emissions, energy and environment problems are becoming more and more prominent in China. Therefore, it is imperative to construct a safe, effective and sustainable energy system for China. Some new development concepts of energy system such as smart grid, energy internet and internet plus smart energy occurred in recent years [1–4]. Smart gird integrates information technology, network communication technology and intelligent control technology into traditional power system to achieve the interaction between supply side and demand side [5–8]. Smart grid also involves clean energy and distributed energy in the conventional power system. Smart grid can not only guarantee the security, quality and efficiency of energy supply, but also contributes to energy conservation and emission reduction [9]. Energy internet is a huge demand response network which is integrated with transportation system and natural gas system, based on the power system and the Internet technology [10–12]. Energy internet is the further development of smart grid [13]. Demand side management (DSM) is an important part of smart grid to achieve the management goals from demand side [14,15]. Specifically, as an effective technique of DSM, demand response (DR) refers to how the demand side response to pricing strategies or incentive measures from the supply side [16,17]. It is defined as “changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized” [18,19]. DR is an effective way to optimize the electricity consumption, and the costs to implement DR is less than the cost to increase more generation capabilities to achieve peak shaving [20]. The implementation of DR can not only promote supply-demand balance, but also support the provision of cost-effec- tive, high-quality and personalized services to demand side consumers [21]. Generally, DR can be divided into two categories, namely price- based demand response (PBDR) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) [22]. For PBDR, exorbitant electricity prices not only increase the market cost, harm a country's competitiveness, but also suppress the domestic consumption, reduce the social welfare. Also, underpriced electricity prices will hinder the development of power industry and increase waste and pollution [11]. Therefore, how to develop optimal and appropriate electricity price is one of the key issues of smart grid. Currently, there have been some research efforts that focused on the electricity pricing around the world with many meaningful practices [23–27].
Similar to the pricing of other commodities, traditional electricity pricing methods add some profits on the cost [18]. However, it will lead to many problems such as more administrative interventions, mono- poly of state-owned enterprises, lack of competition, low efficiency and difficulties to ensure the rights of consumers [28]. While introducing DR to demand side, electricity consumers will reduce peak electricity usage or move some of the peak consumptions to off-peak periods. It will greatly optimize the way of electricity consumption, significantly improve energy efficiency, effectively conserve resources and reduce pollution [29,30]. DR plays an increasingly important role in the interaction between supply and demand, which is the most important characteristic of smart grid compared with traditional power system [31]. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a survey on the residential electricity pricing in China under the background of PBDR. We aim to summarize the development of electricity pricing in China, discuss the research status of PBDR, and further point out the challenges and opportunities of PBDR in China. This review contri- butes to the theories of DSM and the development of smart grid in China.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the pricing theories in economics, pricing theories of electricity as a special product and the development of electricity pricing in China. Then, DSM and PBDR in smart grids, particularly the PBDR strategies and their research status, are discussed in Section 3. Finally, conclusions are drawn in the last Section. In economics, the equilibrium point is the result of spontaneous adjustment of supply and demand when supply equals demand in the market [32,33]. Supply and demand curves of market and firms are different due to different market types. The firm will get maximum profit when its marginal profit equals to marginal cost no matter it is a competitive firm or a non-competitive firm. In perfectly competitive market, single consumer or firm cannot influence the market price. Market can allocate economic resources effectively in perfectly compe- titive market. But there is rarely perfectly competitive market in practice.
Natural monopoly is a kind of monopoly with high degree of economies of scale [33,34]. Natural monopoly generally exists in utilities such as power sector, water sector and telecom sector, which have pretty high fixed cost and relatively small variable cost. It is more economical under monopoly when market is not so mature, but it will lead to high profit and low efficiency for a monopoly firm [35]. Thus the pricing of a monopoly product is often regulated by the government. The regulations of government will lead to some problems such as price stickiness which contorts the price mechanism. For example, the price will not change immediately even if the supply is excessive when there is regulation.
Electricity product follows the pricing theories in economics as a commodity. But it is a special commodity. Its specialties should be considered when developing electricity product pricing strategies. It differs from normal product in the following aspects.
First, electricity is electrons flow in a conduct under electric potential. It cannot be described by weight, size, color or shape as a normal commodity; either cannot be judged by touching, tasting or smelling. This is why consumers treat electricity product as a special commodity. Second, electricity product is difficult to be stored since power generation, transmission, distribution, substation and consumption are finished nearly at the same time and the supply-demand imbalance may result in serious consequences [36,37]. Besides, it is difficult to adjust energy generation immediately according to the demand of consumers since the power generation is not so flexible while the behaviors of consumers varied [38].
For the electricity pricing, there are static pricing strategies and dynamic pricing strategies for electricity product. Static strategies include traditional flat tariff and step tariff. Traditional flat tariff means a flat tariff with fixed rate plus the cost [39]. It is simple and easy to be implemented. But the flat tariff contorts the pricing mechanism and hinders power sector reform [40]. It is not fair and lack of efficiency to charge the same tariff for consumers with high salary, high power consumption and consumers with low salary, low power consumption [41]. Consumers usually do not have the desire to change their behaviors, such that resulting in grid overload during peak periods and electrical device idle during off-peak periods. Further, it may lead to great resource waste and environment pollution [42]. Step tariff, a.k.a. the tiered pricing, refers to charge with different standards according to the amount of consumption. The different standards are called “step” which is determined by experience and regional char- acteristics. There are increasing block tariff and decreasing block tariff. Generally it refers to the increasing block tariff [43,44]. Step tariff is able to reflect the marginal cost of electricity and the power demand elasticity of residents [41,44–46], so that it can improve the efficiency of energy usage, increase benefits of all producers and consumers. Step tariff can also promote the strengthening of residential energy-save awareness and reduce energy waste [41,47,48]. Step tariff represents an important advance towards power market reform.
Dynamic pricing strategies, which is also called PBDR pricing strategies in smart grid, include time-of-use pricing (TOU pricing), critical peak pricing (CPP), extreme day pricing (EDP), real time pricing (RTP), etc. TOU pricing divides a day into peak, valley and flat periods with different price standards according to the demand of consumers and the actual load of power grid to encourage consumers optimize their behaviors and improve efficiency of power grid [49,50]. Though some researchers believed that TOU pricing is static pricing strategy for its high stability [51], this paper mainly consider its characteristic of interaction between supply and demand. Dynamic pricing strategies, including TOU pricing and CPP, are all useful attempts from flat tariff to RTP. When the electricity price is closer to real time pricing, there will be less deadweight loss.
2.2. Development of electricity pricing in China
The electricity pricing in China has some unique characteristics. First, China has adopted cross-subsidy electricity pricing for several decades, which means that industrial electricity price subsidies resi- dential electricity price. However, the cost of residential electricity is higher than industrial electricity in reality [52]. The cross-subsidy pricing mechanism improves residential living standards on the one hand, but it is harmful to the development of industries and may reduce the overall social welfare [53,54]. It is also believed that cross- subsidy goes against the basic principles of pricing. People with high salary and high electricity consumption usually receive more subsides which is not good for social fairness. Charging the same price during peak and valley periods will result in overload during peak periods and idle devices during off-peak periods. Second, the mechanism of coal- electricity price linkage was implemented since 2004. It refers to that the electricity price is adjusted when coal price changes 5% more than the last period. The period is within six months. If the varied range of coal price is less than 5% than the last period, it will be calculated to next period until it reaches 5% [55]. Electricity tariff was raised twice, first in May 2005 and then in June 2006. But the mechanism of coal- electricity price linkage was suspended as a result of rising concerns over inflation [56]. Coal is the most important resource for power generation in China at the time and in the predictable future. Electricity price should be greatly influenced by the coal price, but it is not reflected in coal-electricity market in China. The government seems reluctant to apply the mechanism of coal-electricity price linkage to avoid inflation and power shortage. But it is time for China to move from a regulated power market to a more market-oriented mechanism. Currently, there have been China has made many attempts. Table 1 summarizes some policies and regulations for electricity pricing in China issued since 2003.
Flat tariff has been implemented in China for a long time until the TOU pricing begun around 1990s [57,58]. The pilot of TOU pricing in China started from 1980. In 2003 the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of China issued the “Notice on the use of price leverage to adjust power supply and demand to promote reason- able electricity consumption”, which proposed the requirement of fully implementation of TOU pricing in China. At present, 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions except Tibet, Guizhou and Guangxi in China have implemented TOU pricing [59,60]. In October 2009, the NDRC drafted “Several opinions about accelerating reform of electricity pricing (draft)” which first proposed the residential tiered pricing reform policies. Also, the NDRC issued “Suggestions on the residential tiered pricing” at the end of 2011 which made clear the details on officially implementation of tiered pricing in China. In July 2012, the residential tiered pricing has been formally implemented in 29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China. The guidance on tiered pricing of NDRC is shown in Table 2. Each region can establish its own tiered pricing scheme. In December 2013, NDRC proposed to popularize TOU pricing by the end of 2015 and to implement a hybrid power system with tiered pricing and TOU pricing. It will be more effective to load shifting when embeds TOU pricing with tiered pricing [61].
In March 15, 2015, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council of China released the “Suggestions on further deepening electric power system reform” to further increase the balance between power supply and demand based on DSM. In October 15, 2015, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council of China released the “Suggestions on promoting the reform of the pricing mechanism”, which proposed to accelerate the reform of energy market, to introduce competition to power generation and electricity retail sectors, to promote diversification of market competition, and to reduce the cross-subsidization and restore the commodity attribute to energy products gradually. Then in November 26, 2015, the NDRC and the National Energy Administration of China (NEAC) issued six supportive documents to “Suggestions on further deepen electric power system reform”. One of the supportive documents clearly pointed out to promote DR and energy market competition, to establish and improve national electric power DSM platform. In summary, China has put price-based DR and DSM as priorities of power market development.
3. Electricity pricing based on price-based demand response
The volatility of the electricity demand often leads load pressure or device idle [62]. DSM can improve energy utilization efficiency by facility improvement, policy surveillance and promoting energy-saving. In addition, it can achieve load shifting by various DR strategies [63,64]. Price-based demand response (PBER) is an effective way to implement DSM in smart grid environment [64].
3.1. Demand side management (DSM) and power market
DSM is a kind of electricity management activity that includes a series of technologies, measures, projects on the demand side to improve efficiency of energy use, reduce cost and reduce emissions [65]. It can be divided to three aspects: energy efficiency management, energy storage management, and demand response. Energy efficiency management reduces the total energy consumption through the improvements of power facilities and policy supervisions. Energy storage management is able to relieve the peak load through the reservation of energy [65]. DR focuses on shifting load by pricing strategies or other incentives. DSM is able to improve the utilization efficiency of electricity products, optimize electricity using manner, save resources, protect environment and minimize the total cost [66]. The participants, benefits, policies and categories of DSM are shown in Fig. 1.
DR is specific technique of DSM. It can be divided into IBDR and PBDR, as shown in Fig. 2. IBDR has two ways in load shifting. First, the power sector directly controls the load of consumers in some degree. Second, consumers response to the incentive measures proposed by the power sector [29,67]. IBDR strategies include Direct Load Control (DLC), Interruptible Load Program (ILP), Demand Bidding and Buyback (DBB), Emergency DR, Capacity Market and Ancillary Service Market, etc [66–69]. Normally the power sector signs contracts with consumers. Consumers will get some rebate if they obey the contract, or they will get some punishments [68–70]. PBDR is the core of DR, which sets different prices on different periods to encourage consumers reducing peak electricity usage or shift peak electricity usage to off-peak periods. The rate is told in advance or real time [71]. IBDR is more dominated by the supply side while PBDR is more dominated by the demand side or by the market [72]. Therefore, IBDR is also called dispatchable DR resource, and PBDR is also called non- dispatchable DR resource [73,74]. Implementation of DR programs can realize the interaction between supply and demand. Consumers are able to change their manners voluntary according to the grid status, and the supply side is able to put the feedback of demand side as a resource to manage and schedule [74,75]. DR can not only reduce grid load, but also shift peak load to off-peak periods, thus improving the efficiency of facility usage and optimizing the energy utilization [76,77].
In the smart grid environment, DR brings benefits to all of the involvers [29]. The domains of smart grid in order to fully realize the potential of DR is shown in Fig. 3.
In the smart grid environment, the price of electricity is usually determined by the interaction and game among different involvers. In a deregulated power market, the costs and benefits of each entity are important factor that driven the formation of electricity price for end- use consumers.
In a fully competitive power market, small consumers can only participate the wholesale electricity market though aggregator. Aggregator is an independent agent, which provides a wide range of innovative services, such as bill management, home management, home electricity generation and other services, to small consumers [30]. As a third party, the aggregator can combine the small consumers into a single purchasing unit to negotiate with the electricity retailer, market operator and transmission company. The competition structure of power market is shown in Fig. 4.
The power system has the following inherent characteristics. First, power supply and demand must keep in balance in real time. Currently, large scale power storage is still unpractical. Also, electricity production costs always vary considerably with different sources and technologies. In addition, electricity consumption behavior of users varies over time and is difficult to predict. There, balance management is of great significance for the power system operation and security. Therefore, based on the competition structure, power market can be divided into forward, day-ahead, intra-day and balancing markets [31].
Electricity pricing is an important way of balance management by changing consumers’ behaviors. The factors influencing DR decisions to promote supply-demand balance are shown in Fig. 5.
3.2. Price-based DR programs and pricing mechanisms
PBDR strategies include TOU pricing, CPP, EDP, Extreme Day CPP, Day-Ahead Dynamic Pricing (DADP) and RTP, etc. In this section, we provide some detailed discussions on some of the above popular PBDR strategies.
TOU pricing recognizes peak, flat and valley periods by experience to charge differently. It is the most widely used PBDR strategy [78]. In China, it generally divides a day into peak period (08:30–11:30, 18:00– 23:00), flat period (07:00–08:30, 11:30–18:00), and valley period (23:00–07:00 the next day) [79]. Many countries divide a year into peak periods and valley periods according to four seasons, rain seasons or dry seasons, summer or non-summer months to charge differently [80]. TOU pricing is easy to be implemented and has great effect on load shifting, though it cannot be strictly called a dynamic pricing strategy for its high stability. Its effectiveness on load shifting has been widely recognized that many areas have implemented TOU pricing for a long time. Currently, there have been some research efforts that focused on how to design and use household appliances based on TOU pricing and the improvement of TOU pricing. Torriti et al. [24] utilized the flat pricing data on July 1st, 2009-June 30, 2010 and TOU pricing data on July 1st, 2010-June 30, 2011 of Trento in northern Italian. They found that, compared with flat pricing, average power consump- tion of residents increased while power consumption spending reduced and the morning rush significantly decreased during TOU pricing. Sun et al. [81] proposed a mathematical model of electric vehicle charging and discharging under TOU pricing, which can achieve the objective of load shifting through guiding the charge and discharge behavior of the electric vehicle. It can also alleviate the pressure of power supply during peak hours by using the electric vehicle as an energy storage unit. Carroll et al. [82] presented a data analysis of smart meters in Ireland and found that smart meters can help to reduce and transfer electricity demand under TOU pricing. However, deadweight losses 
often occurred if the price is determined in advance.
CPP, also called Peak Load Pricing, has the characteristics of TOU
pricing and Emergency Load Control. It charges higher prices on extreme peak periods or on emergency situations, while the rates on other periods remain the same [83]. Both the critical peak periods and the critical peak rates are not fixed. The critical peak periods may be only a few days or a few hours in a year [84]. The power company is likely to inform the consumers for a short time in advance. The power company may sign contracts with consumers to give the users rebates if they obey the contract, otherwise they will get some punishments. This is a kind of combination of PBDR and IBDR. CPP is a supplement to TOU pricing which has some mandatory restrictions for electricity demand in extreme peak periods. Currently, some studies have focused on the design of CPP and demonstrated its effectiveness on load shifting. Ida et al. [85] presented an experiment on electricity consumption in Kitakyushu and Kyoto in Japan from June 26, 2012 to September 14, 2012 by combining CPP day with Variable Critical Peak Pricing and non-CPP day with TOU pricing They found that consumers significantly reduced their peak electricity usage in CPP day compared with the same period in non-CPP day and the higher the price, the less the consumption. Jang et al. [25] provided an empirical study on the response of 802 commercial and industrial users of South Korea to CPP in the winter of 2013, and they found that CPP was effective in reducing peak load.
EDP is similar to CPP which charges high prices to electricity consumption in a certain period. The differences are that EDP charges high prices in the whole extreme day and the price standards are not informed until a day before actual implementation [86,87]. Extreme Day CPP has the characteristics of both CPP and EDP, which imple- ments CPP in several special days and flat price in the other days [88]. The research works on EDP and Extreme Day CPP are limited due to the fact that they are not commonly used in reality.
DADP refers to the electricity price which is informed one day in advance for consumers to make plans for their electricity usage next day [89]. The advantage of DADP is that the price on the next day is clear, so that the users can make plan accordingly to maximize their benefits. However, it means more risks for power company to predict the load situation of the next day and to face other uncertainties. DADP is often used as a premise in dynamic electricity pricing experiments for it is easy to be controlled. Vanthournout et al. [89] examined the performance of household appliances of 58 families in Belgium from September 2013 to July 2014 under the DADP. Chiu et al. [90] developed an energy sale/buyback strategy to maximize the benefits of all parties under the DADP. Paterakis et al. [91] designed a household energy management system to minimize the cost of energy consumption of all kinds of household appliances under the DADP.
The above PBDR strategies, which can achieve load shifting by different ways, are all meaningful trials from flat price to RTP [92]. However, there is still information asymmetry among the above PBDR strategies compared with the RTP. RTP is an electricity pricing strategy that reflects the marginal value of electricity continuously according to the real-time supply and demand situation. Theoretically, RTP is the most reasonable electricity pricing strategy. The devices installed on the demand side can represent electricity users to participate in competitive electricity market and give bids to the market within each short time interval [93]. The supply side reports the clearing price to devices in demand side within each short time interval according to the total demand and supply situation. Then the devices in demand side will record the electricity consumption of consumers with the new price. There have been many researches focused on the advantages of RTP, how to implement RTP and how to protect privacy. Li et al. [94] established a simulation model of household energy consumption and found that the total expenditure on electricity consumption with RTP charge was lower than other pricing strategies. Nilsson et al. [95] studied the effects of RTP on load shifting by measuring the carbon dioxide emissions in different periods and found that RTP has an obvious effect on load shifting. Pecoraro et al. [93] introduced a third- party platform “Load Aggregator” to implement real-time interaction between the supply side and the demand side. Consumers can also sell their redundant electricity through the platform. All of the supply side, the demand side and the “Load Aggregator” can get benefits at the same time. The privacy of consumers is easy to be disclosed under RTP since the demand side devices can detect real-time electricity usage information and report it to the supply side in near real-time. Privacy protection of electricity consumers under RTP is an important research issue. Liang et al. [96] proposed a dynamic pricing strategy that the electricity demands of consumers are reflected in the manner of a community which is able to protect personal privacy while implement RTP at the same time. Ratliff et al. [97] designed a privacy contract between the supply side and the demand side based on smart meters through mathematical modeling, which can guarantee the needed information to the power providers and a degree of privacy protection to the users.
To further illustrate the difference among these PBDR strategies, Fig. 6 shows the patterns and characteristics of three typical PBDR strategies, i.e., TOU, CPP and RTP.
Besides the above DR strategies, some novel DR strategies have also been proposed in recent years. Nelson et al. [36] suggested that tiered pricing and TOU pricing cannot effectively allocate resource in a crowded-market. They proposed an electricity pricing strategy named FDR (First Derivative Ratio). FDR introduced the ratio of demand fluctuation as an important factor of electricity pricing so that the electricity pricing is more effective in a crowded-market. Zhong et al. [98] proposed a pricing scheme called Coupon Incentive-Based Demand Response (CIDR) which offers a flat rate to retail customers and also provides them with voluntary incentives.
3.3. Design of residential electricity price under PBDR
Currently, there have been some electricity pricing models based on PBDR. Here, we summarize some popular models for the design of residential electricity price under PBDR.
3.3.1. Model 1 (Electricity pricing model based on DR)
Within a day of 24 h, the peak period, flat period and valley period are T1, T2 and T3 respectively. The electricity price before TOU pricing is C0 , and the peak, flat and valley prices are CM , C0′ and Cm respectively. If the daily load profile is P = P(t), then total daily electricity consump- tionisw0=∫P(t)dt=w1+w2+w3,wherew1,w2 andw3 arethe amount of electricity consumption in peak, flat and valley period. The strategy of power company is MT−M0 ≥ 0, where M0 and MT are the income of power company before and after implementing TOU pricing. For consumers, the costs are m0 = M0 and mT = MT before and after TOU pricing. So the strategy of consumers is mT ≤ m0. The objective of this model is minimizing the maximum load and the peak valley difference, and the constraints include the benefits and costs of power company and consumers [99,100]. 4. Conclusions
Electricity product, as a special commodity, also follows the pricing theories in economics. But it has highly economies of scale when technologies are immature, which is different from normal commod- ities. Smart grid is a new concept to achieve intelligent operation and management of power system. The PBDR strategies in DSM are new efficient ways for electricity pricing in smart grid, which promote the electricity market reform in China. The most commonly used PBDR strategies are TOU pricing and the combination of TOU pricing and tiered pricing. There are several dynamic pricing strategies based on TOU pricing such as CPP, EDP, Extreme Day CPP, etc. They are all beneficial trials towards the final objective of RTP.
There have been a lot of research efforts and applications of PBDR worldwide. In China, research and applications of PBDR are still in their infancy. However, China has released some policies and regula- tions on introducing competition to power generation sector and retailing sector, improving the balance of supply and demand through DSM, and gradually reducing cross subsidization. These attempts are an important part of China's “Energy Production and Consumption Revolution” strategy.

33,Smart demand response in China: Challenges and drivers,"Smart demand response (SDR) induces change in electricity consumption by end-users, in response to price signals or incentives, via smart infrastructures. In China, SDR programs are instrumental in peak shaving, renewables integration, emissions reduction and grid reliability improvement. Previous literature has not captured the effects of the latest development of electricity market reform on SDR. Our work is distinguished from prior work by (a) comprehensively identifying China-specific SDR challenges, by contrasting these with international experience, (b) identifying effective drivers to overcome new market challenges, and (c) recommending policies and providing insights into China's future SDR development. Our paper identifies three major challenges for SDR development and adoption in China, namely, financial and market, consumer, and infrastructural challenges. In parallel, we identify drivers to overcome these challenges, including electricity market reform, introduction of new market entrants, and development of decentralized electricity systems. Finally, we put forth China-specific policy recommendations, including, continuous market reform, performance-based regulations for national utilities, a level playing field for new market entrants, and investments on consumer-based technologies. These measures aim to create equitable compensations to SDR, align the interests of utilities with SDR initiatives, provide incentives for consumer outreach, and improve the responsiveness of consumers to SDR signals.","Demand Response (DR) is a mechanism that induces change in electricity consumption pattern by offering pricing signals and incen- tives, thereby reducing peak demand and strengthening power system flexibility (Braithwait and Eakin, 2002; FERC, 2012). DR covers intentional modifications on the end-users’ electricity consumption patterns via altering the duration of use, the level of instantaneous demand, and the total electricity consumption (Albadi and El-Saadany, 2007).
DR has traditionally been divided into price-based programs and incentive-based programs. Price-based programs, such as time of use (TOU), real-time pricing (RTP), critical peak pricing (CPP) and peak- time rebate (PTR), provide time-varying pricing to consumers and are often non-dispatchable; incentive-based programs, such as direct load control (DLC), interruptible or curtailable load (IL) and demand side bidding or buyback (DSB) programs, offer incentive payment to load reduction and are often dispatchable (Palensky and Dietrich, 2011; US Department of Energy, 2006).
With the growth in smart infrastructures, DR will increasingly employ smart technologies including: 1) two-way communications interval meters; 2) communication devices that inform customers of load curtailments; 3) energy-information tools that allow baseline and actual usage evaluation, and potential load alerts for utilities; 4) load controller or energy management system (Siano, 2014).
Energy Network Association (ENA, 2012) defines DR invoked in a smart infrastructure as Smart Demand Response (SDR). We elaborate on this and define SDR as any mechanism that induces an intentional shift or passive change of electricity consumption by end-use con- sumers, in response to price signals or incentives, with the assistance of smart technologies.
There is a rich body of literature covering international SDR programs development. The majority of the literature has focused on specific programs and quantified their effects on peak loads shaving (Benetti et al., 2016; Dlamini and Cromieres, 2012; Lee et al., 2012), changes in aggregate consumption (Bradley et al., 2013; Vanthournout et al., 2015), and electricity cost saving (Faria and Vale, 2011; Hussaina et al., 2015; Venkatesan et al., 2011). The common benefits of SDR described in the literature include reducing system peak loads, post- poning infrastructural investments, improving reliability of transmis- sion and distribution networks, and encouraging the adoption of renewable energy technologies (Aghaei and Allizadeh, 2013; Balijepalli et al., 2011; Goel et al., 2006; Sioshansi and Short, 2009).
In China, SDR is particularly relevant in peak shaving, renewables integration, emission reduction and grid reliability. China has a painful history of electricity shortage and forced electricity curtailment. To date, in some parts of China, industrial electricity users would still be asked to reschedule their production in peak-demand seasons (Wang, 2016; Yang, 2016). Despite its leading position in renewable energy installation, China also faces acute challenges in integrating the installed renewables to the grid and in ensuring its reliability (Kahrl et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2016). China is also facing increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, especially emissions from coal. SDR is instrumental in solving these problems. First, SDR has the potential to replace mandatory load shedding, thereby minimizing the disruption to industrial users during the peak hours; second, SDR enhances the flexibility of the electrical system, which in turn increases renewable penetration and grid reliability; third, SDR can be used to shift the coal-fired electricity which has traditionally been used to support the peak loads, therefore substantially reducing coal-fired generated car- bon emissions (Gilbraith and Powers, 2013; Smith and Brown, 2015).
Apart from the above, SDR programs also carry the potential to lessen the challenges that China's electricity sector encounters now or in the near future, such as inefficient pricing, inefficient dispatch and poor capacity planning (Kahrl et al., 2011, 2013). For instance, when a wholesale market emerges in China, SDR programs such as RTP will become instrumental in improving demand-side efficiency; SDR can serve as a capacity resource and contribute to economic dispatch and capacity planning (Aghaei and Alizadeh, 2013; Shariatzadeh et al., 2015; Walawalkar et al., 2010).
Adopting SDR in China presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, challenges in China include the lack of experience, limited investment on SDR, distorted pricing, and the unavailability of advanced technologies (Dong et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Ming et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2010; Yu, 2012; Zhong et al., 2010). On the other hand, market reforms that drive SDR adoption have been introduced in China's electricity sector over the last few years, including the newly introduced market-based pricing for coal-fired electricity and renew- ables such as solar and wind, and the ambitious targets set for smart grid and renewables via regulations, administrative measures and subsidies (Communist Party of China Central Commission, 2015; National Energy Administration, 2016; Xinhua, 2014). Our work is distinguished from prior international literature on SDR by (a) comprehensively reviewing and identifying China-specific SDR chal- lenges, and comparing China's case with international experience, (b) identifying corresponding drivers that can effectively overcome these challenges under the new electricity system in China, and (c) recom- mending measures that can stimulate the adoption of SDR programs in China. Given that SDR will play an important role in shaping China's future electricity system and market, and the carbon trajectory of the electricity sector in China, our insights, especially on how SDR programs can be further developed in China, will tremendously benefit the future electricity system and market in China.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the economic basis for DR and SDR development and adoption. Section 3 provides an overview of such development in China. Section 4 presents the main challenges and Section 5 identifies the main policy drivers to SDR development and adoption. Section 6 concludes the article and summarizes the policy implications and conclusions for SDR develop- ment and adoption in China.
2. Economic basis for demand response and smart demand response development and adoption
DR serves as an effective means to reduce the costs of utilities. In the regulated market, utilities are responsible for the whole spectrum of activities covering power generation, transmission and distribution. In return, utilities obtain a regulated price, usually a flat rate for delivered electricity. Since the adoption of integrated resource planning in the 1970s, utilities have been aware of the high system costs incurred from the peak demand (Cappers et al., 2010). Demand response is a means by which utilities use to balance electricity supply and demand by temporarily shifting the peak demand via pricing mechanisms (Hurley et al., 2013). For example, U.S utilities started to deploy direct load control and interruptible/curtailed program from the 1970s (FERC, 2006). Utilities need to demonstrate that the curtailed load could reduce supply costs relative to an all-generation solution, while providing a service equivalent to displaced generation (Ruff, 2002; US Department of Energy, 2006).
After the introduction of electricity market deregulation in most developed economies, electricity market is separated into a wholesale market and a retail market. In the wholesale market, generation companies bid at the marginal costs and obtain a price reflective of the scarcity of the generation resource. In the retail market, consumers purchase electricity at a regulated price set by the government. Hence, consumers in the retail market will purchase electricity at a price unreflective of the price signals of the wholesale market. Electricity demand will remain inelastic no matter how costly the wholesale price is. DR is therefore proposed to address the price inelasticity by introducing the costs of electricity generation to the retail market. With tools like time-varying pricing and demand curtailment at times of high wholesale prices, DR promises to establish a dynamic demand- side electricity market and an efficient equilibrium between supply and demand (Schweppe et al., 1980, 1982; Spees and Lave, 2007).
DR can also be used to alleviate the abuse of market power and improve market efficiency. Players in the electricity wholesale market, especially the real-time market, own more market power than their counterparts in other commodity market (Borenstein and Bushnell, 2000; Wang et al., 2003). This is because electricity market requires that electricity demand must be met at all times. In the absence of demand elasticity, a generator with even a modest market share is able to demand an extremely high price when capacity resource is in scarcity. The abuse of market power by wholesalers was the primary cause of the California electricity crisis between 2000−2001 (Joskow and Kahn, 2002; Wolak, 2003; Woo, 2001). The same phenomenon has been detected in many other deregulated markets (Woo et al., 2006). DR serves as deterrent to prevent generators from excessive market manipulation. It has been demonstrated that the abuse of market power can be substantially removed by DR, even when demand curtailment is very limited (Blumsack and Lave, 2004; Sweeney, 2002).
DR has been playing an increasingly important role in reducing short-term electricity pricing and in deferring investments on capa- cities and grids. In the United States (U.S.), approximately ten percent of the built capacity has been used to support only one percent of demand hours throughout a year (Feldman et al., 2016). In China, roughly five percent of peak electric load, or about 60 gigawatts, is generated only about 50 hours per year (Greentech Media, 2015). A modest reduction of peak demand can create considerable cost reduc- tion. It is estimated that a reduction of only two to five percent in system-wide demand at peak times can reduce the spot price by at least 50% (Rosenzweig et al., 2003); a five percent reduction in demand during the highest one percent of demand hours can save utilities 5 billion USD per year (Faruqui and Sergici, 2010).
DR is increasingly viewed as a tool to enhance the reliability of the electrical system. In view of the increasing penetration of renewable energy, power supply is expected to become more volatile. Dispatchable demand response can be used to make up for power shortage during contingency events or can even become a regulating resource to provide automated demand reduction (Aghaei and Alizadeh, 2013; Hurley et al., 2013). In areas where ancillary service market is available, programs such as automated interruptible load (IL) can be introduced in the ancillary service market, providing load-shedding service equivalent to that of reserve capacity. 3. Demand response and smart demand response development and adoption in China
Historically, DR did not receive much attention from the Chinese policy-makers (Campbell, 2011). Policy initiatives were mainly focused on supply-side management, covering issues of electricity shortage, market monopolies, pricing mechanisms, resource allocation and optimization, and national grid development (Zhou and Yang, 2015; Williams and Kahrl, 2008). Demand-side management measures usually covered mandatory load shedding and rationing (Hu et al., 2005). Until now, the local governments have continued to issue year- plans on how to “orderly use” electricity, specifying demand quota for big industrial users and setting load shedding instructions for con- sumers to strictly comply with during power shortage.
Given that the old policy measures of cutting off electricity during the period of power shortage has caused tremendous disruption to businesses in China, more attention is paid to DR and SDR. Early DR measures consisted mainly of TOU for industrial users. From 2010, SDR has been put on the national agenda by National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC, 2010). NDRC sets forth electricity saving targets for two national utilities, encouraging utilities to take up the SDR measures. In 2012, four pilot cities, including Beijing, Suzhou, Tangshan and Foshan, were selected by NDRC to take part in trial SDR programs, with funding jointly supported by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the local municipal governments (NDRC and MoF, 2012). Starting from 2015, the national government aims to increase SDR to a level equivalent to 3% of maximum load (National Energy Administration, 2015a).
By 2016, interruptible loads (IL) programs, and real-time DLC programs with control on air conditioners have been introduced in four pilot cities. Participants are remunerated with a fixed compensation (RMB/kW or RMB/kWh). In addition, SDR demonstration projects have also been introduced in the well-developed Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, which are fixed-priced IL solely funded by the local governments (Stern, 2015). These programs require advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to measure the baseline and real time consumption, and communication devices to inform the users of SDR activities and survey their curtailment commitment.
A summary of existing DR (including SDR) programs is shown in Table 1. We note that apart from the TOU program, most DR programs in China can be classified as SDR. Despite the apparent benefits of “non-smart” price-based DR programs, such as RTP (which is not equipped with energy management system), they are not found in China. The adoption of SDR instead of DR programs in China is both practicable and important, given that: 1) price-based DR programs that provide variable wholesale market pricing across the day is dependent on a mature wholesale market, but such a mature wholesale market is not yet established in China (refer to Section 4.1.1); 2) time-varying pricing creates uncertainty and drives income redistribution (Joskow and Wolfram, 2012), and is seldom taken up even in mature electricity markets (FERC, 2011) (also refer to Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2); 3) China is committed to investments of smart infrastructures, making SDR the natural next step to partially recover investment costs (refer to Section 4.3); 4) SDR will significantly advance the integration of renewable energy to the grid, which is highly important for China as it rigorously pushes forward its agenda of renewable energy development (refer to Section 5.3).
In addition, the potential for SDR development in China is promising. In Jiangsu alone, the load shaving by IL and DLC in one demand peak day in 2016 could reach 3.5 GW, representing 3.8% of the maximum demand (State Grid Jiangsu, 2016). Given the target set for SDR and the maximum load in China in 2015, the SDR potential could exceed 25 GW (China Electrical Council, 2015; China Southern Grid, 2016a). However, various key challenges are yet to be overcome in order that full deployment of SDR can be envisaged in China in the near future. . Main challenges of smart demand response development and adoption
Same as other countries, integrating SDR into the electricity system is a challenging task. The main challenges of SDR development/ adoption in China can be broadly divided into three categories: financial and market, consumer, and infrastructural challenges.

33,Smart demand response in China: Challenges and drivers,"Smart demand response (SDR) induces change in electricity consumption by end-users, in response to price signals or incentives, via smart infrastructures. In China, SDR programs are instrumental in peak shaving, renewables integration, emissions reduction and grid reliability improvement. Previous literature has not captured the effects of the latest development of electricity market reform on SDR. Our work is distinguished from prior work by (a) comprehensively identifying China-specific SDR challenges, by contrasting these with international experience, (b) identifying effective drivers to overcome new market challenges, and (c) recommending policies and providing insights into China's future SDR development. Our paper identifies three major challenges for SDR development and adoption in China, namely, financial and market, consumer, and infrastructural challenges. In parallel, we identify drivers to overcome these challenges, including electricity market reform, introduction of new market entrants, and development of decentralized electricity systems. Finally, we put forth China-specific policy recommendations, including, continuous market reform, performance-based regulations for national utilities, a level playing field for new market entrants, and investments on consumer-based technologies. These measures aim to create equitable compensations to SDR, align the interests of utilities with SDR initiatives, provide incentives for consumer outreach, and improve the responsiveness of consumers to SDR signals.","Access to functional electricity markets and allowing SDR to be dispatched according to marginal costs are crucial to enable efficient allocation of resources and least-cost provision of services. In places where SDR flourishes, curtailment from SDR programs is taken as equivalent to generation in the electricity market. For example, in some markets in the U.S., such as PJM, SDR programs account for 10% of total resources, largely because of the availability of the capacity market. Front-runners in the EU, such as the UK, France and Belgium, allow bidding of SDR resources in the ancillary service market (Eid, 2015).
Currently, the Chinese government tightly controls the electricity system. On the generation side, the central government establishes on- grid tariff for each province to guide the sales price of power. On the retail side, electricity prices for both industrial and residential users are set by the local government (Ma, 2011). Since power generated from all primary resources is essentially paid the same price, dispatch is controlled by the two national utility companies with an aim to evenly distribute the production hours to all generators, regardless of the type of primary resource, generator capacity and emission (Fig. 1). Under such a structure, compensation for consumers as a result of demand reduction can only be based on fixed subsidies instead of competitive market pricing, in the absence of a wholesale market.
Fixed remuneration towards SDR also poses another problem. Regulators in all SDR pilot cities adopt the fixed remuneration scheme where curtailment from SDR is priced at a set amount per kilowatt- hour. Since the cost of SDR is determined based on the opportunity costs and comfort loss, which vary substantially across users and could not be readily judged by reference to generation cost, the valuation of SDR is essentially the regulators’ best guess. The mandated price could easily be too low to encourage participation or too high to over- compensate the curtailment. For example, study shows that the fixed remuneration price for IL in Italy is three times greater than the benefits for interruption (Torriti et al., 2010). Only by eliminating regulatory barriers and ensuring access to the electricity market can SDR be properly valued and compensated (Energy Pool, 2015).
Apart from the lack of proper SDR valuation, the current power system presents a conflict of interest between the utility companies and SDR programs. On the one hand, utility companies earn profits from the fixed price difference between the retail price and on-grid tariff. The more kilowatt-hours sold, the higher the profits. On the other hand, utility companies are also in charge of promoting all programs relating to demand side reduction. Utility companies are bound to lose money if their SDR programs shrink user consumption. For example, China Southern Power Grid (CSG) reported that residential TOU in Zhejiang province resulted in substantial revenue loss, and suggested that CSG should avoid rolling out programs similar to those in Zhejiang (Li, 2012). Unless regulators undertake to reform the business model of state-owned grid companies and realign their interests with reduced electricity consumption, China is unlikely to witness any enthusiastic support for SDR programs.
4.1.2. Costs of smart demand response development and adoption
The majority of SDR costs consist of: system costs, which include utility investments in smart infrastructures, program management and consumer education; and participant costs, which include comfort cost, opportunity cost and user investments in SDR-enabling technologies, such as automated control and energy management system (US Department of Energy, 2006).
Internationally, a majority of utilities (or other entities in charge of SDR infrastructure installation) recovers the system costs through direct consumer surcharge or rate increase. For example, Spain, Sweden, UK and many other countries, through legislative or regula- tory actions, allow utilities or energy suppliers to recover their smart meter installation costs across the entire consumer base (Altmann et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2005; Lijesen, 2007; Warren, 2014). To spur investment on SDR from utilities, some regulators have treated the SDR investment on an equal footing as transmission assets, permitting a fair rate of return (Shen, 2013). Some regulators even allow the inclusion of revenue loss in the surcharge since SDR could dampen utilities’ sales. There are also some countries that provide direct funding to SDR. One instance is the Smart Grid Investment Grant in the U.S., which provides up to 50% funding to SDR-enabling technol- ogies, and is expected to promote AMI installation to 16 million consumers (Felder, 2013; US Department of Energy, 2014).
Participant costs are recovered from the payment for SDR curtail- ment in the electricity market. For example, U.S. regulator establishes that DR curtailment is to be paid the locational marginal prices as generation resources; SDR could commit energy reduction in capacity market three years in advance to gain the payment for capacity in some balancing authority areas such as PJM and ISO-NE (Aghaei and Alizadeh, 2013; Shariatzadeh et al., 2015; Walawalkar et al., 2010); In EU countries such as the UK and France, SDR with short response time is eligible to seek remuneration for balancing the system through the ancillary service market (Torriti et al., 2010; Warren, 2014).
In China, the government plays a dominant role in recovering both the system costs and the participant costs associated with SDR. For the system costs, national utilities have received financial support from both the central and local governments for recovering the investments in smart infrastructures, such as smart meters. For the participant costs, the government would directly reimburse the participants via direct funding or legislative action. For example, the payments for curtailment in the four SDR pilot cities and the automated SDR demonstration project in Shanghai are both directly funded by the MoF and local governments (Stern, 2015); Beijing has legislation in place dictating that the payment for IL should derive partially from a utility's extra revenue collected from the high peak price (Beijing Municipal Government, 2011).
The current cost recovery mechanism presents two challenges. Firstly, even though China has stepped up funding for utilities to recover system costs, especially in the deployment of smart meters, the funding support to cover participant costs is far from adequate. Central government funding has been targeted at the major regions, such as Shanghai, Beijing and Jiangsu. Apart from several pilot cities, local governments are reluctant to pay for SDR out of their own budgets. Secondly, relying on government funding alone for covering participant costs is neither fair nor sustainable. The price for curtailment is set without thorough studies and the costs are shared by all tax-payers rather than the rate-payers who benefit from SDR. A possible solution to overcome these two challenges would be a formal cost recovery mechanism, via establishing functioning wholesale markets and ancil- lary service markets.
4.1.3. Smart demand response program design
In the past decade, TOU was the most prevalent form of DR programs in China. For the deployed TOU programs, the price design for the peak and off-peak periods were not tested in trial programs locally and systematically to account for the social, economic and geographic characteristics. Instead, the peak and off-peak prices were mostly set by local administrative orders. Therefore, prices are set based on the power wrestling between industrial users, grid companies and the local government. International experience shows that poorly structured tariffs will be ineffective in inducing consumer response (Faruqui et al., 2010a, 2010b; Faruqui and Sergici, 2010) and reducing total operation cost (Herter and Wayland, 2010; Torriti et al., 2010). Pricing should take seasonal, industrial and macro-economic factors into account and needs to be revised regularly to ensure that the pricing is capable of smoothing out demand peaks, reducing network conges- tion, and lowering generation costs.
It is important for China to pay more attention to incentive-based SDR, rather than relying heavily on price-based DR programs. Incentive-based SDR programs such as DLC are reliable options that could be dispatched to meet demand, while potential peak load reduction is uncertain when it comes to price-based programs. Internationally, incentive-based SDR constitutes an important part of demand side management. In Italy, interruptible programs represent 6.5% of the peak power (Grattieri, 2006). In the U.S., of all the DR programs, incentive-based programs offered 93% peak reduction in 2008 (Cappers et al., 2010). China still has a long way to go in the development of incentive-based SDR programs.
4.2. Consumer challenges
4.2.1. International challenges
Low consumer acceptance of SDR has been noted in currently adopted SDR programs internationally. For example, a mere 10% recruitment rate can be expected if the U.S. households are solicited on time-based DR programs (Todd et al., 2013). We identify four consumer challenges, namely, adverse selection, marginal benefits, consumer engagement difficulty and low consumer adaptability.
First, adverse selection occurs when the price-based SDR program offered is taken up by users who have contributed very slightly to peak demand reduction. For example, it is difficult for utilities to enroll users who has a high usage during peak hours because these users are concerned about the potential bill increase (Horowitz and Woo, 2002; Woo et al., 2014). Instead, the “non-premium users” who consume most of the energy during non-peak hours are most likely to join, because they could benefit most from the low off-peak price. As “non- premium users” shift to consume electricity during low-price off-peak hours, revenue of the utilities will eventually shrink. Therefore, utilities are cautious about rolling out price-based program, if additional support has not been provided by the regulators.
Second, the financial benefits of SDR adoption are not significant enough to motivate participation. For residential users, cost savings from participating in SDR programs are negligible. A study found that participation in DR could only reduce household expenditure by 0.84% in the U.S. (Kim and Shcherbakova, 2011). SDR will mainly benefit industrial and commercial users of high electricity demand. For instance, for big consumers such as the aluminium manufacturing industry, which spends 40% of its total expenditure on electricity consumption, they can benefit significantly from SDR (Royal Bank of Canada, 2015). However, electricity curtailment means reducing the production. Unless the reward for SDR is greater than the production loss, industrial users would not voluntarily take part in the program.
Third, difficulty to engage consumers presents an additional barrier to SDR adoption. Very often, electricity users do not have any clue on the nature and availability of SDR programs. Electricity purchase is routine and passive and is greatly affected by habits and inertia (Giulietti et al., 2000; Parmar et al., 2000; Watson et al., 2002). As a result, most users tend to stay with their current plans. Therefore, consumer engagement that reaches out to consumers is essential for SDR program enrollment. Implementing effective consumer engage- ment programs, however, is difficult, as it involves a mixture of market research, targeted messaging, media and public relation campaigns, all of which requires dedicated funding and careful planning (US Department of Energy, 2016). A survey found that less than 35% of U.S. utilities consider their outreach programs to be good at motivating residential users to act as the programs intended, and only 2% consider that they have done a “great job” (Utility Dive, 2015).
4.2.2. China-specific challenges
Both industrial users and residential users face challenges in
adopting SDR in China. For industrial users, only a limited number of SDR programs are available and remuneration schemes are lacking. For residential consumers, limited communications and limited efforts put on marketing of SDR rollouts have resulted in low SDR acceptance. However, since residential energy demand only represents a small portion of the total energy demand in China, challenges faced by industrial users should receive more attention. The identified chal- lenges are as follows:
First, for industrial consumers, SDR has great potential in China but is yet to be integrated into their operations. Even though traditional DR programs such as TOU is enforced on large industry users, new SDR programs such as automated IL and CPP are yet to be available or still on trial. To ensure the safety operation of the power system, the government requires an “orderly use” of electricity, accomplished via quota system and mandatory load shedding (NDRC, 2011a). In this “orderly use” plan, each county is assigned a quota for maximum power usage. The county will then assign a maximum power demand quota to each industrial user, who would face penalty or mandatory load shedding if the quota is exceeded (Kahrl and Wang, 2014). Apart from the “orderly use” plan, regulators also make provisions annually for power shortage, and specify the order on which users will be required to shed their loads. Such measures will disrupt business operations and incur huge costs due to rescheduling or forced shut down of operations. Hence, SDR provides the flexibility for businesses to decide whether they would like to reduce their demand in response to the SDR signals (e.g. peak demand signals). However, such programs are still emerging given that electricity demand is under tight control by the government.
Second, consumer research in relation to SDR is minimal and not much effort has been done to promote consumer engagement. Consumer research that aims to understand and observe consumer consumption behaviors is important for engaging consumers. They provide justification for SDR rollout and allow fine tuning of consumer engagement programs to target users with the highest potential (Gangale et al., 2013). In China, however, such studies are scarce. Possible reasons for the lack of consumer research are low public funding and reluctance of national utilities to publicize relevant data. In the absence of consumer studies, the number of effective consumer engagement programs is minimal. There are very few attempts con- ducted by the national utilities to engage the customers and promote SDR programs. China has committed less on target messaging, social media and community seminars, which are effective engagement measures being practised overseas (Utility Dive, 2015). SDR programs often rely on state media reports in China. Such reports appear to be unconvincing and are not tailor-made to reach the most responsive users.
Third, the savings for residential consumers are minimal. The residential tariffs are set at a very low level by the government, at about 90% of the rates of industrial users. This practice is against the international norm which usually sets the residential price 1 or 2 times higher than the rates of industrial users. One can easily overlook the savings from SDR because electricity expenses only account for 1.71% of total household expenditure (Zheng et al., 2015). Saving a small amount of money from SDR requires one to devote a disproportio- nately higher amount of effort. Take Beijing for example, saving one USD requires the shifting of 32kWh from peak to off-peak period (Beijing Commission of Development and Reform, 2006). Considering that a great majority of households in Beijing consumes less than 240kWh per month (NDRC, 2011b), the effort spent on shifting electricity usage in order to save a very small portion of the bill is not attractive to most householders.
4.3. Infrastructural challenges
Smart infrastructures, in particular advanced metering infrastruc- ture, are the prerequisites for SDR programs. Users with smart meters are able to keep track of load control event, price of electricity, cost of consumption, or even indirect carbon dioxide emission. Utilities can also use the smart infrastructures to transmit pricing and control signals, monitor consumption patterns, measure and verify responses. A plan to install smart infrastructures and recover their costs is essential to the success of any SDR programs.
Internationally, governments are the principal drivers of smart infrastructure installation, either through legislative mandates or direct funding. The European Union has committed itself through the Third Energy Package to an 80% electricity smart meter penetration by 2020 (European Commission, 2016). The U.S., through the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, has directly supported the transition to smart grid.
The Chinese government also plays a pivotal role in smart infra- structure project. In some cases, the Chinese government is more aggressive than other countries in pursuing smart infrastructure deployment. Smart infrastructural investment is codified in the govern- ment plans and utilities are working closely with the central and local governments to enforce such plans. A good example is the fast adoption of smart meters. Unlike western countries where concerns about privacy raised opposition to smart meter installation, such concerns have never entered the public discourse. The Chinese government is committed to fund the rollouts of new advanced meters with smart functionalities to 90% of all users by 2020 (National Energy Administration, 2015b). In 2015 alone, more than 90 million units have been installed (Reportlinker, 2016). Such rapid and mass deployment has been criticized by some as not making any economic sense with very low chance of cost recovery (Stern, 2015). Nevertheless, it would certainly contribute to the modernization of China's grid system.
The key challenge that associates with smart infrastructures in China, however, is that the adoption of consumer-based technology adoption greatly lags behind the pace of smart meter installation. In countries such as the UK, in-home displays are required with the smart meter installation. In China, however, most smart metering users are still unable to access the usage data. Smart meters are restricted to mere automatic reading and remote disconnect in case of bill overdue. Other supporting smart enabling technologies, such as load control devices, communicating thermostat, and energy management system are yet to be in place. Up till now, only four selected pilot cities have provided incentives for investment in SDR-enabling technologies. Stronger support for SDR-enabling technologies adoption is needed to complement smart meter adoption in China.
5. Drivers of smart demand response development and adoption
5.1. Electricity market reform
5.1.1. Emergence of market-based electricity wholesale market
Since 2015, a new series of reforms has been introduced to improve electricity market pricing and dispatch. Central to the reform is an order (Order No. 9) which targets at dispatching generation resources through bilateral agreement or a centralized auction-based trading design (Communist Party of China Central Commission, 2015). Ultimately, the reform will create a wholesale market free from the state-mandated pricing (Fig. 2). SDR can benefit from such reform as the wholesale market can provide a venue where its value could be determined and realized.
As with other reforms in China, the new series of electricity market reforms takes an evolutionary approach. Each province can kickstart the reform at its own speed. The annual electricity production plan, which was used to distribute electricity generation to each plant, will be gradually phased out and replaced by contracts signed through bilateral trading and centralized trading. Exchanges are being set up to facilitate centralized trading and finalize monthly or yearly future contracts, including two trans-provincial exchanges in Guangzhou and Beijing. The contracts signed through centralized trading are mainly year-ahead or month-ahead future contracts. As of the first half of 2016, over 15% of electricity demand is met by centralized trading in exchanges (China Electrical Council, 2016; China Southern Grid, 2016b).
Functioning wholesale market provides the venue for SDR pricing and cost recovery, and is fundamental for SDR programs such as demand side bidding or buyback. Up till now, China has yet to allow SDR to enter the new wholesale market. However, Order No. 9 has explicitly stated that certain SDR programs, such as IL, can be included in the future electricity market. It is therefore reasonable to expect that as the wholesale market matures, SDR programs can be introduced in the future electricity wholesale market.
Included in the electricity reform plan is the introduction of an ancillary service market, which provides an important channel for SDR to recover the participant and system costs. Incentive-based SDR programs, such as IL, DLC and DSB programs, fit well with the ancillary service because they offer load curtailment services that can be quantitatively measured and quickly rendered. Ancillary service has long been considered the obligation of generators and has been acquired free of charge in China. Order No. 9 requires new schemes to be established that would allow ancillary service providers to be rewarded for their services and the service costs be shared among all beneficiaries. As of 2016, nearly all provinces and regions have established some forms of ancillary service compensations, often fixed amount of money per kilowatt hour. Ancillary service providers can claim compensations once they have provided the service above a state- defined level. For example, for any thermal plants within the provinces covered by the Southern Grid, each can receive 3 RMB/kWh with an achievement of 40–50% rated capacity, and 6RMB/kWh for an achievement of 30–40% of rated capacity (National Energy Administration, 2015c). There also has been increasing signs that ancillary service based on market pricing will soon be rolled out. In Northeast China, pilot programs that adopt the market pricing schemes for ancillary service are being deployed. SDR will eventually receive paybacks when ancillary service market becomes a reality in China.
5.1.2. Regulating monopolies in the electricity market
New regulations are expected to fundamentally change the business model of the national utilities. In the future, the national utilities will not make profits from the difference in electricity sales and procure- ments. Rather, they can operate via the service charge from transmis- sion. The transmission charge will be regulated by the state, and set at a level that allows the utilities to recover the operating costs and earn a fixed profit margin based on their asset values. In this way, the utilities’ revenue can be effectively decoupled from the electricity sales (NDRC, 2015).
Access to distribution and retail will also be opened as the reform proceeds. For electricity distribution, distribution service providers (DSPs) are allowed to invest in networks below 220 kV and earn revenues from collecting distribution charge. Retail suppliers are allowed to serve the consumers by procuring electricity from the market (Fig. 2). National utilities would have to compete with the new retail suppliers in the future (NDRC, 2016a). New regulations on national utilities and the emergence of retail suppliers and DSPs are set to benefit SDR in two ways in the future. Firstly, new regulations on national utilities could eliminate the tension between the SDR development and the profits of utilities. National utilities would be encouraged to actively engage in investment in SDR infrastructures because enhanced SDR assets boost the profits they are allowed to make. Secondly, emerging retail suppliers have a higher incentive to promote price-based SDR in the future because the SDR programs help reduce costs of purchasing electricity during the peak demand period when the prices are high. Dispatchable SDR that enters the wholesale market in the future could also generate a new source of revenue for retailers. Thirdly, because retail suppliers must compete with the national utilities in market share, they will be more likely to engage consumers and convince the consumers to overcome the adoption inertia. With adequate incentives, retail suppliers would be more competent than the national utilities in marketing SDR.
Nevertheless, new regulations on national utilities are in need of improvement as they are still subject to profit manipulation such as over-investments in fixed assets. A possible solution is to introduce performance-based regulations, by rewarding utilities based on goal achievements, such as cost reduction, reliability enhancement, envir- onmental performance and consumer service provision (Aggarwal and Burgess, 2014; Mandel, 2015).
5.2. The emergence of demand aggregators
Demand aggregators serve as mediators between users and utilities and are specialized in offering SDR to a pool of users. Aggregators are necessary for SDR programs in many cases. On the one hand, utilities in the electricity market usually set high standards for their SDR programs, requiring the program participants to acquire a certain level of response potential. For small users to overcome the threshold, a demand aggregator is needed to pool together the response potential of small users. On the other hand, users are not normally aware of their response potentials and the benefits of SDR. As specialists in SDR, demand aggregators provide solutions for users to tap into the response potential, via offering energy management advices and installing enabling technologies (Gkatzikis et al., 2013). In the U.S., aggregators serve as an integral part of the SDR programs, frequently bidding for curtailment capacities in the energy market in PJM and NYISO (Shariatzadeh et al., 2015).
Aggregators have emerged in pilot cities in China where SDR programs have been deployed. In Jiangsu, Beijing and Foshan, demand aggregators have come into play since 2015. Aggregators in China can first engage users and negotiate the terms for load curtailments, and then enroll the aggregated loads in utility-offered SDR programs, and seek rewards for load curtailments. When there is an SDR signal, aggregators are responsible for alerting the users of the day-ahead programs and managing load reductions with control devices (real- time programs). Because of their capabilities in raising awareness and tapping into the response potentials, aggregators will play an important role in SDR in China.
5.3. A renewable and decentralized electricity system
5.3.1. Integration of renewables to the grid
To reduce carbon emissions and provide new momentum for economic growth, China is rapidly deploying renewables. The Chinese government has committed to supply 20% of total energy with non-fossil fuels in 2030 (Xinhua, 2014). By the end of 2015, 173 GW of renewables (wind 130 GW, solar 43 GW) have been installed, account- ing for over 11.5% of total installed capacity (Bureau of Statistics, 2016), making China the world leader in renewable energy in terms of capacity installation.
The current electricity system is inflexible and encounters consider- able challenge to accommodate the huge increase in renewables. Due to the intermittent nature of renewables, the electrical system must be flexible enough to compensate for the fluctuation of outputs by renew- ables. However, the current market design and energy mix have made the achievement of system flexibility extremely difficult in China (Feng et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Due to the dominance of coal-fired power generation, coal-fired power is mostly used to follow loads in China (Kahrl and Wang, 2014; Yao et al., 2015). However, it takes a longer time for coal-fired power plants to ramp up and down as compared to hydropower or natural gas counterparts. Even worse, the coal-fired plants in China are especially inflexible because of the prevalence of combined heat and power (CHP) plants that cannot be ramped down easily because of heating needs (Kahrl et al., 2011; Martinot, 2015). As a result, renewable energy is frequently curtailed to ensure grid stability. During the first half of 2016, the curtailment rate of wind has reached a historically high record of 21%. In the Northeast and Northwest regions, this figure can reach 40% (Global Wind Energy Council, 2016).
SDR will become increasingly important in China as it plays an instrumental role in renewables integration. Various studies have con- firmed that incorporating DR helps level out variations in renewables output and reduce renewable energy curtailment (De Jonghe et al., 2014; Dietrich et al., 2012; Dupont et al., 2014; Sioshansi and Short, 2009). The Chinese government has also realized the importance of SDR in integrat- ing renewables as SDR is listed as a means to tackle the renewables curtailment problem (NDRC, 2016b). Government attention to renewable integration will become a key driver for future SDR development.
5.3.2. Development of a decentralized electricity system
The agenda for a decentralized electrical system has been increas- ingly pursued all over the world. A decentralized electricity system, standalone or grid-connected, has been proven to be capable of postponing transmission and distribution investment, and of increas- ing the reliability and reducing transmission loss (Borges, 2012; Kaundinya et al., 2009; Pepermans et al., 2005; Ravindra and Iyer, 2014; Anaya and Pollitt, 2014). Many states in the U.S. and the European countries have adopted “net metering” or Feed-in-tariff (FIT) to stimulate the growth of distributive generation. In the U.S., nearly half of the newly installed solar capacity were derived from distributed solar in 2015 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016). In European countries, such as Germany, majority of solar energy is generated from decentralized distribution networks (Wirth, 2014).
China has also begun to develop decentralized electricity systems. Starting from 2013, Chinese distributive PV users are eligible for two kinds of subsidies: they can either sell all the generated electricity to the grid with state-sanctioned FIT, or they can opt for a reinforced form of “net metering”, where not only the sold-back portion is paid with subsidies (FIT), but also the consumed portion (National Energy Administration, 2013). Other supporting policies such as grid access guarantee, favorable taxation and technology innovation support have also been recommended (Zhao et al., 2015). Same as other countries, the Chinese government has provided strong support for decentralized electrical system, especially for distributive solar.
SDR is a key component of a decentralized electricity system. First, smart infrastructures that enable two-way energy flow and measure- ment, such as smart meters and smart inverters, are prerequisite to a decentralized system. Second, flexible adjustment of demand enabled by SDR is used to respond quickly to the intermittent output of renewables within the decentralized system. Programs such as RTP and IL with automated control could be used to modulate demand at short notice (Cappers et al., 2012; Rahimi and Ipakchi, 2010). Coupled with other smart technical tools such as active network management (Anaya and Pollitt, 2017), SDR could greatly enhance the reliability of the decentralized system.
6. Policy implications and conclusions
SDR promises electricity service with lower costs and increased reliability. It reduces supply costs by producing the same service at a lower cost. In China, replacing mandatory load shedding and rationing with well- designed SDR can avoid costly disruption to business. SDR is also instrumental in boosting flexibility of the electricity system, thereby increasing renewable penetration and improving system reliability.
SDR faces many challenges in China. With respect to market issues, China has yet to establish functioning electricity markets where resources can be dispatched according to marginal costs. SDR programs rely solely on government support to recover their costs. Apart from several pilot cities, no formal mechanism has been established to recover participant costs such as opportunity cost and investments in consumer-based technologies.
SDR also faces consumer and infrastructural challenges. Users are not keen to join SDR due to limited financial benefits and ineffective consumer engagement. Even though China has poured money into smart infrastructures, especially smart meters, investments in con- sumer-based technologies such as automated control and energy management systems are lacking.
Meanwhile, drivers that create the enabling environment for SDR implementation can be found in parallel. The ongoing electricity market reform in China serves as the key driver for SDR development in the future. China is committed to wholesale market development and enabling dispatch based on marginal costs. Transactions based on bilateral and centralized trading have been on the rise and ancillary service markets are being established. In the future, a mature wholesale market can provide the venue where SDR programs can bid curtail- ments on the same footing as generation resources. National utilities are gradually transforming themselves into new business models, such that SDR development will not undermine profit-making. New market entrants, such as retail suppliers, DSPs and demand aggregators, are emerging and are incentivized to promote SDR development.
The increasing penetration of renewables also drives SDR develop- ment. The current electrical system in China is inflexible and faces considerable challenge to accommodate the increasing penetration of renewables. SDR has the potential to change the load to better accommodate the variation in renewables output, thus allowing more renewables to be integrated to the grid.
Taking into account of the above challenges and drivers, we recommend the following China-specific policies to be introduced to further promote SDR development in China.
First, the Chinese government should continue market reform and establish functional electricity markets that enable dispatch of curtail- ment and generation resources according to the marginal costs. However, this goal could only be achieved gradually. Currently, as electricity markets are transitioning to wholesale markets, SDR policies should target at providing strong incentives to current and emerging programs. The government must ensure that curtailment by users is remunerated with payment above the curtailment cost. As China gradually establishes its electricity markets, policies should be intro- duced to facilitate the direct participation in SDR programs. More efforts should also be devoted to building ancillary service markets, where dispatchable SDR programs could enter and seek remuneration. A good start for the ancillary service markets would be the Northwest provinces, where massive renewable energy is severely curtailed.
Second, to address the consumer challenges, the government should continue to improve the business models of the national utilities and build a level playing field for new market entrants. The financial interests of national utilities have to be aligned with SDR. One possibility can be introducing performance-based regulations. This can effectively eliminate the conflict between SDR and utility profits, and overcome the profit manipulation by national utilities. For new entrants that are more inclined to take up SDR programs, policy-makers should ensure that they are treated fairly when competing with national utilities. To increase SDR participation, retail suppliers may engage consumers through a combina- tion of market research, targeted messaging, media and public-relations campaigns. Cross subsidies for residential users should be eliminated so that they can benefit more from SDR programs. Special attention should be given to industrial users when deploying SDR as they represent the largest SDR potential in China.
Third, to tackle the smart infrastructural challenges, more efforts should be put in promoting consumer-based technologies that enhance automation and facilitate control and communication between utilities and users. The large-scale installation of smart meters by the Chinese government should be matched by corresponding investments in enabling technologies to fully realize the AMI potential.
In conclusion, SDR can play a critical role in balancing future electricity supply and demand in China. Nevertheless, key challenges remain to be tackled, including: incomplete market reform, under-incentivized consu- mers and lopsided smart infrastructural development. To tackle these challenges, we recommend that China-specific policies, namely, continuing electricity market reform, performance-based regulations for national utilities, a level playing field for new market entrants and investments in consumer-based technologies be introduced. By reviewing and identifying the key challenges and drivers of SDR in China, and recommending effective China-specific policies, our paper provides important policy insights into China's SDR development and adoption.

34,Study on the promotion of natural gas-fired electricity with energy market reform in China using a dynamic game-theoretic model,"Natural gas-fired electricity (NGFE) has gained great attention in China recently. However, the high generation cost leads to the NGFE cannot compete economically with the coal-fired electricity (CFE) when the value of peak power and positive environment externality of NGEF are not considered. Therefore, the market reform of natural gas (NG), including price deregulation, carbon tax and environmental subsidy are of vital importance to promote the penetration of NGFE. In the present study, a dynamic game-theoretic model was developed to analyze the impacts of market reforming for natural gas on the promotion effect of NGFE, in which the hourly real-time pricing (RTP) was applied in both natural gas and electricity markets. Five scenarios were proposed with different policy combinations of pricing mechanism reform, carbon tax and environmental subsidy. Based on the analysis results, it can be concluded that (i) deregulating the NG price, imposing carbon tax and adopting environment subsidy can promote the market penetration of NGFE greatly; and (ii) the market deregulation can increases the share of NGFE to 5.49%, and imposing the carbon tax of 100RMB/tonne CO2 can raise it further to 7.66%, furthermore if the environmental subsidy of 134.3 RMB/MWh is also included, the share of NGFE can reach 15%.","China has predicted that its CO2 emissions will reach peak before 2030. In order to mitigate the CO2 emissions, natural gas (NG), as the‘‘cleanest” fossil fuel, has gained increasing attention in China. NG has already been widely used in residential sector and industry sector nowadays. With the West-East Gas Pipeline and transnational gas pipelines coming into operation, China’s NG consumption in recent years has grown rapidly. Its average annual growth rate reached 15.44% in the period of 2000–2014. However, at present, the NG industry is facing a big challenge that the further increase of consumption is hindered by its high price. Nowadays, the development of natural gas-fired electricity (NGFE) is still at an initial stage in China, accounting for a small amount, 3.3% in power generation composition in 2013 [1]. Although renewable energies are more environment-friendly com- pared with NGFE, they still cannot economic competitive enough compared with NG especially in a large scale. Moreover, technolo- gies advances [2] are allowing NG to provide power with high ramp-up and ramp-down speed that can deal with the intermit- tency of renewable energies. Compared to coal-fired electricity (CFE), NGFE is preferable to supply the peak demand due to its fast ramp-up and ramp-down rates and NGFE’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is 60% lower than that of CFE. At present, because the advantages of NGFE are not considered in the markets, it is hard for NGFE to compete with CFE due to the high cost issue. According to the latest national energy strategy plan [3], Chinese government has made a plan to increase the share of NG in the total primary energy from 5% in 2013 to 10% by 2020. To achieve that target, a series of policies and measures have been made to promote the market penetration of NGFE [4] to replace CFE [5,6]. Nevertheless, the increase of NGFE is still very slow. Previously, energy prices, such as NG and electricity, are regulated by Chinese government. For example, today’s NG price in Beijing is fixed at a relatively high level which is equal to 3.65 RMB/Nm3 ($17.04/ MMBtu) [7]. Moreover, the government doesn’t subsidize the power plant when generating power with low CO2 emissions, such as NGFE. In order to further improve the competitiveness of NGFE, it is of great importance to reform the regulated markets for both NG and electricity and internalize the environmental externality in the pricing mechanism.
Nowadays, the hub-based pricing mechanism is the dominated method applied in the North American NG market. According to this pricing mechanism, only pipelines and local distribution com- panies are directly regulated with respect to the services they pro- vide, and the NG prices are no longer regulated by the government [8]. The NG pricings in Japan include imported LNG pricing and NG retail pricing. JCC (Japan Crude Cocktail) link price is implemented for imported LNG nowadays that is determined as JCC  negotiated price slope + constant term, which represents the average monthly price of a basket of various crude oil imported into Japan and moves in line with other global crude benchmarks. Slope defines the rela- tionship between oil and NG prices. Constant term generally repre- sents a fixed price element that is independent of oil movement [9]. For example, a crude basket price of $100/barrel with a 15% slope and $2.00/MMBtu premium would yield an LNG import price of $17.00/MMBtu [10]. As for retail price, cost-plus method was used initially and market-oriented pricing mechanism through negotia- tion between suppliers and consumers was adopted since 1955. In Europe, its mid-stream utilities that are obliged to purchase NG under long term contracts are normally priced in a way linked to oil products [11]. Hub-based pricing, which is similar to the North America [12] has been applied to about 53% of the NG market in Europe in 2013. According to the experiences of the developed countries, one of key points of market reform for China is to intro- duce price deregulation that can allow the NG price varies dynamically. There have also been some studies in China evaluating the effect of energy subsidies on promoting the development of clean energy. Adopting the real option model, Jeon et al. optimized the financial subsidies for renewable energy and applied the model for photovoltaic (PV) [13]. Brutt et al. linked the PV subsidy with CO2 emissions and examined the cost-effectiveness of renewable subsidies [14]. There are also some works about carbon tax and emissions trading in order to reduce CO2 emissions. For example, Chiu et al. evaluated the effect of emissions trading and carbon tax on energy prices [15]. It has been concluded that carbon tax causes more influence on the energy price compared with emis- sions trading. Although several studies have focused on the carbon tax, energy subsidy and market deregulation, the marketization of NG has not been considered in a market with carbon tax and envi- ronmental subsidy concurrently.
In this study, a game-theoretic model based on a multi-agent system is proposed, in which the real-time-pricing (RTP) is applied to both NG and electricity. The objective is to study the effect of market deregulation, carbon tax and environmental subsidy on the promotion of NGFE and optimize the electricity generation of power producer. Game-theoretic approach has been applied to study the power allocation [16], the optimal operations based on the residential participation level in electricity market [17], and the retail electricity market with high penetration of distributed generation [18] etc. However, the game theory has seldom been used in studying the marketization and the internalization of envi- ronmental externality for NGFE and CFE market which can simu- late the dynamic interactive relationships among different players and give an equilibrium result.
This paper presents an innovative approach in modeling the interaction between the production and demand sides in NGFE market and employs the game-theoretic model using an optimiza- tion technique to calculate the effect of market deregulation, environmental subsidy and carbon tax policy. The main contribu- tions of the study include (1) a simultaneous market deregulation for both NG and electricity is proposed and the generation interaction is investigated dynamically; (2) developing a general game-theoretic model, which can consider the interaction between NG market and electricity market for promoting the share of NGFE in total generation production compared with CFE. Even though this work was originally carried out to promote the consumption of NG in China, the achievements of this work, including the pricing method and the game-theoretic model, could also provide insights and suggestions when promoting the development of other clean energy such as renewable energy in different countries.
The remaining parts of this paper are arranged as follows. The interaction formulation of the players in the game for NGFE market and a game-theoretic optimization model for RTP of NG and elec- tricity market are introduced in Section 2; moreover, the scenario designs and data input are depicted in Section 2; five types of scenarios are presented with numerical results based on a series of real world data in Section 3; sensitivity analysis is proposed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2. Game-theoretic model
In the NGFE sector, the prices of NG and electricity are deter- mined by the interactions among the government, NG supplier and power producer as shown in Fig. 1. Principally, the NG supplier determines the real-time NG price with the objective of maximiz- ing the total revenue. It is the same situation for the power pro- ducer to determine the real-time electricity price. However, the NG price and electricity price are not determined independent with each other. The electricity price is affected by the power pro- duction and the ratio of coal-fired electricity to gas-fired electricity (RCeGe), and consequently, affected by the real-time NG price. Nat- urally, the NG supplier always prefers a high NG price. Neverthe- less, at a high NG price, the power producer intends to reduce the generation from NG to guarantee the profit. The low NG demand will reduce the revenue of the NG supplier. Therefore, there exists a game relation between the power producer and the NG supplier. In the meantime, the government sets the upper and lower boundaries for the prices of both NG and electricity so as to avoid the drastic fluctuation of energy prices. 2.1. Modeling the game relation between the power producer and the NG supplier
The game relation between the power producer and the NG supplier will result in a dynamic balance between NG supply and NG demand according to the real-time NG price and electricity.
2.2. Scenario design, assumptions and data input
In order to study the effect of market deregulation, carbon tax policy and environmental subsidy on NGFE, five scenarios are proposed.
Scenario I. Regulated market without environmental subsidy and carbon tax (NT-R-NS) (reference scenario).
Scenario I is designed based on the current situation that the NG price is fixed at 3.65 RMB/Nm3 [7]. In addition, no environmental subsidy is considered for clean power and no carbon tax is imposed. It is used as the reference scenario, which gives the base- line for comparing different scenarios and understanding the impacts of different factors for the promotion of NGFE.
Scenario II. Deregulated market with no environmental subsidy and carbon tax (NT-D-NS). In this scenario, the NG price is deregulated and thus can vary dynamically through time. However, as depicted in Section 2.1, the government as a regulator restricts the price within a band which is higher than the exploration cost fplower and lower than the regulation price level fpupper. However, similar to the scenario of NT-R-NS (Scenario I), the environmental subsidy and the carbon tax are not considered in this scenario.
Scenario III. Regulated market with carbon tax and no environ- mental subsidy (T-R-NS).
In order to assess the effect of carbon tax quantitatively, in this scenario, it is assumed that a carbon tax rate of 100 RMB/tonne CO2 is imposed on power generation [20]. Whereas, it is the regulated NG price and no environmental subsidy is involved for the clean power.
Scenario IV. Deregulated market with carbon tax and no environ- mental subsidy (T-D-NS).
In this scenario, a deregulation market is investigated. Mean- while, the carbon tax level and environmental subsidy status are similar to Scenario III.
Scenario V. Deregulated market with carbon tax and environ- mental subsidy (T-D-S). To begin with, the carbon tax and regulation situation are iden- tical with the case in Scenario IV. Moreover, the power producer is subsidized to test the environmental subsidy effect.
2.3. Input data and assumptions
In this dynamic analysis, the hourly electricity consumption of one typical day was chosen and the demand curve is shown in Fig. 2.
The electricity demand and the electricity price are diverse for different users. In order to carry on the estimation, the data listed in Table 1 were used, which was obtained by processing the data acquired from National Bureau of Statistics of China [21].
The fuel consumption to produce 1 kW h electricity was calcu- lated based on the data shown in Table 2. The fixed generation cost for CFE and NGFE are fixcoal = 0.1359 RMB/kW h and fixgas = 0.1041
RMB/kWh respectively, which were calculated according to Eqs. (13) and (14) based on the data acquired from International Energy Agency [22]. where R is the payment rate of capital cost per year; y is the lifetime years of unit; CM is the total capital cost of CFE or NGFE during the lifetime years of the unit; CA is the capital cost of the unit per year; CMO is the maintenance and operation cost of CFE or NGFE unit; H is the operation hour of each unit per year.
The electricity price constraint coefficient a was applied by the government for fear that power producer increases the electricity price to a high level leading to the situation that the users’ benefits are impaired. The number 0.35 and 0.5 were tested for a and the result does not show a clear effect on the estimated share of NGFE. Since electricity demand is inelastic, a equal to 0.35 was assumed when for solving the model. Assuming the actual RCeGe nowadays in China has reached the optimal situation, the cost coefficients of electricity demand fluctuation in Eq. (6) can be obtained by setting the target value as the real share of NGFE (3.93%). So lgas = 0.0001 RMB/MW h2 and lcoal = 0.0002 RMB/MW h2.
According to the ex-plant price, NG wellhead price, city gate price and other related manufacturing cost, the lower boundary of NG prices is set as fplower = 1 RMB/Nm3. The upper boundary is set as 3.65 RMB/Nm3 for the scenario analysis, as described in Sec- tion 1. Furthermore, the current coal price is 0.52 RMB/kg [23].
Based on the above data, the NGFE generation can be optimized by employing the game-theoretic model. Solving this game- theoretic model is a mixed complementarity problem and the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used. GAMS is specifically designed for modeling linear, nonlinear and mixed integer optimization problems and lets users concentrate on mod- eling by eliminating the need to think about purely technical machine-specific problems such as address calculations, storage assignments, subroutine linkage, and input–output and flow con- trol [24]. 3. Scenario analysis
In the present study, the proposed model was applied for a case study based on the data shown in Fig. 2. The model was applied for each scenario. In order to satisfy the end-users’ electricity demand and to maximize the profit simultaneously, the optimal genera- tions of NGFE and CFE were illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 for different scenarios.
In the reference scenario of NT-R-NS (Scenario I), the generation of CFE is much more than NGFE and NGFE is mainly preferred in peak period, which corresponds to the current state of China. Both The deregulation of NG price (NT-D-NS, Scenario II) and the intro- duction of carbon tax (T-R-NS, Scenario III) can augment the production of NGFE; while comparatively, the deregulation shows a more significant impact on the NGFE production. When the sub- sidy is awarded to the clean energy, the production of NGFE is fur- ther increased. When the NG market is deregulated, the share of NGFE increases much more in a carbon tax-imposed market (Scenario IV).
The share of NGFE for the five scenarios are shown in Table 3.
Compared with reference scenario NT-R-NS (Scenario I) and scenario of NT-D-NS (Scenario II), the NG supplier benefits from the carbon tax policy under scenario of T-D-NS (Scenario III), as shown in Fig. 5. It is noteworthy that deregulation causes more influence on the generation of NGFE after the carbon tax is imposed by the government.
The profit of NG supplier increases in a deregulated market. Moreover, the combination of market deregulation and carbon tax of 100 RMB/tonne (Scenario IV) can further increase the gener- ation of NGFE, which would reach 7.66%. When the environmental subsidy of 134.3 RMB/MW h is included, such as Scenario V, NGFE is increased to the highest level, about 15%. 4. Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed in this section to analyze the impact of carbon tax, upper boundary of NG prices and environ- mental subsidy on the share of NGFE in the electricity market.
The NG price in Chongqing (2.84 RMB/Nm3 [6]), which is lower than the price in Beijing (3.65 RMB/Nm3), is used as another price boundary. Meanwhile, it is further assumed that the coal price used for generation also volatiles in proportion to the NG price change so as to decrease the substitution effect.
The influence of carbon tax on the share of NGFE is shown in Fig 6. The share of NGFE varies linearly approximately with carbon tax for two reference price boundaries and there is an inflection at the point when carbon tax equals to 120 RMB/tonne. For one thing, when the carbon tax reaches to the level higher than 120 RMB/ tonne, the share of NGFE is enhanced more quickly with a 10 RMB/tonne increase in carbon tax additionally. For another, under high NG price level, the carbon tax of 190 RMB/tonne is required in order to achieve a goal of 10% share of NGFE. While under middle NG price level, the carbon tax of 78 RMB/tonne can help to achieve a goal of 10% share of NGFE. Moreover, the differ- ence of NGFE shares between the high NG price level and middle NG price level broadens gradually from 2.76RMB/tonne to 3.41 RMB/tonne with the increase of carbon tax.
If the carbon tax is fixed at 100 RMB/tonne, the corresponding share of NGFE under different NG price upper boundaries is shown in Fig. 7. The share of NGFE follows a linear relationship with the increase of upper boundary of NG price. If this upper boundary is set as 2.95 RMB/tonne, the percentage of NGFE could be up to 10% when the carbon tax of 100 RMB/tonne is imposed.
When the government changes the environmental subsidy in a deregulated market with carbon tax (100 RMB/tonne) and NG price upper boundary of 3.65 RMB/Nm3, the share of NGFE reaches to 15%, as the subsidy rises to 134.3 RMB/MW h, as shown in Fig. 8 (Point A). If the upper boundary of NG price is 2.84 RMB/N m3, when the subsidy is 82.7 RMB/MW h, the share of NGFE reaches to 15%, as shown in Fig. 9 (Point B). Therefore, when the same envi- ronmental subsidy is imposed, a higher share of NGFE is adopted under the middle upper boundary of NG price. On the other hand, the government can award less environmental subsidy to achieve the same level of NGFE share compared to high upper boundary of NG price level.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, the impacts of price reforming in NG and electricity markets on the promotion of NGFE were studied using a developed dynamic game-theoretic model. Scenarios with differ- ent pricing mechanisms, carbon tax and environmental subsidy were analyzed. The obtained results show that the competitiveness of NGFE can be enhanced greatly through the price reforming with the help of carbon tax and environmental subsidy. The deregula- tion of NG market, which allows the price varies in the range of 1 RMB/Nm3 to 3.65 RMB/Nm3, can increase the share of NGFE from 3.93% to 5.49%. With a carbon tax of 100 RMB/tonne, the share of NGFE can be increased to 7.66% in a deregulated market with an upper price boundary of 3.65 RMB/Nm3; and when an environ- mental subsidy of 134.3 RMB/MW h is also considered, the share of NGFE can reach 15%.

35,Sustainability in the Electricity Sector through Advanced Technologies: Energy Mix Transition and Smart Grid Technology in China,"In this paper, we integrate technological, institutional, and financial approaches towards expansion of the smart grid technology. We turn to China as the major producer and consumer of energy with an increasing focus on renewables. China’s electricity market has experienced a number of reforms while trying to address the economic and environmental challenges. In order to identify the basic requirements for the Chinese power sector, we look into the underlying trends of the energy mix, regulatory policies, and financial flows. Understanding these facets allows one to suggest directions for the further development of the Chinese power sector in the light of the smart grid concept. Indeed, the smart grid concept has no strict definition and, therefore, requires simultaneous consideration of multiple factors. The analysis shows that ensuring smooth transfer of electricity across the regions is a quintessential condition for smart grid development and the promotion of renewable energy in China. As the role of the state-owned enterprises still remains the most important one in the sector, private initiatives should be supported. Therefore, financial incentives are needed to guide the shifts in the energy mix and maintain efficient energy generation and consumption in China.","The goals of sustainability have been becoming more and more important across different economic activities and geographic locations [1–4]. China has emerged as the world’s largest primary energy consumer and greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter [5–8]. Given the importance of the Chinese energy sector, the reforms taking place there are likely to have considerable impacts on the trends in energy generation and consumption, economic activities, and the associated environmental pressures. Therefore, there is a need to analyse the performance of the Chinese power sector and identify the main shifts in policies shaping decisions on development thereof. Such an analysis might be helpful in identifying the major achievements and guidelines for further development in the sector.
There have been several major factors shaping the policy regarding energy sector in China. Domestically, economic growth and urbanization have appeared as important drivers for growing energy demand China [9]. Moreover, regulatory reforms have taken place in China [10–12] as well as in many other countries [13]. Internationally, concerns about climate change have resulted in the adoption of a number of international initiatives on the mitigation of GHG emissions. For instance, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol, Copenhagen Accord, Cancún Agreements, and Paris Agreement are notable instances of initiatives towards climate change mitigation. Furthermore, economic research has been initiated to model underlying trends in the economy-energy-environment context [14]. Since the economic reforms of the early 1980s, China has seen remarkable economic growth. Indeed, the annual growth rate of 9% has been maintained for the GDP due to both increasing amounts of inputs and gains in the total factor productivity [15]. Economic structure is also an important facet of energy demand [16]. Among the factor inputs, energy plays an important role, especially in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, economic growth has been related to increasing energy use in China. British Petroleum [17] reported that China and the United States (USA) consumed 23% and 17.8% of global energy consumption. As regards energy-related CO2 emissions, China emitted 9135 million tons CO2, whereas the USA emitted 5176 million tons CO2 in 2014 [18]. These volumes correspond to 28.2% and 16.2% of the global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, respectively. Therefore, the energy mix in China, still dominated by fossil fuels, highlights the difference in the global shares of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This implies a need for further improvements in energy transformation in order to adhere to the goals of sustainability and climate change mitigation.
Urbanization has emerged as an important factor shaping energy demand and transformation in China. Furthermore, these issues have been linked to GHG emissions [15,19–21]. For instance, the five largest cities in China (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou) have reached a population of over 99 million (i.e., over 7% of the total population of China), whereas the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) generated there exceeded 14% of the China’s total GDP, as of 2011 [20]. These figures confirm the importance of the major urban areas in China, as labour productivity in these areas appears to be twice as high as that in the rest of the country. In general, the expansion of cities is evident in terms of growing population, land use, and economic activity. The infrastructure of the urban areas impacts the energy transformation and demand. Therefore, adaptation of the urban energy infrastructure to the needs of the contemporary economy and climate change mitigation goals is an important task for both local and central governments. Private economic agents can also benefit by exploiting more energy-efficient low-carbon technologies.
Following the international trends and practice in electricity power market liberalization, China has also started reforms that seek to delineate state and state and business functions [10] on the one hand and introduce competition in the generation and sales business [11] on the other hand. Following the economic reforms under the opening-up policy, China faced a shortage of electricity. As a result, corporate and foreign entities were allowed to invest in the power generation sector in 1985. This allowed for raising capital and commissioning new power plants. In 2002, the generation of power was opened up to competition between five newly established generation companies and two transmission companies. The competition in the Chinese electricity market was further deepened in 2015 by instituting power market facilities, furthering price deregulation and stressing the priority of switching to renewable energy sources [12]. These changes affect electricity pricing, which, in turn, impacts the behaviour of both residents and business entities. Recently, Ming et al. [22] noted that there has been overcapacity in the coal-fired power plant industry. These findings demand further research into streamlining the power generation sector in China.
In spite of the tremendous increase in the installed capacity of renewable electricity, China mainly relies on coal and hydro energy [11,23]. Indeed, a similar pattern is likely to persist in the near future as well. Specifically, Ngan (2010) reported that the installed capacity of coal-fired power plants was 325 GW as of 2004, with an expected increase up to 360 GW in 2020. Hydro power plants ranked second with an installed capacity of 108 GW in 2004 and an expected installed capacity of 246 GW in 2020. Zhou et al. [23] reported estimates of the installed capacities of wind and solar power of 200 GW and 100 GW, respectively, by 2020. The total share of the two energy sources is expected to remain at around 87% in 2020, with the rest of power generation being based on gas, nuclear, and other renewable energy. According to Xu and Chen [10], the loci of energy sources and consumption are distributed in a rather uneven manner across China. For instance, coal resources are mainly located in the north and northwest of China. Turning to the hydro power resources, they are mainly located in western and southwestern China. However, the most economically developed areas are those located in east and central China. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a single electricity market and ultra-high voltage transmission lines in China [24].
As regards climate change considerations, these have been shaping China’s international commitments and policy of development of the power generation sector. Specifically, China agreed to curb the carbon intensity as measured by carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40–45% if compared to the 2005 level. The corresponding goals have been transferred to the 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans (2006–2010 and 2011–2015, respectively). The 11th Five-Year Plan includes targets for a carbon intensity reduction of 20% (2010 compared to 2005), whereas the 12th Five-Year Plan set a further reduction in carbon intensity of 17% along with a reduction in energy consumption of 16% [25]. The use of renewable energy sources—a major means of curbing carbon emissions—has been promoted by adopting the Renewable Energy Law in 2005 as well as rules for the Energy Conservation Dispatch in 2007 [12]. These documents stressed the importance of renewables and assigned them priority in the energy dispatch. These decisions have fuelled the development of renewable energy in China. According to Zhang et al. [26], the share of renewable energy sources other than hydro in China’s energy mix should increase from 8% in 2006 up to 15% in 2020, which corresponds to a twofold increase. Whereas hydro power has long been established as an important energy source in China, solar [27,28], wind [29], and wind-solar [30] energy generation systems still account for a less significant share in the total energy mix in China. Public support for and application of storage technologies, among other factors, increased the rate of growth in the installed capacity of wind and solar power, which exceeded that for power in general [23].
Development of smart grid technology can alleviate a number of economic and ecological issues. As Eid et al. [31] pointed out, smart grids contribute to decarbonisation, reliability, and efficiency in the electricity sector. This can be achieved by ensuring two-way communication between energy users and producers (in contrast to the one-way power flow in conventional grids). Thus, consumers might even become prosumers in a smart grid. The use of information technologies allows planning institutions to impact the behaviour of consumers by means of tailored pricing or support schemes. However, an exact definition of smart grids is not available [32,33] and, what is more, varies within the context of the region of implementation [26]. Smart grid technologies can be applied in power generation, transmission, transformation, distribution, storage, and consumption [33]. Surveys on smart grid development in China have been presented by Yu et al. [33] and Yuan and Hu [5], whereas Zhang et al. [34] and Eid et al. [31] compared China to other countries in terms of the pathways of smart grid development.
Given the rapid pace of development of both the economy and energy infrastructure in China, there is a need to identify the possible benefits of the smart grids for economy and environment. What is more, the development of smart grids (and energy infrastructure in general) requires considerable investments, which are even higher for recent technologies. Thus, the government needs to intervene in the processes of the development of the smart grids in order to ensure proper rates of return, energy security, and climate change mitigation. However, much of the literature has addressed separate facets of the development of the smart grid technology in China without providing an overarching framework. This paper, therefore, addresses the issue of smart grid development trends in China by conducting a survey of the underlying trends in Chinese electricity power generation and discussing the volume and nature of financial measures for development of smart grids in China, along with technological and institutional arrangements.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the main drivers and shifts in electricity generation in China with much emphasis on the renewables. Section 3 presents the changes in the institutional settings of the power sector. Section 4 presents the concept of the smart grids and their implementation in China. Section 5 analyses investments into the power sector in light of the smart grid promotion in China. Finally, Section 6 concludes. 2. Recent Trends in Electricity Generation in China
Globally, the fuel combustion sector (fossil fuel combustion for power generation, transportation, and heating) is the key source of GHG emissions. Furthermore, this is likely to continue in the near future due to economic growth and urbanization. Indeed, the International Energy Outlook 2016 (reference scenario) suggests energy-related CO2 emissions are likely to increase from 32.3 billion metric tons in 2012 up to 35.6 billion metric tons in 2020, with a further upturn to 43.2 billion metric tons in 2040 [26,35], which implies logged rates of growth of 9.7% and 19.3% for 2012–2020 and 2020–2040, respectively. Therefore, energy generation is likely to increase and the associated environmental pressures are likely to increase as well. In this regard, the situation in China deserves much attention.
Liu et al. [28] noticed that China’s non-renewable energy resources (fossil fuels and uranium) are likely to be depleted within 20 to 50 years as the efficiency of the exploitation of the resources thereof is less than 50% at most. These findings call for a transition towards renewable energy sources in China. In any case, the transition towards cleaner energy is required in order to meet the goals of climate change mitigation. However, the situation in rural areas is rather different from the structure of the overall energy mix as these areas use straw, firewood, and coal for 90% of their final energy consumption [28]. Therefore, there are considerable differences in the structure of the energy mix across Chinese regions. Liu et al. [6] have also identified switching from a coal-based energy mix towards one involving renewable energy sources as a vital measure towards achieving a low-carbon economy. Following Yuan et al. [36], electricity consumption is likely to range between 7000 TWh and 11000 TWh in China by 2030, with fossil fuels still dominating the supply. However, Ming et al. [22] noticed that the total electric power consumption stood at 5550 TWh in 2015, the lowest annual rate of growth during the previous 40 years. Zhou et al. [23] compared per capita power consumption in China to the corresponding figures in the developed countries and assumed it should increase up to 7550 kWh in 2050.
In China, the share of primary energy consumed by the power generation sector went up from 20.6% in 1980 up to 39% in 2010 [33]. The consumption of electricity and power generation capacities have also been increasing in China. This indicates a need for streamlining the processes of development and aligning them to the requirements of climate change mitigation policies. Coal-fired and hydro power plants dominate the electricity generation sector in China. Zhang et al. (2017) reported that the primary energy supply increased from 627.7 million tce up to 3600 million tce (i.e., more than five-fold) in China during 1978–2014. The share of the crude oil in the primary energy structure continued declining, with the absolute amount being more or less fixed during the said period. As a result, power generation from renewable energy sources has gained momentum in 2005 and increased by 3-fold during 2005–2013 (from 401.7 billion kWh up to 1101 billion kWh). The generation capacity has also seen a sharp increase in China (from 66 GW up to 1360 GW during 1980-2014), thus reaching a per-capita supply rate of 1 kW [36]. The data provided by Yuan et al. [36] also suggest that the share of thermal power in the capacity mix is lower than its share in the fuel mix (68% and 75% for 2014, respectively). The total electricity consumption increased by 18-fold with a varying rate of growth: 1980–2000 saw an increase of 8% p.a., whereas a higher rate of 12% p.a. was observed for 2000–2010 [36]. The subsequent period experienced an increasing extent of decoupling (e.g., electricity consumption increased by 3.8% along with an increase in GDP of 7.4% during 2014) as the economic structure and activity level have changed. Yuan et al. [36] noted that electricity consumption by households has been increasing in China (12.5% of the total electricity consumption in China as of 2014).
2.1. Thermal Power
Coal appears as the main energy source in China. More specifically, coal accounted for more than 60% of the primary energy consumption in China as of 2016, with an even higher share prior to that year [30,37]. The capacity of thermal power plants has been expanding and, eventually, amidst the decrease in electricity consumption in 2015, overcapacity has occurred [22]. This process can be attributed to institutional and economic factors. Specifically, deregulation of the electricity generation sector meant that the right to commission thermal power plants has been transferred from the central government to local governments. Economically, low prices of carbon implied high returns on equity for thermal power plants (even after adjustments of feed-in tariffs). Ming et al. [22] noted that the annual growth rate in Chinese thermal power plant capacity reached 7.8%, whereas demand went up by just 0.5% as of 2015. Consequently, utilization hours have been declining in China since 2011, when they exceeded 5000 h, and reached 4329 h in 2015—the lowest value since 1969. During 2010–2015, investments into thermal power plants amounted to 92.16–144.16 billion RMB each year, resulting in a newly added capacity of 34.5–63.68 GW [22]. Yuan et al. [36] noted that the average capacity of the newly installed thermal power plants has increased recently. For instance, thermal power plants with a capacity of less than 300 MW constituted more than 70% of the total thermal power plant capacity in China, while this share dropped to 25% in 2012. Such an increase in the average thermal power plant capacity has led to overcapacity on the one hand and increase in efficiency on the other hand. As regards the efficiency of energy transformation, Yuan et al. [36] reported a decrease in the heat rate of power supply from 470 gce/kWh in 1980 down to 392 gce/kWh in 2000 and, finally, down to 318 gce/kWh in 2014. However, certain regional disparities continue to persist in Chinese thermal power generation.
Mou [24] carried out an efficiency analysis of thermal power plants in China by compiling the data for 2009–2011. Thermal power plants in the six power grids in China have been compared; the results suggested that Dongbei (Northeast) grid (Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces) was the least efficient, whereas Huadong (East China) grid (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces) appeared to be the most efficient. The operation of thermal power plants in China has also caused severe air pollution (haze). It was reported by Yuan et al. [36] that the Chinese power industry is responsible for 23% of national particle material emissions, 45% of SO2 emissions, 64% of NOx emissions, and 44% of CO2 emissions. Therefore, energy planning needs to be improved to ensure the economic, technical, and environmental efficiency of the thermal power plants in China.
There have also been differences in the newly added capacities, total installed capacities, and power generation across the Chinese provinces [22]. As regards the newly installed capacity, Henan, Anhui, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Shanxi were the five provinces where it exceeded 5 GW in 2015. Indeed, these five provinces accounted for 45% of the total increase in the installed capacity of the thermal power plants. The distribution of the installed capacity depends on both the sources of energy (coal) and the concentration of the demand for power [22]. Accordingly, the installed capacity of the thermal power plants exceeded 50 GW in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, Henan, and Shanxi. The spatial distribution of the electricity power generation basically corresponds to that of the installed capacity. However, only eight provinces showed an increase in thermal power generation in 2015 [22].
2.2. Hydropower
Hydropower is the second most important component in the energy mix in China. According to China’s Medium- and Long-term Development Plan for Renewable Energy, adopted in 2007, the share of hydropower and other renewables should be further increased in the energy mix. Li et al. [38] noted that China lags behind the developed countries in terms of the utilization of the hydropower resources: the average level of exploitation has reached 60%, whereas China exploits 46% of the hydropower resources. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in the level of hydropower exploitation in China. As Li et al. [39] argued, hydropower plants are multifunctional facilities as they contribute to irrigation and flood control, thereby improving transportation and contributing to economic growth. However, the operation of large hydropower stations might affect local ecosystems and becomes problematic during the rainy season as excessive electricity generated is wasted.
Li et al. [38] and Zhang et al. [26] reported a theoretical hydropower potential in China of 694 GW. Technically, feasible installed capacity equals 542 GW, with an annual generation of 2470 TWh per year. As regards the economically feasible installed capacity and annual generation, these are 402 GW and 1750 TWh per year, respectively. Li et al. [39] showed that there are differences in the regional hydropower endowments and a further differentiation in terms of technically and economically feasible generation volumes. For instance, southwest China possesses the largest hydropower resources and its theoretical generation accounts for 70.6% of the national theoretical annual generation, yet the corresponding economically feasible share is 58.9%. At the other end of the spectrum, central China possesses a theoretical generation contributing to 5.1% of the national annual generation, whereas its economically feasible generation comprises 12.3% of the national economically feasible generation. Note that these figures are relative to the absolute generation capacities (which are either technically or economically feasible) and reflect the underlying average generation costs in their essence.
The installed capacity of the hydropower plants increased from 79 GW in 2000 to 320 GW in 2015 [39]. The generation of hydropower went from 397 billion kWh in 2005 to 911.6 billion kWh in 2013 [26]. As of 2014, hydropower accounted for 22.25% of the total electricity generated and 22.24% of the total installed capacity [26].
The installation of hydropower plants faces a number of obstacles as they not only bring benefits, but might also affect the environment and even require resettlement. Furthermore, the slow pace of development of the hydropower projects encourages thermal power plants to expand and meet the demand for power in China. As most of China’s hydropower resources are located in the southwest, there is an imbalance between power generation and demand there. In order to reduce the amount of unused power, grids need to be more integrated and, in particular, hydro pumped power storage (HPPS) plants need to be constructed [39]. The 13th Five-Year Plan projects an increase in the installed capacity of the HPPS plants up to 400 GW in 2020 [39]. These issues also demonstrate the need for improvements in power generation and transmission in China.
2.3. Wind Electricity
Wind energy is an important renewable energy source in China [40]. Zhang et al. [26] reported that the exploitable capacity of onshore and offshore wind power is 600–1000 GW and 400–500 GW, respectively. Liu and Wang [30] argued that 50% of the territory of China features a wind energy density of 150–50 W/m2, whereas 26% of the area shows higher values. Development of the wind power plants has accelerated since the introduction of the Renewable Energy Law in 2005 and the subsequent setting up of feed-in tariffs. More specifically, the installed capacity of wind power plants was just 224 MW in 1998 and increased to 764 MW in 2004 [30]. However, the installed capacity increased to 1266 MW in 2005 and further to more than 110 GW in 2014 [26]. Zhang et al. [26] also noted that China was ranked first in the world according to the newly installed capacity of wind power plants. Wind power generation went from 1.9 TWh in 2005 to 131.9 TWh in 2013 [26]. Hong et al. [41] reported a capacity factor for wind power of 21.7% for China as opposed to 31.8% for the United States.
Hong et al. [41] reported that there have been several stages in the regulation of wind electricity prices. Before 2003, the power purchase agreements between wind electricity producers and governments set up the purchase prices. During 2003–2008, the wind concession program was in action. In the latter case, tendering was applied with bidding prices set for the first 30,000 full load hours of a wind power plant and local power tariffs applies afterwards. However, the bidding process created extremely low wind electricity prices, which curbed the development of wind power. Finally, regional feed-in tariffs were set up in 2009.
However, the distribution of wind power plants is uneven and does not correspond to the patterns of electricity demand as many of the wind power plants are located in northern China (Inner Mongolia and Gansu provinces), which, indeed, is less developed economically. The share of on-grid wind power plant capacity needs to be increased in China [41]. The failures of the transmission system caused the loss of some 10 TWh of the wind electricity (i.e., 12% of the total generation in the analysed regions) in 2011 [41]. Yu et al. [42] also stressed the issue of wind energy curtailment in the context of ongoing reforms in the Chinese electricity market. Therefore, the growth in the installed capacity of the wind power plants offers a promising perspective for an increase in the production of the renewable energy, yet electricity grids need to be developed in order to ensure transmission of the wind power across China.
2.4. Solar Electricity
Solar energy has been used for power generation, water heating, and infrastructure (lighting) in China [30]. Indeed, solar energy has been underutilized in China prior to the establishment of feed-in tariffs for solar electricity in 2011 [41]. Liu and Wang [30] reported that China possessed 63.1% of the world’s total solar water heating capacity in 2005.
Liu and Wang [30], Liu et al. [28], and Liu and Chu [43] discussed the spatial differences in solar energy availability across different regions of China. China comprises a total area of some 9.6 million km2 and 67% of the area is suitable for the operation of solar power plants (more than 2200 h of sunshine and irradiance of more than 5000 MJ/m2 per year). Following Zhang et al. [35], the highest solar irradiance is observed in the Tibetan plateau (irradiance of more than 1750 kWh/m2 per year).
As already mentioned, momentum for the development of the solar electricity sector increased in 2011. Accordingly, the installed capacity of the solar power plants was just 140 MW in 2008 and went up to 43 GW in 2015 [35]. As regards the generation of solar electricity, it stood below 1 billion kWh until 2011 and reached 11.9 billion kWh in 2013. The data from the International Renewable Energy Agency [44] suggest that the installed capacity of solar generation further increased to 130 GW in 2017. Therefore, there has been a robust increase in both capacity and generation due to policy reforms associated with the solar power sector. Hong et al. [41] reported the capacity factor for solar energy was 14.8% in China (as compared to 24% in the United States).
As was the case with the wind power generation, increasing integration of solar power plants into the electricity grids is required to satisfy the objectives associated with energy demand and sustainability. What is more, solar power needs to be combined with other energy sources in certain instances. Liu and Wang [30] stressed the need for applying combined solar-wind systems for road lighting and irrigation.

35,Sustainability in the Electricity Sector through Advanced Technologies: Energy Mix Transition and Smart Grid Technology in China,"In this paper, we integrate technological, institutional, and financial approaches towards expansion of the smart grid technology. We turn to China as the major producer and consumer of energy with an increasing focus on renewables. China’s electricity market has experienced a number of reforms while trying to address the economic and environmental challenges. In order to identify the basic requirements for the Chinese power sector, we look into the underlying trends of the energy mix, regulatory policies, and financial flows. Understanding these facets allows one to suggest directions for the further development of the Chinese power sector in the light of the smart grid concept. Indeed, the smart grid concept has no strict definition and, therefore, requires simultaneous consideration of multiple factors. The analysis shows that ensuring smooth transfer of electricity across the regions is a quintessential condition for smart grid development and the promotion of renewable energy in China. As the role of the state-owned enterprises still remains the most important one in the sector, private initiatives should be supported. Therefore, financial incentives are needed to guide the shifts in the energy mix and maintain efficient energy generation and consumption in China.","2.5. Biomass Power
Biomass sector has great potential in China as agricultural residues and municipal waste are available in large quantities there. Zhang et al. [35] identified four general options for biomass-based power generation in China: (i) direct combustion; (ii) gasification power generation (including direct gasification power and gasification combined cycle generation); (iii) biomass-coal co-firing generation (including biomass-coal direct combustion generation and biomass-coal co-gasification generation); and (iv) biogas power generation.
Biomass power generation has great potential in China as the agricultural sector can provide substantial amounts of residues that serve as a source of primary energy. Zhang et al. [35] reported that agricultural residues can provide energy equal to some 440 million tce per annum. Another 28 million tce can be obtained annually by utilizing manure. Forest residues is another important source of input for the biomass power sector which, in China, comprises some 350 tce per year. The potential contribution of the municipal waste is 12 million tce per year.
The installed capacity of the biomass power plants grew from 2500 MW up to 7800 MW in China during 2006–2013 [45]. However, a decrease in newly installed capacity has been observed since 2011 [35]. Liu et al. [46] and Lin and He [45] summarized the support measures for the biomass sector in China. These include price support via the feed-in tariffs, tax reductions, connection fee subsidies, and financial measures. The feed-in tariff for biomass sector was available during 2006–2010. Contrary to the situation in regards to other types of energy, the biomass power sector in China shows a higher share of private investment [45].
Hong et al. [41] reported that the biomass capacity factor in China (74.2%) is higher than that in the USA (64.6%). In this regard, only nuclear power is superior to biomass power in China. Similar findings are reported by Lin and He [45], considering the average equivalent full load operating hours. Lin and He [45] noted that the rate of growth in the installed capacity of the biomass power plants lags behind those of other renewables. Therefore, the biomass sector in China still requires attention in order to fully exploit its potential and contribute towards the implementation of China’s commitments towards climate change mitigation.
China has great potential for improving its energy mix in the sense of commitment to reductions in GHG emissions. However, the spatial discrepancies between energy supply and demand require development of the electricity grid. Such development can be guided by the government through regulation of the feed-in tariffs [9] and other means of support.
2.6. Nuclear Power
Nuclear power plants are mainly located in coastal regions in China due to a lack of other energy sources there [47]. There have been several stages in the development of nuclear energy in China, which marked the expansion of the installed capacities. As a result, the share of nuclear electricity in the total electricity production fluctuated slightly above 1% during 1997–2002, stayed around 2% during 2003–2012, and gained momentum afterwards, peaking at 3.56% in 2016 [48]. Therefore, nuclear energy has recently been promoted as a clean energy type in China and saw an increase in the installed capacity as well as in the share of the total electricity production.
3. Electricity Market Reform in China
Similar to the trends prevailing across the world, China has sought to both increase competition in the electricity market and switch to cleaner electricity. The legal, economic, and technical issues underlying the electricity reform in China were discussed by Xu and Chen [10], Ngan [11], and Li et al. [49]. Ma [9] and Zhang et al. [26] focused on issues of renewable energy in the latter context.
There can be several phases of electricity market reform outlined in China. During the state monopoly stage (1949–1985), the central government was responsible for both the regulation and operation of the power sector. The second stage (1985–1997) saw a partial deregulation, allowing investors to enter the power generation. The third stage (1997–2002) meant separation of regulation and production functions in regards to the government. During the fourth stage (2002–2013), the state monopoly was disintegrated by restructuring the State Power Corporation. Since 2014, the policy has been aiming at eradication of the “relative monopoly,” i.e., ensuring more competition in the generation and retail activities.
The period 1949–1985 marked the absolute domination of the central government in the power sector. Indeed, the government was responsible for both the planning and the operations of the power sector. Ma [9] termed this situation the dual role of the government. The central government would pass certain duties to the regional government, where the same duality persisted. Therefore, the development of the power sector was completely dependent on the decisions taken by the government agencies. As the government controlled all the elements of the power supply chain (i.e., the complete vertical integration was maintained), no serious measures for on-grid tariff regulation were taken [9]. As a result, electricity prices remained rather stable during 1949–1985. This impeded efficient resource allocation to a certain extent. As a result, a shortage of investments in the power sector occurred [10]. The enduring underinvestment led to electricity shortages, which, in turn, threatened economic growth in general. On the other hand, the implementation of opening-up policies fueled economic growth and a demand for power. Such a situation triggered the need for investment-oriented reforms in the power sector.
During 1985–1997, the government remained the key player in the power sector, yet investors were allowed to enter the sector too. This was basically an attempt to create conditions for private (both domestic and foreign) investments and regional-level initiatives. In order to secure the pay-off of the investments, the on-grid tariffs had to be adjusted. The turning point was the adoption of the Provisional Regulations on promoting Fundraising for Investment in the Power Sector and Implementing Different Power prices by the State Council in 1985. Basically, business operations were no longer solely under the control of the Chinese government as independent power producers (IPP) were allowed to enter the market (specifically, they were granted access to the grid and allowed to supply the electricity at the adjusted tariffs). This had to be in parallel with shifts in regulatory policies [10]. In 1987, the Guidance for the Implementation of Multiple On-Grid Tariffs was jointly adopted by several government agencies. These guidelines allowed for 12–15% rates of return [9]. Such a setting allowed for construction of new power plants, but did not guarantee allocation efficiency. In any case, the power shortage ceased to exist in 1997. The interests of the government-run vertical electricity power monopoly clashed with those of the new IPPs. As a result, power trade at the interprovincial level was rather complicated. What is more, the application of the adjusted electricity tariffs led to serious increases in electricity prices.
The Chinese government sought to separate the administrative and business operation activities during 1997-2002. These reforms were mainly implemented by establishing the State Power Corporation to carry out business activities and the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State Development planning Commission. The Electric Power Law of the People’s Republic of China of 1995 (effective since 1996) marked an initial stage of the policy, setting reasonable electricity tariffs and performing regulation of the power sector in general. Several provinces attempted to dissolve the vertical monopoly [10]. The power price was related to interest payments over a certain period of operation and thus offered a more fair treatment of different types of investors. The newly established State Power Corporation still controlled more than 50% of the power generation assets along with power transmission, distribution, and sales. Such a situation caused certain difficulties in spite of the progress achieved due to institutional end economic reforms. Indeed, the government remained the main administrator of the power sector. This implied a lack of competition and, therefore, lower efficiency [10]. In addition, cross-provincial transmission and effective investment incentives remained issues to be tackled. The aforementioned shortcomings and failures required decisions regarding the further modernization of the Chinese power sector.
The subsequent dismantling of the state electricity sector monopoly took place in 2002–2013. The State Council issued a Plan of Reform of the Power Industry (so-called Document No. 5). As Xu and Chen [10] reported, the State Power Corporation controlled 46% of the total installed capacity in China, along with 90% of the transmission assets. The aforementioned shortcomings of the Chinese electricity market were to be tackled by further breaking down the State Power Corporation into three parts: (i) generation assets were distributed among the five companies (“the big five”); (ii) transmission and distribution assets were shared between the two companies (State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid); and (iii) the four service companies [49]. In this way, the vertical monopoly was eliminated. Most importantly, the separation of generation and transmission was ensured. The State Electric Regulatory Commission has been instituted to oversee the power sector in China. In general, the reforms carried out in 2002 can be summarized under the three goals of restructuring, regulation, and competition [10]. However, the dismantling of the State Power Corporation still left the government with decision-making power regarding the operations of the power sector. Li et al. [49] noted that “the big five” companies managed to increase the share of the total installed capacity in China under their control during 2003–2010 in spite of the reforms aimed at attracting new investors and de-monopolization. Therefore, the state-owned companies controlled some 60% of the national installed capacity as of 2010 [50]. This situation was termed a relative monopoly [50]. Turning to the retail operations, the Chinese power sector still maintained a single-buyer model. In particular, the government was responsible for setting on-grid tariffs and retail prices, besides being the owner of many of the generation assets. Such a situation increased the importance of the government in the power sector, which was contradictory to the goals of de-monopolization. The next round of reforms aimed to tackle these shortcomings.
The period starting in 2014 can be described as focusing on breaking the relative monopoly [49]. Reforms pertaining to the most recent period have gained momentum in 2015 as the Several Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Further Deepening the Reform of the Electric Power System (Document No. 9) was released. A thorough survey of the recent policy developments has been prepared by Pollitt et al. [51]. The following goals of the reforms can be identified in Document No. 9 [51]: (i) improving power pricing, (ii) establishing effective power trading systems, (iii) improving power generation, (iv) creating institutions for electricity trading, (v) improving power distribution and sales, (vi) ensuring access to grid, and (vii) improving power planning. There are three stages of the most recent reform stipulated by Document No. 9 [42]. First, large customers can access the grid. In the second stage, retail electricity market allows all the users to buy power from independent companies. The third stage involves the so-called energy Internet, whereby electricity consumers are allowed to interact with the electricity grid and combine the use of electricity with other sources of energy. Besides market-oriented incentives, the government should foster such technologies as energy storage and conversion in this stage. Shenzhen was the first city to implement the competitive retail electricity market with separation of generation and retail from transmission and distribution functions. As a result, the transmission-distribution and retail prices went down there [51].
Keeping the structure of a fuel mix fixed, an increase in energy consumption leads to proportional increase in energy-related GHG emissions. Jia et al. [52] carried out pinch analysis for optimization of Chinese energy mix and suggested that a transition from a coal-based energy mix should take place in order to meet the carbon reduction targets for 2020 and 2050. Amidst the power market reforms, environmental concerns have emerged. In particular, the Renewable Energy Law adopted in 2005 stressed the importance of renewables and clean energy. The Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy was adopted in 2007 with targets for different sources of energy. Note that the targets for wind energy were met rapidly. Later on, the Circular Economy Promotion Law of 2009 contributed to the exploitation of the biomass energy. In order to promote the use of renewables, the Renewable Energy Law Amendments of 2009 envisaged a corresponding quota. Furthermore, the Energy Conservation Dispatch was introduced in 2007 [12]. The highest priority in terms of the energy dispatch was given to renewable energy sources (with intermittent ones placed ahead of non-intermittent ones), with nuclear power plants coming next. Cogeneration plants and coal-fired plants with improvements regarding by-product abatement, gas turbines, and coal-gasification power plants were also assigned priority over conventional coal-fired power plants. The coal-fired power plants were further prioritized in regard to their heat rates and emission levels.
The overview of the development of the electricity market in China suggests several implications. First, the basic needs of securing the substantial electricity supply have been successfully achieved by means of the market-oriented measures in China. Second, dismantling government-owned companies has led to only a limited competitive market. Thirdly, environmental concerns have been shaping the Chinese power sector recently.
4. Smart Grids in China
Moretti et al. [32] noted that most of the prevailing electricity networks were constructed in the 20th century. The radial electricity flow is the underpinning principle of these networks. What is more, power generation is mainly based on fossil fuels or nuclear energy. Economic growth and imbalances in the spatial distribution of energy sources and energy demand renders congestion and, thus, blackouts. Therefore, the current requirements of sustainable development are in conflict with the existing electricity network structures. Smart grids have been proposed as an alternative to the existing network concept, allowing for increased use of renewables and interactions between the grid and consumers.
The very definition of a smart grid cannot be given explicitly. However, certain basic properties delineating smart grids from the concept of the conventional electricity network can be outlined. First, a smart grid allows for two-way communication in the grid, i.e., consumers may return information and/or electricity to the grid in addition to the conventional consumption of electricity [31]. Second, a more flexible pricing system may be developed to manage the electricity demand. In this regard, the use of smart meters is particularly important [31,53]. From an economic point of view, consumer independence is also important (however, this is not a distinctive feature of the smart grid). Moretti et al. [32] summarized the properties of the smart grids in the following manner: (i) streamlining power generation; (ii) curbing transmission and distribution loss; (iii) ensuring rapid damage control; and (iv) allowing for off-grid energy sources (e.g., renewables). Zhang et al. [34] proposed the following attributes of the smart grids: compatibility (supporting all means of generation); flexibility (dynamic power resources in line with improved infrastructures); efficiency (improved technologies allow for better resource management and operation efficiency); serviceability (new services and products); safety (resilience and improved reliability; self-repair); and interoperability (smart metering, information technologies).
As Eid et al. [31] put it, smart grids essentially aim at the “decarbonisation, reliability, and (economic) efficiency” of the power sector. As one can see, these aims correspond to the environmental challenges imposed by the sustainable development objectives and energy retail economic growth through installation of smart technologies and extension of the energy mix. The real-time operation of smart technologies ensures that interactive operation of the grid may be achieved. Anyway, the conventional grids also feature certain technologies related to the smart grids, e.g., sensor and control systems in the high-voltage systems [31]. Yu et al. [33] provided an even greater number of options for contrasting the traditional and smart grids.
Smart grids are related to the institutional arrangement of the power sector. Basically, the power sector can act as a vertically integrated monopoly at one end of the spectrum and as a retail competition at the other end of the spectrum. These arrangements imply the peculiarities of implementation of the smart grids, first of all by differences in the possible tariff setting. The cases of a single buyer and multiple ones fall in between these extreme situations.
As Eid et al. [31] noted, both capital investments and operational expenses may increase in case of smart grid development under vertical integration. In this case, the regulating authority should acknowledge the corresponding capital investments as the appropriate ones in order to ensure the development of smart grids. However, the price of the electricity is not competitively set under the vertical monopoly and interactive technologies might not be properly perceived by the consumers. This, indeed, might reduce the spread of innovations.
Similar reasoning applies to situation where distribution service operators are established in order to allow for retail choice. These entities should be allowed to invest in smart grids without being affected in the incentive regulation process. Otherwise, the development of smart grids might also be dampened as the installation and operation costs may increase [31]. In case generation and distribution companies are completely unbundled, the effects of the smart grids upon each actor need to be determined.
In the case of complete competition, retailers can definitely benefit from the development of smart grids. As Eid et al. [31] argue, insights into consumption patterns and price elasticity allow retailers to develop proper solutions for both supply and demand management of the electricity. Therefore, no specific incentives for smart grids (as far as they are related to the retail activities) are needed in this case.
Energy service companies can also emerge under the presence of smart grids. These companies allow for aggregating different services (electricity, heating, etc.). By doing this, they enhance the flexibility of the grid. As regards consumers, they face differences in their consumption due to dynamic pricing and similar instruments. Indeed, they can decide on the consumption and production of electricity given the prices. Real-time information about the energy system allows them to make decisions regarding the consumption and production of electricity under specific conditions at a certain time. This further affects the energy costs and emissions.
In spite of the reforms discussed in Section 3, China basically follows the virtual integration model as the largest share of generation, transmission, and distribution activities is controlled by state-owned companies. The rate of return principle is followed for regulatory purposes. Therefore, the incentive to develop smart grids lies with the government in general. As Zhang et al. [34] pointed out, residential electricity consumption is relatively low in China (some 15% of the total electricity consumption in 2014) compared to the developed countries. Another feature of the Chinese electricity network is the need for long-distance transmission lines (see Section 2) due to discrepancies among energy sources and demand spots. Taking the institutional approach, the power grid is centrally controlled in China [34]. These circumstances have shaped the direction and extent of implementation of smart grid technologies in China.
In China, the two grid companies—State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid—control the transmission and distribution as well as much of the retail. These companies are exclusive in terms of their areas of service and, thus, face no competition. State Grid Corporation of China, indeed, is much larger (it serves 26 provinces) and is the major supporter of smart grid development in China.
Yu et al. [33] reported that the State Grid Corporation of China supported pilot projects covering different parts of the electricity network (transmission, distribution, consumption, electric vehicles, etc.). Generation is also covered by smart grid projects [31], with a particular interest in including renewables in the energy mix. In order to integrate remote sources of energy into the grid, ultra-high voltage lines are being developed. However, appliances such as smart meters are not given priority when sketching smart grid projects in China. Therefore, dynamic pricing also remains an important issue for future research.
Yuan and Hu [5] also identified the need for ensuring both the supply-side and the demand-side efficiency of the grid. A grid comprising optimization of both supply-side and demand-side improvements has been termed a super smart grid. Whereas the supply-side improvements have been discussed above, demand-side improvements involve feedback technologies, smart buildings, electric vehicle charging technologies, etc. [5].
Electricity pricing provides the major means for adjusting the energy mix on the supply side and improves the energy efficiency on the demand side. Smart grids provide more opportunities for real-time pricing and, thus, further gains in efficiency. Menezes and Zheng [54] provided a survey of the power pricing in China. Generation prices generally rely on the decisions of the National Development and Reform Commission as the direct sales to end-users remain meager. Transmission and distribution prices are calculated residually, yet a cost-plus-return principle should be implemented in the future. The retail pricing in China differentiates between the residential, agricultural, and industrial sectors, with the former two sectors receiving lower-than-average prices. In general, cross-subsidizing prevails in China, with the residential sector being subsidized [54,55].
The residential sector is subject to the three-tiered electricity pricing adopted in 2012 [55]. The voltage and time of use determine the electricity price for the residential users. The industrial users are also subject to electricity price differentiation depending on the energy efficiency [54]. Sun [56] argues that the residential pricing system can be further improved by increasing consumer awareness and adjusting the policies to different groups of consumers. The use of the smart grids may contribute to shaping the pricing of the electricity by implementing real-time (dynamic) pricing. Wang et al. [57] presented a simulation that indicated possible gains from real-time pricing in China. The examples of dynamic pricing for China’s case were presented by, e.g., He and Zhang [58] and Ma et al. [59]. The adjustments in pricing and implementation of smart grids (including support schemes) can be made by considering the demand response functions involving inefficiency term, as suggested by Broadstock et al. [60].
A crucial element of the effective smart grids is distributed energy storage. This technology requires both technological and economic arrangements. Zheng et al. [61] developed the concept of coordinated energy storage dispatch for distributed units. Milis et al. [62] discussed the issues of the capacity tariff setting. Wu and Lin [63] and Yang and Zhao [64] showed that the distributed energy storage can improve the reliability and profitability of the smart grid in China. The strategy for the development of the Chinese power sector post-2014 basically corresponds to the concept of the smart grid. The centralized control of the electricity sector in China implies both benefits and drawbacks. Currently, smart grid development in China focuses on large-scale projects without serious consideration of consumer-side optimization [31,34], yet some applications of, e.g., smart meters have been reported [33]. However, there has been a lack of clear objectives for smart grids in China. Therefore, certain technical barriers persist that imply further operation of a system mainly based on the thermal and hydro power plants. The concentration of the control of the electricity sector, nevertheless, allows for rapid implementation of the smart grid projects [31]. To conclude, identification of clear objectives for the energy policy and inclusion of consumers in decision-making regarding energy consumption and production would allow for the creation of a more advanced electricity sector in China.
5. Financial Investments and Performance of the Electricity Sector in China
The financial aspects of energy sector development in China have been discussed by, e.g., Zhang et al. [26] and Pollitt et al. [51]. In this section, we further discuss the trends in the performance of the Chinese energy sector with a particular focus on investment in electricity generation (production) and supply business. Pollitt et al. [51] reported that many of the investments into the electricity sector were dedicated to distribution activities. Therefore, the development of smart grids in China might be fuelled by these financial flows.
The supply side of the power generation in China is governed by a feed-in tariff system. The resulting feed-in prices for 2013–2017 are given in Table 1. Out of the different energy types, only biomass showed an increasing trend in the feed-in price. The steepest decline is observed for coal power, solar power, and hydro power. However, solar power maintains a much higher average tariff for 2013–2017 (977.11 CNY/MWh) as opposed to, e.g., coal power (392.97 MWh). As regards the demand side, the electricity sales price plays an important role. See Wang et al. [55] for a survey of the residential tiered electricity pricing in China. The average data for China are presented in Table 2. As one can see, the price of electricity for residential users declined at a faster pace (−1.56% p.a.) than the average price (−1.36% p.a.).
The Chinese energy sector has faced changes in the industrial structure that have affected the demand for energy and electricity in particular. As Figure 1 suggests, there had been a slowdown in the growth of the income of electricity generation and supply companies during 2010–2015. In particular, 2015 marked a decrease in income. This can be attributed to decreasing demand by energy-intensive heavy industries (e.g., steel production). Therefore, power generation is becoming a less important problem compared to the development of grid systems. We further look into the sources of investments in fixed assets (Figure 3). A key trend is that the role of the self-raising funds has become more important. Specifically, the share of the investments facilitated by self-raised funds grew from 41.4% in 2004 to 67.3% in 2015. The share of domestic loans decreased from 44.5% to 23.7% during the same time period. Therefore, the latter source lost its position as the primary source of fixed asset investments in production and supply of electricity, heat, gas, and water. The share of investments financed by the state budget increased from 3.8% to 5.6%. The share of foreign investments went down from 3.6% to 0.01%. Therefore, self-raised funds remain the most important source of investment in energy infrastructure. This suggests that the development of smart grids will be closely related to the performance of domestic companies. The investments in electricity generation and grid construction are further analysed in Table 3. Investments in electricity generation are broken down by the energy type. As one can see, the investments in the power supply grid infrastructure tended to increase by 19.65 billion CNY a year on average. The rate of change for investments in the grid infrastructure was higher (23.16 billion CNY a year). Prior to 2012, the volume of investments in the grid infrastructure was lower than that of investments in supply generation, yet the trend has reversed thereafter. This indicates more efforts going into the construction of the grids. The latter situation is favourable in the sense of smart grid development in China. Hydro power and thermal power saw the steepest decrease in investment, whereas wind power exhibited the highest increase. As a result, the structure of investment in the new energy capacity shifted during 2008–2016, with investment in wind energy rising to second place from third. Table 4 presents the dynamics of newly installed capacity for different types of energy. Among the energy types considered, wind and solar power plants showed the highest increase in installed capacity (as indicated by average annual rates of change of 2.1 GW p.a. and 3.4 GW p.a.). Thermal power plants showed the steepest decline in the newly installed capacity of 2 GW p.a. Even though the newly installed capacity of the nuclear power plants increased in both absolute and relative terms, it comprised 6% of the total newly installed capacity in 2016. Note that a surge in nuclear expenses during 2012 was observed during post-Fukushima restrictions. Even though thermal power plants dominated the structure of newly installed capacity, there has been a clear trend of switching to renewables. Specifically, the share of solar power plants in the newly installed capacity increased up to 29% in 2016, putting it in second place among the types of energy covered in the analysis. On the contrary, the share of thermal power plants dropped from 71% to 40%. The share of hydro power plants also declined by some 13 pp.
The dynamics of the investment in different types of energy are partially impacted by the prevailing installation costs. By combining the data in Tables 3 and 4, we obtain the installation costs for different types of energy in CNY per 1 kW (see Table 5 for the resulting costs). The decline in newly installed capacity of hydro power plants can be related to the rather high installation costs of this type of energy. In particular, 2015–2016 marked an increase in the hydro power installation costs, which made it the most expensive energy in this regard. The rate of change for the latter type of energy is also positive, indicating that such a trend is not likely to be reversed in the near future. Thermal power remains the cheapest energy in terms of installation costs, yet thermal power plants are not developed in the first place due to new policies regarding environmental pressures and the promotion of non-fossil energy. Wind power showed the lowest rate of change, indicating the highest reduction in installation price. As it was already mentioned, hydro power became the most expensive energy in terms of the installation costs, which indicates the increased attractiveness of the wind power plants. 6. Conclusions and Policy Implications
In the future, the development of the Chinese energy sector will require us not only to simply address the demand of energy consumers, but also to streamline the planning and operation of the energy sector. This needs to be done with respect to the diverse requirements of economic activities (i.e., changes in the economic structure and its spatial distribution) and global commitments to climate change mitigation. These issues can be successfully addressed by implementing smart grid technology in China. Therefore, the central government should focus on an integrated approach towards the development of smart grid systems by ensuring financial, institutional, and technological guidance.
Looking at the demand side, the Chinese power sector is dominated by industrial consumers. Removal of backward capacity and slowdown of energy-intensive economic activities has pushed the demand for electricity down in the recent years. This implies certain directions for development of smart grids in China. In particular, transmission activities will receive much attention in terms of investments and technological advancement. Transmission is important to address the discrepancies between factor endowments and energy demand centres in China. Without the expansion of smart metering system in China, the dynamic pricing of electricity would not overtake the currently applied rate of return principle.
Smart grids remain important to tackle dynamic patterns of energy demand driven by economic growth and urbanization. The analysis carried out on financial flows showed that investments in electricity generation and grid infrastructure have been steadily increasing in China during 1996–2016, yet the relative share of such investments in the total investments into fixed assets declined. Therefore, the promotion of the smart grids can be fuelled by encouraging investments via public support and tax incentives. The analysis showed that domestic companies have appeared as the main source of investments following 2012. The increasing shares of the renewables in the newly installed capacities basically correspond to the goals of the development of smart grids in China.
As China has approached a “new normal,” the structural development of the economy and energy system is required to maintain a balance between economic growth, social objectives, and environmental pressures. In this regard, sustainable power grids may offer a solution. Successful implementation of the sustainable power grids in China requires technological development (including decision support systems) and public support schemes. In the economic dimension, improvements in the tariff system are also topical. These adjustments should be made with regards to the needs of different groups in society. The use of cleaner technologies on the smart grid will allow for achieving environmental sustainability.
This study features certain limitations. First, the determinants of electricity demand and investments into different technologies have not been explicitly modelled in this study. Second, the paper discusses the trends in the “new normal” period without undertaking forecasting. However, the rapid development of renewables in China makes this task rather complicated. Third, the discussion is mostly limited to China. Therefore, further studies may embark on international comparisons.

36,The distributional impacts of removing energy subsidies in China,"The distributional impact on households is an important factor for the acceptance of energy subsidy reform. Based on energy consumption features of the Chinese households at different income levels, this paper adopts an input–output price model to analyze possible impacts of removing energy subsidies on income distribution under different scenarios. Results show that: (1) The distributional impacts of removing subsidies vary by fossil fuels. From the perspectives of combined effects, transport fuel subsidy removal and coal subsidy removal have the strongest and the weakest progressive effects respectively, while the removal of electricity subsidies has a regressive effect. Moreover, the removal of petroleum product subsidies has the greatest impact on households, followed by the removal of electricity and coal subsidies, respectively. (2) Indirect impacts of energy subsidy reform are greater than direct impacts on households. (3) Government price controls can reduce the negative impact of energy subsidy reform. Policy implications are thus summarized. Energy subsidy reform can start from the energy that has the strongest progressive effect and the minimum impact on households. The Chinese government can take certain compensatory measures to mitigate the impact of reform on poor households.","Subsidies are an important policy instrument adopted by governments to attain economic, social and environmental objectives. Energy subsidies, which are widely considered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1998) and the International Energy Agency (IEA, 1999) as “any government action that raises the price received by energy producers, lowers the cost of energy production, or lowers the price paid by energy consumers”, are often used to alleviate energy poverty and promote economic development by enabling access to affordable modern energy services. Reddy (2002) showed that energy subsidies had played an important role in improving the living standard of the poor. Rubens, Mattos, and Balestieri (2006) also pointed out that smaller energy input could realize greater improvement of life quality in poor areas. Therefore, governments, especially in developing countries, consider energy subsidies as an essential part of macroeconomic policy, for achieving social and environmental targets as well as internalization of any welfare loss resulting from externalities. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing momentum to phase out certain types of energy subsidies that often fail to meet their intended objectives (IEA & OECD, 2010). Subsidies have been shown to impose serious fiscal burden on state budgets, encourage inefficient energy consumption, and consequently result in more CO2 emissions. A recent analysis from OECD indicates that phasing-out fossil fuel subsidies could lead to a 10% reduction in global greenhouse-gas emissions in 2050 compared with the scenario of business-as-usual (OECD, 2009, 2010).
Moreover, universal energy subsidies tend to be regressive, which benefit high-income households more than the low-income households. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank (2008) found that, in developing countries, the bottom 40% of the population ranked by income only received 15–20% of fuel subsidies. The IMF estimated that over 80% of the gasoline sub- sidies in 2009 flowed into the richest 40% of households, and for diesel and LPG, respectively, over 65% and 70% of benefits go to these income groups. (Coady, Gillingham, Ossowski, Piotrowski, Tareq & Tyson, 2006). Leigh and EI-Said (2006) analyzed the distributional impact of implicit fuel price subsidies in Gabon, and found that the bulk of subsidies benefited higher-income households. Specifically, the top 10% of individuals received about one-third of the total subsidy. Meanwhile, the bottom 30% of individuals received only 13% of the total subsidies. A similar phenomenon can be seen in household electricity subsidies of China: 22% of the low-income households only received 10.1% of household electricity subsidies, while 27% of high-income households received 45% of the total subsidies (Lin, Jiang and Lin, 2009).
Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the IEA, holds the opinion that fossil fuel subsidies are the appendicitis of the international energy system and should be cut out (IEA, 2008). In September 2009, G-20 leaders committed to “rationalize and phase out the inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage excessive consumption over the medium term” at the summit in Pittsburgh. In April 2011, the IEA made an appeal requiring the Chinese government to cut down energy subsidies as soon as possible. In this context, the elimination of energy subsidies is a crucial matter.
Currently, energy is subsidized in China by administratively depressing the domestic energy prices. Therefore, removing energy subsidies will inevitably lead to energy price increases, which would have a negative impact on the economy. The distributional impact of energy subsidy reform is a critical factor determining the acceptance of reform by the public. Given that alleviating energy poverty and making energy affordable to the poor are essential objectives of energy subsidies, the impacts of subsidy reform on the poor should be taken into consideration in the process of energy subsidy reform. G-20 leaders also emphasized the impor- tance of preventing any adverse impacts on the poorest people when reducing fossil fuel subsidies. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the distributional impact of energy subsidy reform on households in China. This paper intends to contribute to literature in this filed.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review on related studies; Section 3 analyzes the energy consumption features of households at different income levels in China; Section 4 simulates the possible impacts of eliminating fossil fuel subsidies on the income distribution in China; followed by conclusions and policy suggestions in Section 5.
2. Literature review
Given the critical role of energy in the economy, energy subsidy reform and its potential impacts have attracted wide attention and discussion. As an important research topic, income distribution has been investigated in many studies. The related literature mainly focused on whether energy subsidy removal would have a regressive effect. Most studies indicated that the effect of subsidy removal is regressive. For example, Saboohi (2001) conducted an empirical study on Iran and found that reducing energy subsidies would in- crease the living costs of low-income households. Specifically, if energy prices were raised to the levels of their long run marginal costs, the living costs would be increased by 28.7% for an urban household, and 33.7% for a rural household. The above finding is sup- ported by Coady, EI-Said, et al. (2006), who conducted the empirical study on fossil-fuel subsidy reform in the five countries of Bolivia, Ghana, Jordan, Mali and Sri Lanka. Andriamihaja and Vecchi (2007) estimated the effect of the rise in petroleum prices on living stan- dards in Madagascar, and found that a 17% rise in oil prices would lead to higher living expenditures, and the impact on low-income households (2.1%) was higher than that on high-income households (1.5%), indicating that subsidies benefited the rich more than the poor. Zhang (2011) evaluated the distributional consequences of electricity tariff reform in Turkey. The study revealed a highly skewed distribution of price elasticities in the population, with rich households three times more responsive in adjusting consump- tion to price changes than the poor. Moreover, the welfare loss of the poorest quintile was 2.9 times that of the wealthiest. Siddig, Aguiar, Grethe, Minor and Walmsley (2014) showed that a reduction in fuel import subsidies had a detrimental impact on household income in Nigeria, and in particular on poor households.
Some studies showed that the distributional impacts of energy subsidy reform were neutral or progressive. Freund and Wallich (2000) found that the welfare loss of higher energy prices was greater for the non-poor than for the poor in Poland. To be specific, the poor's welfare declined by 5.9%, while that of the richest quintile declined by 8.2%. Taking the Ethiopian urban households as an example, Kebede (2006) indicated that subsidies on kerosene prices and electricity tariffs did not significantly change the overall costs for households. Clements, Jung, and Gupta (2007) provided an evidence from Indonesia: under the Keynesian scenario, the decrease in real household consumption ranged from 2.1% to 2.7% for a 25% increase in petroleum prices, and high-income households suffered the most due to more consumption of petroleum products. Kpodar (2006) assessed the distributional effects of the rise in various petroleum product prices in Mali. The results showed that, although rising gasoline and diesel prices mainly affected non- poor households, rising kerosene prices were most harmful to the poor. Rao (2012) indicated that kerosene subsidies were regressive and of minimal financial value to poor rural households in India while progressive in urban areas. The regressive effects or welfare losses of energy subsidy reform can be dramatically reduced by providing some compensation to the poor and replacing subsidies with government transfers (Dartanto, 2013; Dube, 2003; Plante, 2014). The issue of energy subsidies in China has not been paid enough attention. Only a few researchers have investigated this problem (Jiang & Tan, 2013; Lin and Jiang, 2011; Lin & Ouyang, 2014), particularly in the field of the distributional impact of subsidy reform. From the perspective of consumer surplus, Lin, Jiang, and Lin (2009) analyzed the welfare loss of residential electricity subsidy removal. Results showed that low-income households would suffer more welfare loss than high-income households. However, on one hand, the existing studies did not take the distributional impact of removing subsidies on oil products into consideration; on the other, these studies did not take the government’s price controls on related sectors into account. Therefore, this paper tries to address the existing limitations and further discusses the distributional impacts of removing fossil-fuel subsidies.
3. Energy consumption of different income households
It is necessary to classify households to analyze the distributional effects of removing energy subsidies on households. Most related studies classified households by different income levels. Due to the limitation of data, we cannot obtain the de- tailed data about energy consumption of rural households at different income levels. Therefore, we only discuss the urban households in our paper. According to the “China Statistical Yearbook”, urban households at different income levels can be di- vided into 7 groups, which include the lowest income group (10%), low-income group (10%), mid-low income group (20%), middle-income group (20%), mid-high income group (20%), high-income group (10%) and the highest income group (10%).1 The main household consumption types of energy include coal, gasoline, diesel, kerosene, natural gas and electricity. Accord- ing to the ‘energy ladder’ theory, low-income households usually rely on traditional fuels such as coal, while high-income households mainly use modern energy that is much cleaner (Barnes, Plas, & Floor, 1997; Masera, Saatkamp, & Kammen, 2000). Based on the “China Urban Life and Price Yearbook 2011” and “China Energy Statistical Yearbook 2011”, we obtain the data of household consumption of different fuels which is consistent with the findings from Barnes et al. (1997) and Masera et al. (2000) (see Fig. 1).
The main energy consumption types of low-income and high-income households are quite different: the former mainly uses the traditional energy such as coal, while the latter basically uses modern energy such as transport fuels. In China, coal consumption per capita of the lowest and the highest income households were 72.67 kg and 4.13 kg in 2010, respectively. The consumption of transport fuels increased rapidly with the improvement in income. The per capita transport fuel consumption of the high-income group (81.55 kg) was much higher than that of the lowest income group (2.06 kg) due to the higher vehicle ownership rates. To summarize, the energy ladder phenomenon would be more obvious if the income gap was greater.
Based on the “China Urban Life and Price Yearbook”, we obtain data of transport fuel expenditures of residents at different income levels. The expenditures of coal and electricity were calculated by the amounts of consumption multiplied by their prices. The average price of steam coal in Qinhuangdao is reprehensive and thus is used as coal price in China. Household electricity price comes from the report published by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). Energy expenditures of different income groups are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 indicates that the levels of household energy consumption expenditures differ greatly among different income groups. Energy consumption expenditures would be greater if the household income levels were higher. Results show that the lowest- income households (Group 1) only spend CNY 282.99 on energy per year, while the highest-income households (Group 7) spend CNY 1678.44 on energy each year. In the aspect of different energy types, Table 1 also shows that low-income households spend more on coal, while high-income households consume more electricity and transport fuels. Particularly, transport fuel expenditure soars with the increase of income. Such phenomenon can be explained by the increasing number of cars owned by high-income households. According to “China Statistical Yearbook 2011”, car ownership of the lowest and the highest income households were 1.96 and 42.47 per one hundred households in 2010, respectively. Table 2 further analyzes the structure of energy expenditures of different income groups.
Table 2 shows that the structure of household energy expenditures is also distinct among different income groups. Firstly, the shares of expenditures on coal and electricity in total household expenditures decrease with the improvement of income, while the proportion of expenditures on transport fuels increases with income improvement. For example, the share of expenditures on trans- port fuels is only 0.52% for the lowest income households, while the number is 3.53% for the highest-income households. Secondly, electricity expenditure accounts for the majority of energy expenditures (3.8%) for the lowest-income households. On the contrary, transport fuel expenditures account for the majority of energy expenditures for high-income households, while the share of coal expenditure is quite small (0.01%). Thirdly, low-income households are burdened with relatively heavier energy expenditures, and the share of energy expenditure in total expenditure is the lowest for middle-income households (about 4.23%). The structure of energy expenditures is presented in Fig. 2.
Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that high-income households tend to consume more modern energy, especially transport fuels such as gasoline and diesel. However, due to the imperfect subsidy mechanism, only thermal coal is subsidized in China, and there are no subsidies for coal used in residential sector. Therefore, subsidies for the modern energy disproportionately benefit the rich rather than the poor. On one hand, the non-targeted subsidy mechanism is not conducive to reducing energy poverty; on the other, it will widen inequality and lead to excessive energy consumption of high-income households. Thus, the regressive energy subsidies should be removed to improve equity and efficiency. In the following section, this paper will estimate the distributional effects of eliminating energy subsidies on households at different income levels.
4. Distributional impacts of removing energy subsidies
Removing energy subsidies would push up energy prices and affect consumers' expenditure through two channels: on one hand, household expenditures on fuels will be directly increased due to the rise of fuel prices caused by the removal of energy subsidies; on the other hand, household expenditures on energy-intensive products and services will be indirectly increased due to the increased costs of production factors and raw materials. Therefore, the distributional effect of removing energy subsidies can be divided into the direct effect and the indirect effect. Wier, Birr-Pedersen, Jacobsen, and Klok (2005) pointed out that the use of the total household expenditure might be more preferable than the income. There are two reasons for that: first, energy consumption can be measured by energy expenditure, which is more relevant to measure the regressivity relative to income; second, since households seek to smooth consumption over their life cycle according to the permanent income hypothesis, actual income may be inappropriate to measure the regressivity. Therefore, this paper uses the impact of removing energy subsidies on household expenditure to analyze its distributional effects on households.
4.1. Direct effects
The direct effects of removing subsidies refer to the impacts on households' expenditures through the direct fuel consumption. Assuming that there are no energy substitutions and household energy demand keeps constant when removing energy subsidies,2 the direct effect is equal to the share of energy expenditure in household total expenditure multiplied by the percent- age of energy price increase. The formula is as follows: where ΔEd denotes the direct impact of prices rise on household expenditures; Ei is the per capita energy consumption expenditures of the ith energy; E is the per capita consumption expenditure; and ΔPi represents for the price change of the ith energy.
Generally, the Chinese government subsidizes energy by depressing the consumer price. This implies that removing subsidies will lead to energy price rise. Hence, without the consideration of price changes caused by other factors, we can assume that the rise in energy prices due to the removal of fossil-fuel subsidies is equal to the energy subsidy rate. Lin and Jiang (2011) estimated that the average subsidy rate of coal in China is 9.9%, and the average subsidy rates of household transport fuels and electricity are 24.39% and 11.84%, respectively. According to formula (1), we can calculate the direct distributional impacts of removing energy subsidies on different income households (Table 3).
The Chinese government only controls the price of thermal coal, and the prices of other coals are market-oriented. Hence, the price rise of thermal coal caused by coal subsidy elimination will not have a direct impact on household coal consumption. Table 3 shows that the direct effect of eliminating electricity subsidies is regressive, and the impact will be greater for households with lower income. Specifically, the proportion of electricity consumption expenditure will increase by 0.449% for the lowest-income households, while the proportion will only increase by 0.207% for the highest income households. Comparatively, the direct effect of removing subsidies for oil products is progressive, which is mainly because the expenditure proportion of transport fuels is much higher for high-income groups. In conclusion, energy expenditure structure is an important factor that impacts the direct effects on households.
4.2. Indirect effects under the scenario of no government price controls
The indirect effects influence household expenditures by the demand for goods which use energy as an important input. The input–output model has been widely used to evaluate the indirect effect on households (Fan & Zhang, 2013; Labandeira & Labeaga, 1999; Mathur & Morris, 2014; Wier et al., 2005). This approach generally assumes that there are no energy substitutions in the pro- duction process when removing energy subsidies, and the cost imposed on producers are fully transmitted into the final commodity prices (Ahmad & Stern, 2009; Wier et al., 2005). We follow this approach in this paper, although the degree of cost transmission depends on the technological development and substitution possibilities in industries as well as in households. In addition, this approach does not consider the effects of government interventions on prices, that is, there are no lags in price transmission. This assumption indicates that the traditional input–output model is based on theoretical conditions where there are no government price controls.
4.2.1. Input–output price model
The price change in one sector could result in the price changes in other economic sectors. Assuming that the price change of the kth sector is ΔPk, the total effects can be expressed as follows: Expanding formula (2), we can get: where ΔPi is the price change of the ith sector; and aij is the direct consumption coefficient in the input–output table. Removing the kth row and the kth column, formula (3) can be expressed in the matrix form as follows: where An − 1 is the (n − 1) × (n − 1) direct consumption coefficient matrix, which is derived from the n × n direct consumption coefficient matrix after eliminating the kth row and kth column. According to formula (4), if the price in the kth sector increases ΔPk, the effects on the price of other sectors can be estimated. 4.2.2. Indirect effects of the removal of energy subsidies
In order to estimate the indirect effects of removing energy subsidies, we first analyze the grouping of household consumption. According to the “China Urban Life and Price Yearbook”, household expenditures can be divided into nine categories: “food”, “clothing”, “residence”, “household facilities and articles and services”, “health care and medical services”, “transport and communications”, “education”, “cultural and recreation services”, and “miscellaneous goods and services”. Low-income households pay more for food. With the income rise, the proportion of expenditure on food tends to decrease, while the proportions of expenditures on transportation and communications tend to increase rapidly (Fig. 3).
Based on the residential consumption categories, we merge the input–output table of 42 sectors published by “National Bureau of Statistics of China”. For example, “Food manufacturing and tobacco processing” corresponds to “food products”; “textile clothing shoe cap leather down and their products” corresponds to “clothing”; “education” and “culture, sport and recreation” are merged into “education, culture and entertainment services”. After that, according to Eq. (5), the indirect effect of removing energy subsidies could be estimated under the scenario that without government price controls. The results are presented in Table 4.
Table 4 suggests that the indirect effects of removing fossil-fuel subsidies are slightly progressive. Removing oil product subsidies has the greatest indirect effects on household expenditures, followed by the removal of electricity subsidies, and the removal of coal subsidies has the smallest indirect effect. Price rises of gasoline and diesel oil resulting from the elimination of energy subsidies are the highest. Particularly, gasoline and diesel oil are closely related to the intermediate inputs in various sectors. Comparing Tables 3 and 4, we can find that the indirect effects are much larger than the direct effects. Take the removal of subsidies for transport fuels as an ex- ample. The direct effect on the highest-income households (Group 7) is 0.86%, while the indirect effect is 1.525%.
4.3. Indirect effects under the scenario that with government price controls
4.3.1. Model
As mentioned above, the impact of government interventions on prices has not been taken into account in the input–output price model. However, the features of energy such as natural monopolies and externalities determine that government interferences would be common. Inevitably, government price controls would lead to price distortions. Energy price rises would be blocked, and made hard to be transferred to the downstream products. Therefore, analyzing the distributional impacts of removing energy subsidies under the scenario that with government price controls is of great significance. In this section, we follow the input–output approach adopted by Coady and Newhouse (2005). In order to simplify the analysis, all sectors are divided into two categories: sectors that with government price controls, and sectors that without government price controls.
The government determines producer prices for sectors with government price controls. The relationship between the producer price and the consumer price is as follows: The change in consumer prices is equal to the change in producer prices plus the changes in taxes. where qc denotes the consumer price in regulated sectors, p* denotes the producer price in regulated sectors, t c is tax, and Δ stands for the change in variables.
For sectors without government price controls, energy price changes can completely transfer to the prices of final goods. The relationship between the user price and the producer price is given by: 
The producer price of the non-controlled sectors is pnc = pnc(q, w). Where q denotes the user cost of intermediate input and w is the factor price. For these sectors, cost increases are assumed to be fully reflected by user prices so that the factor payments are fixed. According to formula (8), consumer price changes of non-controlled sectors can be expressed as follows: In which, Δqnc denotes the change in consumer price, Δpnc is the change in producer price, and Δtnc represents the change in tax.
3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 denote the lowest income group, low-income group, mid-low income group, mid income group, mid-high
When the price change of the kth sector is ΔPk, its impact on non-controlled jth sector would be: where α i denotes the proportion of intermediate input from the non-controlled sectors in the jth sector; βi stands for the proportion of intermediate input from controlled sectors in the jth sector. 0 ≤ (αn, βn) ≤ 1, αn + βn = 1.
Formula (10) can be expressed as the matrix: The above equation can be simplified as: Then, the price change of non-controlled sectors can be expressed as: 4.3.2. Indirect effects of removing energy subsidies
According to the energy policy in China, five sectors that with government price controls in the energy industry are set: “mining and washing of coal”, “extraction of petroleum and natural gas”, “processing of petroleum, coking, processing of nuclear fuel”, “production and distribution of electric power”, “production and distribution of gas”. It is assumed that when certain types of energy subsidies are eliminated, prices of controlled sectors cannot rise due to government price controls, while price changes of sectors that without government price controls can be completely transferred to the prices of final products. The indirect effects of removing energy subsidies under government price controls are shown in Table 5.
Table 5 indicates that with government price controls, the indirect effects of removing energy subsidies are still progressive; however, the impacts are much smaller than the scenario that without price controls, especially for coal. Take the highest-income households (Group 7) for example, the indirect effects of removing coal subsidies drops from 0.292% that without government price controls to 0.095% that with government price controls. This is mainly because the power sector consumes more than 50% of coal in China, and the rise in coal prices cannot be transferred to the downstream industries due to the electricity price controls. Even with the price controls, the indirect effects are still greater than the direct effects. 4.3.3. The combined distributional impacts of energy subsidy reform
Assuming that there are no energy substitutions, the removal of a certain type of energy subsidy will not lead to a price change for other energy, and the direct effects will be the same under the two scenarios that with and without government price controls on energy sectors. Therefore, adding up the direct and indirect effects under the two scenarios, we can obtain the combined effects of removing fossil-fuel subsidies (see Table 6).
Table 6 shows that the total distributional impact of removing energy subsidies differs greatly among different energy products. Firstly, the total distributional impacts of subsidy reform on different income groups are diverse. The impact of removing transport fuel subsidies is strongly progressive; the impact is weakly progressive for coal and is regressive for the removal of electricity subsi- dies. Secondly, different kinds of energy subsidy removal have different impacts on households. For instance, removing subsidies for oil products has the largest impacts on household consumption expenditures. Thirdly, government price controls can significantly mitigate the impact of subsidy reform, especially for coal. Finally, regardless of whether there are price controls or not, the indirect effects are much larger than the direct effects (Fig. 4). 5. Conclusions and policy recommendations
5.1. Conclusions
In 2009, G-20 leaders committed to “rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuels”. As fossil fuel subsidies in China usually take the form of depressing consumer prices, removing energy subsidies will inevitably lead to energy price rise, and have a distributional impact on households. This paper estimates the impacts of removing energy subsidies on household expenditures in different income groups. The main conclusions are summarized as follows.
Firstly, energy consumption levels and structures differ greatly among various income households. Energy expenditures will increase with the improvement in income; however, the proportion of energy expenditure in the total expenditure is relatively high for low-income households. The proportions of coal and electricity expenditures in the total expenditure decreases with the improvement in income, while the share of transport fuel expenditure in the total expenditure increases with income improvement. Electricity expenditure accounts for the majority of energy expenditure for the lowest-income households, while expenditures on transport fuels account for the majority of energy expenditure for the highest-income households. Secondly, the distributional effect of removing energy subsidies can be divided into two aspects of direct and indirect effects, and the indirect effects are much greater than the direct effects. The total distributional effect of removing subsidies for oil products is significantly progressive, while the impact is weakly progressive for coal and is regressive for the removal of electricity subsidies. In addition, the impacts are different for different types of energy. The removal of subsidies for oil products has the largest impact on household expenditures, followed by removing subsidies for electricity and coal.
Thirdly, government price controls have significant impacts on the indirect effects. Although the regressive nature of the indirect effects remains unchanged, the degree of indirect effects decreases significantly. 5.2. Policy recommendations
Welfare economist Rawls holds the opinion that the worst-off group should be taken into account to guarantee distributive justice. G-20 leaders also emphasize the need to prevent adverse impacts on the poorest when reducing fossil fuel subsidies. In order to mitigate the impact of subsidy reform on poor households, a reasonable reform route should be designed. The government may consider starting with the subsidy reform of coal, because the impact of removing coal subsidies is the smallest compared with other fuels. Furthermore, removing subsidies for thermal coal has no direct impacts on household expenditure. The next step could be removing subsidies for oil products, because the effect of removing oil product subsidies is progressive. More attention should be paid to electricity which is more relevant to household living than other fuels, and the distributional impact of removing electricity subsidies is regressive. In addition, Suárez (1995) emphasized that investment in power had a remarkable impact on advancing the Human Development Index (HDI) at the primary development. Therefore, the government may consider reforming electricity subsi- dies at last, and the reform should focus on the mechanism design and the improvement of targeted electricity subsidies. The results show that the indirect impact of energy reform on households is much greater than the direct impact. Energy price rise caused by the removal of subsidies would drive the increase in prices of other commodities, which would lead to the cost-driven inflation, even though there may be some lags. To summarize, the government should pay more attention to the indirect effects of subsidy reform.
It seems that government controls on energy price may reduce the distributional impact of energy subsidy reform on households. In addition, the government should design effective and targeted subsidy to reduce the impact of pricing reforms, rather than only implementing price controls. There are many other ways to protect the poor. Plante (2014) showed that replacing subsidies with government transfers could dramatically reduce welfare losses. Direct transfers include cash benefits or near-cash transfers (such as vouchers or smart cards), and indirect transfers include waivers of fees to help households maintain access to the essential services such as health, education, and transportation pointed out by IEA (2010). Saboohi (2001) suggested that the additional financial resources obtained from the reduction of energy subsidies could be allocated for compensating the decrease in the purchasing power of households. Tarr and Jensen (2002) found that if the Iranian government transferred all the savings from subsidy removal to the poor, the income of poor households would increase by 200% in rural areas and 100% in urban areas, respectively. In addition, energy subsidy reform is more likely to be accepted when wide social reforms are carried out simultaneously, such as establishing the social security system.

37,The economics of coal power generation in China,"The Chinese government recently released the 13th FYP (five-year plan) power development plan and proposed a capacity installation target of 1100GW for coal power. Considering the weak demand growth of coal power since 2014, continuous decline in the annual utilisation hour and the coming market competition, such a planning target is unwelcome and could further the economic deterioration of coal power. In this paper, we employ LCOE (levelised cost of electricity) and project evaluation models to conduct a nationwide survey on the economics of coal power. The economic analysis has clearly indicated that the recent boom of coal power investment in China, which is absurd in many perspectives, is largely the aftermath of uncompleted market reform in the power sector. However, the fundamentals of electricity demand and supply are changing at a speed beyond the imagination of power generators and have foreboded a gloomy prospect for coal power. Our study shows that by 2020, with several exceptions, in most provinces the internal rate of return for coal power will drop below the social average return rate or will even be negative. In this regard, the 13th FYP capacity planning target for coal power is economically untenable and requires radical revision.","1. Introduction
With a 2.3% reduction in thermal power generation and only 0.5% growth in total electricity consumption, China's new addition of coal power capacity in 2015 is incompatibly high at 52 GW (CEC, 2016a). Regarding the operation efficiency and profitability of coal power, the paradox is self-evident. The annual utilisation hour of thermal power was only 4329 h in 2015, down by 410 h as of the 2014 level and hit the lowest record since 1969 (CEC, 2016a). But in terms of profitability, the coal power sector appeared to take advantage of the apparent imbalance between coal price and on-grid benchmarking tariff and reaped high profits, reaching a historic record since the 2000s (Polaris Power Net, 2016). In China, the government strictly regulates the on- grid tariff of coal power, although market force largely determines coal price. Though a co-movement mechanism for adjusting on-grid tariff had been formulated by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) since 2004 and updated three times since, it was only loosely and arbitrarily implemented (Polaris Power Net, 2016; NDRC, 2015a).
It seems that the interest of power generation companies in investing new coal power projects is strong. A recent study by Greenpeace and CoalSwarm (2016) indicated that approximately 73–79GW-capacity projects are currently under construction, which represents significant growth compared to new installation in the previous year. Such a discord in supply and demand is further illustrated by the project scale under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) approval announced by either the Ministry of Environment Protection or its provincial counterparts in 2015. The total capacity amounted to 169 GW, of which 159 GW has been granted or pre-granted by the EIA approval (Yuan et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). This represents a significant increase when compared with the total EIA-approved capacity for the same period in 2014—which was 48 GW (Greenpeace, 2015).
Although thermal power has enjoyed the best economic return since the 2014 downturn of coal price, discrepancies are apparent in the sector's profitability. In 2015, the thermal power utilisation hour in Yunnan, a province well-known for its rich resources in hydropower, was only 1879 h, while the utilisation hour in Sichuan was 2682 h. In Gansu, a province rich in renewable energy resources, fewer than 3800 h of annual utilisation was recorded, while Jilin documented only 3300 h. The coal power sector fell below the break-even point rapidly in these provinces.
The industry institution, China Electricity Council (CEC), expressed its deep worry on the profitability of coal power by publishing a report in March 2016 (CEC, 2016b). The National Energy Administration (NEA) and NDRC (2016) subsequently issued a prewarning mechan- ism, which consists of an economic warning indicator, a capacity adequacy indicator and a resource constraint indicator. The first pre- warning is for new projects that will be commissioned by 2019. With a traffic-light reading system, the result shows that the alert status of 28 provincial grid regions are rated as “red”, and only Jiangxi, Anhui and Hainan Province are rated as “green”, while Hubei Province is in the “orange” status. For capacity adequacy indicator, 24 provinces obtain “red alert”, and only Jiangxi, Anhui, Hainan, Southern Hebei, Sichuan and Yunnan obtain “green” pre-warning. For the economic warning indicator, 14 provinces are given “red” alert, while the remaining 17 provinces are read as “green”. Considering the overcapacity in these provinces, the economic warning results are not convincing.
In November 2016, the 13th FYP Power Planning was issued (NDRC and NEA, 2016). The 1100 GW planning target for coal power, which requires new installation of 200 GW by 2020, has aroused hot debate in industry observers. The controversies are mainly on two interrelated aspects: the rational capacity target for coal power and the economic base underlying it. For the first point, though the future role of coal in China's energy supply has been extensively discussed without dispute (see, for example, Yuan et al., 2012, 2014; Hao et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2015, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; among others), academic inquiry on coal's role in China's power system is surprisingly rare and disputable (Na et al., 2015; Hui et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). For the second point, to the best of our knowledge, only a recent report by Yuan (2016) studied the economics of coal power in six typical provinces. Because economic return is central to the debate and has direct impact on the perspective of coal power in China, this issue deserves systematic study.
This study's purpose is to provide a panoramic overview on coal power's economics in China into 2020 and answer whether the 1,100 GW target proposed in the 13th FYP planning is economically feasible. The paper's structure is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the methodology. Section 3 presents the results and discus- sions. Section 4 concludes the paper with policy implications.
2. Methodology
2.1. Economic indicators
2.1.1. LCOE
A 600 MW coal power plant is chosen as the objective because currently in China, a 600 MW ultra-supercritical (USC) unit is the mainstream of new installation. Projecting the economy of coal power first necessitates the estimate of generation cost and its dynamics. LCOE refers to the costs of electricity per kWh of power generation during the entire operation period and is a widely recognized and highly transparent calculation method for electricity costs (Branker et al., 2011). This paper will calculate the LCOE by calculating the percentage between the present value of total costs and expenses from initial construction to operation and the economic time value of the energy output during the life of a 600 MW coal-fired plant.
2.1.2. Full investment internal rate of return (IRR) and its grading scale
Appraising the economics of new coal power involves project financial appraisal. An economic appraisal method analyses the investment, costs, revenues, taxes and profits of the engineering projects under an existing accounting system and tax regulations and price system of the state (Fu and Quan, 1996). It involves a study of the profitability, solvency and financial viability of the project after being put into operation, and judges the financial economics of the project based upon such an appraisal. In addition to specifying the value of the engineering project to the financial entity and the contribution to investors, the project financial appraisal also provides a basis for investment and financing decision making.
IRR refers to the discount rate when the total present value of fund
inflow equals the total present value of fund outflow, and the NPV is equal to zero. The advantage of the IRR method is to link the project returns during its lifetime with its total investment and indicate the rate of return of the project to provide a benchmark rate of return to confirm whether the project is worthy of investment. IRR is generally recognized as a profitability indicator for project investment. In project financial appraisal, “full investment” and “proprietary funds” assess- ment are differentiated. Because the purpose here is the economics of the project, not the profitability of own investment, we use full investment IRR as the indicator, which is consistent with that employed by NEA and NDRC (2016).
NEA and NDRC (2016) employed a traffic-light warning system. With return rate of long-term treasury bond as the baseline, a projected IRR below it will get a “red” alert. Those between treasury bond return rate and the average IRR (8% in China) of power generation projects will get an “orange” alert. The projects with IRR higher than 8% will have a “green” reading. Actually, 8% benchmarking return requirement is for proprietary funds, and with a convention of 30% own investment ratio, the sector's benchmarking full investment IRR is 6.6% (NDRC and MOC, 2006). Accordingly, we design the grading scale system as follows (Table 1).
2.2. Data and estimate process
Many variables and parameters are involved in conducting an LCOE estimate and project financial appraisal, which may be divided into four categories: technical and economic variables, operation and maintenance costs variables, taxes and charges and financial variables (Fig. 1). Most are common parameters used in the LCOE model and financial appraisal; however, some parameters are used only in the LCOE model or financial appraisal. Table 2 reports the key common parameters for the estimate, while Table 3 reports the province-specific parameters.
Our economic analysis starts from the estimate of LCOEs of a typical 600 MW USC coal power plant installed in case provinces by the end of 2015. By comparing LCOEs with the current actual on-grid tariff levels in each province, we could assess the profitability of coal power in these provinces and term it as 2015 baseline. Then we will project the profitability situation by 2020 by considering the following factors:
1) The decrease of annual utilisation hour
Given the irrationally high scale of coal power projects under
construction and planning and the weak demand growth prospec- tive during the 13th FYP period, a pessimistic prospective on the annual utilisation of coal power is predicted (Yuan et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Greenpeace, 2016). National average utilisation hours are predicted to drop to 3600 h by 2020 (Yuan et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c). We then calibrate the estimate for coal power in different provinces by considering the differences of national, regional and provincial demand growth rates, as well as the differences in new capacity under construction.
2) Higher generation cost incurred by more stringent environment regulation and the national carbon market.
In terms of environment regulation, we consider the declared target in the Implementation Plan of Ultra-low Emission and Energy Saving Retrofitting of Coal-fired Plants promulgated by NEA (2015), which requires that ultra-low emission retrofitting of coal-fired units should be completed by 2017, 2018 and 2020 in eastern, central and western regions, respectively.
In June 2015, China submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to the United Nations (NDRC, 2015b). This plan commits to peak greenhouse emissions by 2030 and to reach it as quickly as possible. The 13th FYP is the crucial stage for the implementation of China's greenhouse gas policies, and China will launch a national carbon emission trading system in 2017 (NDRC, 2016). The rigidity of carbon price will inevitably increase the costs of coal power. In such an oversupply market environment, power-generation enterprises will and must internally bear con- siderable percentage of the anticipated carbon costs.
3) Price reduction, bilateral trading and electricity market
In March 2015, the issuance of the Several Opinions on Further Deepening Electric Power System Reform (“No.9 Document”) kicked off the new round of power system reform (The State Council of China, 2015). The No.9 Document sets forth the recent key tasks of reform, including “the realization of the market-oriented power generation and retail price (except for public welfare undertakings)”, “guiding the market entities to carry out multi-party direct transaction” and “encouraging the establishment of long-term stable transaction me- chanism and construction of the long-term stable bilateral market mode”. The steady implementation of the No.9 Document means the market-oriented purchase and sale of electricity will be promoted faster (The State Council of China, 2015), implying that the wholesale tariff of coal power is expected to fall sharply in the environment of over- capacity. A survey on the pilot in several provinces indicates a range of 0.3-0.12 yuan/KWh reduction in the bilateral trading prices compared to the benchmarking on-grid tariff levels regulated by NDRC (China Energy Newspaper, 2015).
Though the introduction of the electricity market will take time, under the current co-movement mechanism between on-grid tariff and coal price, with a big drop in coal price, NDRC (2015c) declared to lower the national average of the benchmarking on-grid tariff for coal power by 0.03 yuan/KWh from January 2016. In the near term, because of the Chinese government's strong determination to lower electricity tariff to activate the economy's vitality, a co-movement mechanism would not be kicked off even if coal price rebounded to the threshold (The State Council of China, 2016), which implies that generators will have to bear the cost increase by themselves. In the long term, with the deepening of power sector reform, the co-movement mechanism will be abandoned and give way to market force.
3.1. 2015 case
Coal price and utilisation hour are the two factors that have largest impact on the LCOEs of coal power. In recent years, because of persistent oversupply, coal price has been on a continuous decline. According to the steam coal (5000 kcal) price index issued by Price Monitor Center, NDRC (2016), the price dropped by 36% in May 2016 relative to the level in January 2014 and returned to the 2004 level. Only in Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hunan and Jiangxi, coal price above 400 Yuan/tonne is observed, while in Shanxi and Xinjiang it is well below 200 Yuan/tonne. Because fuel accounts for roughly 50–60% of gen- eration cost, low coal price will certainly lead to lower generation cost.
Utilisation hour is another key factor. According to the sector's practice, if coal units’ annual utilisation hour is higher than 5500 h, then new capacity installation is necessary; if the utilisation hour is fewer than 4500 h, then overcapacity is detected and no new installa- tion is needed (Polaris Power Net, 2015). The national average in 2015 was 4329 h, while in most provinces, the number was lower. With 5500 h as a reference, the utilisation rate of coal power was roughly 78% in 2015, indicating serious overcapacity.
Fig. 2 reports the estimate LCOEs of coal power for each province. The regional pattern is high at eastern regions while low at western regions, high at southern regions while low at northern regions, which is consistent with the regional endowment of coal resources. The LCOE is the highest at 0.4 yuan/KWh in provinces as Yunnan and Guangxi. In 16 provinces, such as Sichuan, the LCOE ranges between 0.3 and 0.4 yuan/KWh. In the other 12 provinces, the LCOE is below 0.3 yuan/ KWh. In particular, in four coal-based provinces (Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Ningxia), the LCOE is well below 0.25 yuan/ KWh.
Note: 1) The study does not cover Tibet and Taiwan. 2) Beijing is not included because of its policy to close all coal power plants.
NDRC declared to reduce the on-grid tariff of coal power by 0.03 yuan/KWh in 2016 (NDRC, 2015c). Fig. 3 reports the price gap between the effective on-grid tariff and LCOE at each province. According to the concept of LCOE and the pricing rules of on-grid tariff in China, zero gap between them means that the generator can have the benchmarking return while positive gap means that the generator can enjoy extra profit. According to our study, the national average of the price gap is 0.06 Yuan/KWh. At the provincial level, the highest gap (0.13 Yuan/KWh) is in Guangdong and Hainan; the second highest (0.10–0.11 Yuan/KWh) is in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Ningxia and Hunan provinces. In all the other provinces, the price gap is less than 0.10 Yuan/KWh. Marginal price gap (0.01–0.03 Yuan/KWh) is in Guangxi, Qinghai and Gansu. Here we confirm again that the generous profit space by the price gap is an important economic factor driving the investment bubble and overcapacity Figs. 4–6.
We further estimate the full investment IRRs of coal power at the provincial level. With the only exception of Yunnan province, in all other provinces the IRR is higher than the sector's benchmarking return rate (6.6%). In 21 provinces, the IRR of coal power is higher than 12%, among which in provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shaanxi and Hainan, the IRR is larger than 15%. Generally speaking, under the present environment, the return on investment in coal power is very impressive, which can largely explain record high new projects despite weak demand growth and deterio- rated annual utilisation.
3.2. 2020 case
We consider two scenarios when making the projection into 2020. The first scenario takes the ultra-low emission requirement, national carbon market and electricity market reform into the estimate. To comply with the ultra-low emission requirement, an extra 110 million Yuan will be invested. The denitration rate and desulfurization rate will rise from 80% to 95% and 90%, respectively, while the operation of denitration and desulfurization facilities will lead to efficiency penalty in heat rate. For the carbon market, we assume a low carbon price (30 Yuan/tonne) by 2020, while the generator will bear 30% of it. For electricity market reform, we anticipate that the share of direct power purchase in total electricity consumption will rise from 10% at 2015 to 80% at 2020, and the settlement price will decrease radically. For the first scenario, it is assumed that the utilisation hour would hold constant at the 2015 level. Scenario 2 considers the impact of new installation on annual utilisation hour. In this way, the difference between scenario 1 and scenario 2 is solely the impact of new projects.
The LCOEs of coal power are expected to increase in the two 2020 scenarios. On the national average, an increase of at least 0.02 Yuan/ KWh is expected in scenario 1. In a province such as Yunnan, the increase is substantial at 0.04 Yuan/KWh. It is evident that with the deepening of power sector reform and the implementation of a series of clean and low-carbon policies, the cost of coal power generation will step into an uptrend channel. By 2020, 22 provinces will have LCOEs ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 Yuan/KWh under scenario 1, while the number is 16 in 2015. In southwest provinces (Yunnan and Guangxi) with rich hydropower resources, the LCOEs of coal power will reach above 0.4 Yuan/KWh. Provinces with lower LCOEs are still those with abundant coal resources, including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, Hebei and Henan.
In scenario 2, with the commission of more new coal power plants, the LCOEs will continue to rise. Relative to scenario 1, an increase of 0.01–0.02 Yuan/KWh will be expected. The expected increase is not uniform across the provincial level. In provinces with high new capacity under construction (Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shandong, Inner Mongolia and Guangdong), the increase ranges between 0.02 and 0.03 Yuan/KWh. In scenario 2, by 2020, 23 provinces will have LCOEs ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 Yuan/KWh. Sichuan will have LCOE above 0.4 Yuan/KWh largely because of serious deterioration in utilisation hour.
Though the upward trend of LCOE is moderate on average, the drop in IRR will be significant, by 6.95% in scenario 1 as to 2015 level on national average. In 10 provinces (Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Xinjiang), the IRRs will drop below 4.2%, the long-term treasury bond rate of the present period (Ministry of Finance, 2016). Note that most of these provinces are southwest provinces with plenty of hydropower resources or northwest provinces with weak demand growth and rich renewable resources. It is also worth noting that Xinjiang is on the list of “red” alert, largely because of the huge scale of new installation despite small and weak local demand. In particular, in three provinces (Guangxi, Qinghai and Yunnan), the IRRs are expected to be negative, implying the most serious impact of unchecked coal power. Eight provinces (Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Tianjin, Anhui, Henan and Fujian) will have “orange” alert in scenario 1. Note that two most important coal-power-based provinces, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, are on the list of “orange” alert under scenario 1. In five provinces (Shandong, Hubei, Shanghai, Jiangxi and Zhejiang) the IRRs will fall to the marginal zone. Note that in 2015 the IRRs are well above 12% in these provinces. Only six provinces can enjoy IRRs higher than the sector's average return rate (8%), including Guangdong, Hainan, Hebei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi.
Remember that scenario 1 is rather optimistic and unrealistic because utilisation hour is assumed to be the same as 2015 levels. Nonetheless, radical deterioration in the economic return can clearly demonstrate the myopia of the investment behaviours of Chinese generators. In scenario 2, when the impact of new installation on utilisation hour is considered, a deep fall in IRRs would be expected. Another five provinces (Henan, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Shanxi and Anhui) will be added to the list of “red” alert, while Ningxia and Guangxi will get negative IRRs. Only three provinces (Guangdong, Hainan and Hunan) can enjoy more than 8% IRRs because these provinces have fewer new projects. Our projection explicitly reveals a highly negative correlation between the scale of new projects and return expectation. 3.3. Discussions and sensitivity analysis
The impact of three factors on the prospective of coal power economics deserves further discussions, the first being pollutant emissions tax, the second carbon price and the last coal price.
Currently, legislation on pollutant emissions tax is underway in China. Though in the initial stage it is only a switch from an emissions fee to an emissions tax, an increase in the emissions tax seems unavoidable. We predict that coal-fired plants will face stricter pressure in pollutant control, even accounting for any subsidies that may be available to the plants upon ultra-low emission retrofitting, which will rise substantially in the future. The current emission charge level of 1260 Yuan/tonne equivalent for main pollutants as dust, NOx and SO2 is much lower than the social cost of emissions (Yuan and Cheng, 2011). The local standard is 10,000 Yuan/tonne equivalent in Beijing, and Shanghai is planning to raise the level to 6000–8000 Yuan/tonne equivalent in the coming years. A higher emissions tax will lead to an increase in the cost of coal-power generation.
The assumption of carbon price level in our scenario study is rather conservative. According to Ouyang (2016), it is reported that the Chinese government envisions the carbon price starting from a low level at 30–50 Yuan/tonne by 2020 to an ideal level at about 200–300 Yuan/tonne when the market is mature. However, because of the vast uncertainty on when carbon price will reach such a level, in our study we set a more likely price level at 30 Yuan/tonne for 2020. Our projection may underestimate the impact of carbon price on the economic return of coal power.
The unexpected rise of coal price in 2016 has already resulted in great loss of coal power in many provinces. In provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Gansu and Shanxi, the price of steam coal price increased by 80–100 Yuan/tonne from January to September 2016. In provinces such as Anhui and Shandong, the increase is by more than 120 Yuan/tonne (Price Monitor Center of NDRC, 2016). Coal price alone has pushed up the generation cost by 0.04–0.06 Yuan/KWh in 2016; however, under oversupply direct power purchasing is still cutting down the price. Therefore, though the long-term trend of coal price is highly uncertain, the instant impact is that what we expect for 2020 (serious economic deterioration of coal power) has already appeared in advance.
To ensure the robustness of our results, here we further conduct sensitivity analysis based on scenario 2 of 2020. Because under any changing conditions, the dark red provinces are impossible to become economically attractive, here the interest is on whether variations in some critical factors will change the rating of those provinces— for example, between “red” and “orange”, or between “orange” and “yellow”. Here we conduct sensitivity analysis for four case provinces, including two “red” provinces Shanxi and Heilongjiang, one “yellow” province Hubei and one “green” province Jiangsu. As illustrated in Figs. 7–10, the most sensitive factor is utilisation hour, and coal price and reduction in direct purchase tariff are next. For Shanxi province, the rating scale would change from “red to ”orange” with at least 15% increase in annual utilisation hour (500 h) (Fig. 7). However, it is almost impossible when considering the weak demand growth and large new projects under construction and planning (30 GW). For Heilongjiang province, the rating scale will change from “red” to “orange” with 5% reduction in coal price or 5% increase in annual utilisation hour (190 h) (Fig. 8). Though possible, the improvement is only marginal. For Hubei province, a 15% increase in annual utilisation hour (546 h) would change the rating scale from “yellow” to “green” (Fig. 9). But it requires a utilisation hour number higher than the 2015 level and seems unrealistic. A 15% reduction in coal price has a similar impact, but it seems impossible. For Jiangsu province, a 7.5% reduc- tion in utilisation hour (356 h) will change the rating from “green” to “yellow” (Fig. 10). Considering the change trend of annual utilisation hour in this province, we think this is highly possible. In short, sensitivity analysis on these case provinces indicates that the results of our projection are credible, and at least we do not overestimate the severity of the issue.
4. Conclusion and policy implications
The economic analysis reported in this paper has clearly indicated that the recent boom of coal power investment in China, which is absurd in many perspectives, is largely the aftermath of uncompleted market reform in the power sector. On the one hand, low coal price has pulled down the cost of power generation. On the other hand, the regulated on-grid tariffs, which are remarkably higher than the levelised cost of energy, provide strong economic motivation for investing in new projects. The decentralisation of project approval rights from central to provincial government catalyses the investment boom. However, though improper price regulation has provided a distorted economic signal, the fundamentals of electricity demand and supply are changing at a speed beyond the imagination of power generators and have foreboded coal power's gloomy prospect. For Chinese generators who are accustomed to price protection in the planning system, fierce competition in the electricity market is the new normal that they are not prepared for. In this regard, the 13th FYP capacity planning target for coal power is economically untenable and requires radical revision.
The first policy implication of our study is that NEA will need a more accurate economic alerting system to inform the power sector. The main pitfall of the existing system is that it is static rather than dynamic. It largely overlooks the impact of new projects on the annual utilisation hour. Another pitfall is that demand growth during the 13th FYP period could be overstated. A parallel suggestion is that NDRC should improve the work on generation cost estimating and timely adjust the on-grid tariff. It is important that before the functioning of the electricity market, NDRC should function properly on price regulation to properly signal the investment decision of power genera- tion projects.
The second policy implication is that a harder brake policy should be implemented to strictly regulate new capacity installation. For 16 provinces with “red” alert, it is strongly recommended that no new projects should be approved; all the projects under construction should be postponed, while all the pending projects should be cancelled. For seven provinces with “orange” alert, all the projects under construction should be postponed by 2018, and all the pending projects should be cancelled. For four provinces with “yellow” alert, strict control on the new projects is recommended to curb potential capacity excess.
The third implication is on power planning. Relevant national authorities are advised to work out power development planning adapted to the new economic normal as soon as possible. Such planning should facilitate low-carbon power sector transition, leave sufficient lead time for the completion of 20% non-fossil energy target by 2030 and rein the irrational growth of coal-fired power projects. In this regard, the recently issued 13th FYP planning target for coal power, 1100 GW by 2020 or 200 GW new installation, is incongruent with our microeconomic analysis. We thus strongly recommend formulating rolling planning and updating the capacity target for coal power.
Last but not least, speeding up the power market reform is the ultimate solution. Only real market competition may break the stub- born expectation of power generation enterprises on utilisation hour and on-grid tariff to gradually establish a truly market-oriented investment mechanism. It is advised that no annual generation quota for any new coal-fired power projects commissioned after 2016 will be approved, and all such projects should directly participate in the market. It is also advised that market reform should be steadily promoted in accordance with the established timetable. Besides, in the market reform process, the government should gradually rectify the negative externality of coal-fired power generation by operating an effective national carbon market, increasing pollution tax standards and others to provide a level playground for renewable energy development.

38,"The power industry reform in China 2015: Policies, evaluations and solutions","More than a decade ago, in China׳s electric power industry, the investment for generation side and power grids was inadequate and the gap between power supply and demand kept enlarging. In order to relief the problems above, power industry reform has been carried out in 2002 under the guidance of “No. 5 Document” by the Central Government. The reform in 2002 has made a series of achievements, including the enhancement of operation efficiency of power industry and the fulfillment of power demand all over the country. During the past decade, as the rapid development of the society and economy, the external environment of China׳s power industry has changed greatly. However, the pricing and planning mechanism of China׳s power industry still operates following the requirements of “No. 5 Document”, this has led to a number of problems including twisted pricing mechanism, irrational power system planning, inefficient utilization of renewable energy and so on. These problems have not only hindered the development of power industry in China for quite a long time, but also brought negative influence on the business operation of upstream and downstream industries. Therefore, Chinese government has issued “No. 9 Document” in 2015 and launched a new round of power industry reform. Policies were carried out to form new pricing mechanism, new policies about renewable energy generation and power system planning process to solve the problems mentioned above. This paper has reviewed the history of reform in 2002 and summarized the existing problems of China׳s power industry. Besides, the main policies of “No. 9 Document” were deeply analyzed, and their significance as well as backwards were illustrated. At last, solutions were proposed accordingly and these solutions have considerable theoretical and practical significance to China׳s electric power industry reform in the future.","1. Introduction
In the years around 2002, China's economy has experienced an enormous upswing, reflecting the country's emergence as a global economic superpower [1,2]. At the meantime, the rapidly expan- sion and development of all kinds of industries have led to a steep rise in power consumption of whole society. At that time, SPC (short for State Power Corporation), which is a government department and also state-owned enterprise, has an absolute monopoly of China's power sector. In that case, the operation efficiency of China's power industry is low and the investment for generation plants is insufficient, therefore the gap between power supply and demand kept enlarging [3]. In order to break the monopoly and to further develop the power industry, China's Central Government has issued No. 5 Government Document (hereinafter referred to No. 5 Document) to start the first round of power industry reform [4–6]. The power industry was separated into two parts: generation and power grids. To be specific, 5 large generation enterprises, several local generation enterprises and 2 grid enterprises were established. The electricity market on generation side was built and grid enterprises have to buy power from generation plants (these generation plants belong to 5 large generation enterprises or local generation enterprises) at on-grid price and sell them to users at the price of electricity [7].
The intention of these policies is to build a free market between the generation side and grid enterprises. However, expected results were not achieved through the reform in 2002, unfair competition phenomena kept emerging due to the lack of market participants(only 2 grid enterprises and generation plants belong to generation enterprises), the investment for power industry is still insufficient [8]. As it has been discussed in [9–12], actually, this result can be anticipated since these policies are not market- oriented, the government of China has carried out several administrative measures to put further regulation on the opera- tion of the market. Hence shortly after the reform, China's gov- ernment has decided that the on-grid price and the price of electricity would not be decided by the market but the NDRC (short for National Development and Reform Committee) [13,14]. So after the reform in 2002, the electricity market in China was again controlled by the government. As the generation enterprises and grid enterprises were all controlled by the government, in order to insure the benefit of these companies, government has to set a relatively high on-grid price and the price of electricity [15]. As it has been analyzed in relative studies, the cost of power consumption accounts for nearly 70% of the total cost of industrial users. Therefore, this pricing mechanism, along with the cross- subsidization mechanism, has invisibly increased the electricity cost of users, as it is illustrated in [16,17]. Users do not have chances to negotiate with generation plants and grid enterprises under this distorted pricing mechanism so there is no room for them to reduce their electricity cost. Since the production proce- dure of almost all kinds of industries is closely related with power consumption, the situation described above is not compatible with the rapid and healthy development of China's economy.
Besides, the external environment of China's power industry has changed greatly. For the purpose of environmental protection and to relief the smog phenomena, a large number of clean energy generation plants have recently been constructed [18,19]. The incentives of the investment for RE (short for renewable energy) generation were inspired by government policies especially sub- sidy policies, not market-oriented [20]. At the same time, the provincial power system planning was made by local government officials who are not professionals in power sector [21]. As a result, water spillage and wind curtailment persist due to integration challenges and irrational power system planning. All the problems above go against the future development of China's power industry, and have brought negative influences to upstream and downstream industries. As it is concluded in [22,23], the external environment were greatly changed during 2002–2015, more policies were required to make the power industry more adapted to the changes.
In order to solve the problems described above, China's Central Government has carried out a new round of power industry reform by the “No. 9 Government Document” (hereinafter referred to No. 9 Document). This paper will introduce the main content of “No. 9 Document” and assess the effect of this document as well as proposing solutions in the future. The second part of this article will review the history of power industry reform of China; the development status and existing problems of China's power industry, which are actually resulted from the power industry reform in 2002, will be described in the third section; the fourth part will give detailed policies of “No. 9 Document”, which is the key government document of China's power industry reform in 2015; the fifth part of this paper will analyze relative policies and propose some suggestions. This paper will end with some con- clusions about the development of China's power industry reform. The logical linkage of different sections in the paper is illustrated in Fig. 1.
2. The power industry reform in China 2002
The first round of China's power industry reform dates back to 2002. At that time, China's power industry was fully controlled by SPC, and government departments are responsible for making relative policies and supervising the operation of power system [24–27,29]. The structure of power industry in China before 2002 is shown in Table 1.
Under the monopoly mode, a series of problems have been occurred to China's power industry. The most serious problems are as follows:
Power industry lacks investment for generation side and power grids, unable to meet the power demand.
The power grids were weak (especially in rural area), part of users in rural area cannot get access to power grids.
The power grids are unable to handle disasters and accidents. Due to the negative influences brought by problems above,
Chinese government has issued Power Industry Reforms 2002 (So called No. 5 Document) to break the monopoly and introduce market competition to improve the operation of power industry [28]. The policies of No. 5 Document are as follows:
The power industry was separated into two parts: generation and power grids. Generation part was further separated into 5 generation enterprises and some local generation enterprises, including (China Huaneng Group, China Huadian Corporation, China Guodian Corporation, China Datang Corporation, China Power Investment Corporation and some local enterprises). Meanwhile the grid part was separated into 2 grid enterprises: SGCC (Short for State Grid Corporation of China) and CSG (Short for China Southern Power Grid Company Limited). CSG controls the power grid operation of Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou. SGCC is responsible for the operation of power grids in other provinces [28]. The separation of China's power industry in 2002 is shown in Fig. 2.
The pricing mechanism of power industry has changed greatly: the grid enterprises buy power from generation plants at on- grid price and sell them to the users at the price of electricity. Initially, generation plants have to compete with each other and sell power to grid enterprises. The negotiation is between generation plants and grid enterprises. However, the market was controlled by five large generation enterprises and two grid companies, the participants are so few that the phenomena of unfair competition were serious during the operation of power industry. Therefore, the pricing mechanism has changed again: the on-grid price was decided by NDRC. The price of electricity is decided and separated into different categories (for agricul- tural users, industrial users and so on) by the NDRC either. The gap between the on-grid price and the price of electricity is the transmission and distribution price and government funds, government funds are determined by the NDRC either. The main income of grid enterprises is transmission and distribution price and local governments get the government funds [28]. The price structure of power industry after 2002 in China is shown in Fig. 3.
The administrative approval of generation projects and grid construction projects belong to NDRC.
SERC (short for State Electricity Regulatory Commission) was established to supervise the trans-regional power transaction, policy making and implementation.
The responsibilities of other government departments remain the same.
It has been 13 years since the reform in 2002, summarized from the development status of power industry after 2002, No. 5 docu- ment has accomplished the following achievements:
The investment for generation plants and power grids kept increasing steadily.
Much more users were able to get access to power grids espe- cially in rural area.
The reliability of power grids has been significantly improved. For example, power grids were able to restore power supply shortly after the earthquake in Sichuan Wenchuan and Yunnan Ludian.
Although several accomplishments were made after the reform in 2002, but most professionals of China's power industry still consider No. 5 Document as a failure: some old questions were still unsolved while many new questions kept emerging [30]. In the next section, the main problems of China's power industry after 2002 will be discussed.

3. The existing problems of China's electric power industry
After the reform of 2002, a large quantity of problems kept emerging during the following decade. To reduce redundancy, we will be listing the main problems of China's power industry in the following sections from four aspects. The problems described in Sections 3.1–3.4 are of great urgency and we have reasons to believe that theses problems are the main cause to other obstacles which have hindered the reform process of China's power industry.
3.1. Distorted pricing mechanism
The pricing mechanism of China's power industry became seriously distorted after the reform in 2002. As it is explained in Section 2, grid enterprises buy power from generation plants at on-grid price and sell them to the users at the price of electricity. The on-grid price and the price of electricity were all decided by NDRC [31]. The production and consumption process of China's power industry is shown in Fig. 4.
In a word, the price was not decided by market participants but the government. Before a generation plant was built, the genera- tion enterprises will submit the economic indexes of this project to NDRC. Then a negotiation will be carried out between NDRC and this generation enterprise to decide the on-grid price of this generation plant. The process of this pricing mechanism is shown in Fig. 5.
During the past decade, NDRC was not able to set a reasonable price due to their lack of professional expertize in electric power system (the officials of NDRC were not professionals in power sector). Chinese government has to keep the benefit of generation enterprises and grid enterprises because they are all state-owned. Therefore generation plants can always get a high on-grid price after negotiation. The unreasonable income will finally be paid by the users since the price of electricity is also decided by NDRC. This has led to the irrational investment of generation side (deeper reason of irrational investment will be discussed in Section 3.2). Besides, the cross-subsidization problem in China is also serious. Industrial users have to pay more than agricultural users and residents [32,33]. Therefore the pricing mechanism, which is not market-oriented and objective, has hindered electricity market reform in China for quite a long time.
Efforts have been made by Chinese government to reduce the negative effect caused by pricing mechanism. The Chinese gov- ernment has started to carry out policies about DPLU (short for “direct power-purchase for large users”) since 2002 in order to solve this problem in a more market-oriented way. This policy, which will form direct negotiations between large users and generation plants to determine the electricity price, has made some progress in promoting the market-oriented reform in China. As a result, during the implementation, the on-grid price after bilateral negotiation was lower than the on-grid price under the former pricing mechanism, which proves that it is possible for users to reduce their electricity cost under market-oriented mechanism. For more details about DPLU, please see [34].
3.2. Lack of clear understanding of external environment
The most important reason to the failure of No. 5 Document is the significant external environment change of China's power industry after No. 5 Document [35–37]. There are large deviations between the predictions and reality about the development of power industry made by Chinese government, among those, the most influential one should be the inaccurate estimation of China's power and energy consumption.
After the reform in 2002, Chinese government has increased the investment for generation side and power grids. During the following decade, the generation capacity of China kept growing, China actually surpassed the U.S. as the world's top electric power producer in 2013 [38,39]. The power supply and demand of China during 2003–2014 is shown in Fig. 6, the generation capacity and investment for grid construction in China is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8.
As it is shown in the figures above, the power demand of whole country is basically fulfilled after the reform in 2002. The situation that power demand exceeds supply is rare in China after 2008. Actually, generation capacity is redundant nowadays [40]. The utilization hours started to decrease sharply since 2008, which means it is irrational to increase investment for generation side as proposed by No. 5 Document [41]. However, Chinese government (NDRC, to be specifically), ignored the present situation and induced generation enterprises to invest more on generation plants. At the same time, generation enterprises are willingly to develop more generation plants as it is illustrated in Section 1 (Generation enterprises are all controlled by Chinese government, in order to keep the benefit of these state owned enterprises, NDRC is tend to set high on-grid price). Therefore the utilization hours of generation plants in China kept declining since 2008, to some provinces like Yunnan and Guizhou, it is nearly 2500. The variation tendency of utilization hours for China's generation plants is shown in Fig. 9.
3.3. Inefficient utilization of renewable energy
With the increasing serious air pollution, Chinese government has issued Renewable Energy Law in 2006. Since then a large quantity of RE generation plants have been constructed and put into operation [42–44]. Among those, there is rapid growth in the investment for wind power generation and photovoltaic genera- tion especially in the northwest region of China, which is rich in wind and solar energy. The generation capacity of wind power generation and photovoltaic generation during 2005–2014 is shown in Figs. 10 and 11.
As it is illustrated in the figures above, the generation capacity of wind power generation and photovoltaic generation has increased dramatically during 2005–2014. Now these RE genera- tion plants are faced with integration challenges [45,46]. These challenges were partly caused by the “priority dispatched mechanism”: The power grids are reluctant to by the RE generation (this reason is closely related with the obscure position of grid enterprises, which will be analyzed in Section 3.4).
The dispatch center, which belongs to the grid enterprises in China, prefers to dispatch coal-fired generation in priority since it is more flexible and controllable during the dispatch process. Besides, along with the integration of RE generation, dispatch center will have to relief their negative influence on power system operation through the optimal unit commitment between RE generation and coal-fired generation [62].
If power system accepts certain amount of RE generation, due to their instability and intermittency, coal-fired generation will have to change their output frequently and increase their operating cost, hence few coal-fired generation plants are will- ing to provide peaking service for RE generation.
What is more, the local government officials, who are respon- sible for making the power system planning, ignore the intermittency and randomness of generation output of RE generation plants, so there is inadequate generation capacity to provide peaking service in RE-abundant areas. 
Therefore the phenomena like wind curtailment is becoming serious, and the utilization hours of wind generation is low in recent years, as it is shown in Fig. 12.
At the same time, the northwest region of China has affluent RE like wind and solar, however the power demand in northwest region is low. On the contrary, the power demand of eastern region is high as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore the power generated from RE in northwest region must be transmitted to eastern region to consume, this would be another reason of problems like wind curtailment. 3.4. The obscure responsibility of grid enterprises
The SGCC and CSG are still unclear about their responsibility in China's power industry. As state owned enterprises, SASAC (short for State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the state council) assesses and evaluates the business operation of SGCC and CSG every year. The main evaluation indicators are profits and power consumption [46]. This evaluation system has led SGCC and CSG to guide users to increase their power consumption in order to achieve higher profit. Besides, the grid enterprises undertake the power dispatching function in China's power industry (the grid enterprises control the dispatch center). Grid enterprises can let the generation plants with low on-grid price to generate more power and sell them to users while repressing those with high on-grid price. The gap between average on-grid price and the price of electricity is enlarged, grid enterprises can earn more by doing this. Due to the high operation cost (which will lead to high marginal cost) of RE generation plants, their on-grid prices are higher than coal-fired generation as shown Table 1. Therefore the grid enterprises are reluctant to buy RE generation and dispatch center does not give RE generation “dispatch priority”. But as an important part of power industry, which also acquires the char- acteristics of utilities, SGCC and CSG undertake significant social responsibilities like power grid operation safety, RE generation integration, power grid construction in rural area, cross- subsidization and so on. It is obviously a contradiction between the evaluation process of SGCC and CSG and their social responsibilities.
In recent years, in order to promote energy conservation, SASAC has made energy conservation as one of the indicators to evaluate the business operation of SGCC and CSG. It is called “Double 0.3%”. To be specifically, SGCC and CSG have to promote demand side management positively and annual users’ power consumption saving has to be higher than the 0.3% of last year's power consumption. Besides, the load reduction of these users is supposed to be higher than 0.3% of their annual peak load [46]. These new indicators are actually hard to evaluate, and are obviously contradictive to the existing indicators. This contra- diction has led to serious outcomes: SGCC and CSG cannot operate neither like ordinary commercial enterprises or utilities. 4. Policies for power industry reform of China in 2015
Chinese government has realized the present problems of power industry. A government document named Relative Policies on Deepening the Reform of Power Industry (the so called No. 9 Document) was issued by the Sate Council on March 25th, 2015. No. 9 Document has released specific policies for power industry reform in 2015. The following sections will give the details of these policies.
4.1. Reform of pricing mechanism of power industry
Pricing mechanism reform is of great significance in No. 9 Document, as follows:
First, transaction price will replace the former on-grid price and it will be decided by the market between generation plants and users. Generation plants will sell power to grid enterprises at transaction price, which is decided by the negotiation between generation plants and users. Therefore, the price of electricity for users consists three parts: transaction price, transmission and distribution price, government funds. It is worth noting that only users with high annual power consumption can participate in this market. We can treat this market as the expansion of DPLU [34].
Second, not all users have access to the market mentioned above. Therefore, power retailers are encouraged to be established. The retailers can gather together the users which are not qualified to participate in DPLU to make a “large user” and participate in the market. Hence users like resident users and agricultural users now can choose to buy power from retailers or follow the former pri- cing mechanism (Under the former pricing mechanism, the price of electricity for them is low, if they choose retailers, they have to burden the risk brought by retail market). This separation of market can help guarantee the improvement of people's liveli- hoods and realize universal service in power industry.
Third, transmission and distribution price are separated. Under the new pricing mechanism, only transmission and distribution price and government funds are decided by NDRC. NDRC will determine the transmission and distribution price according to the investment and operation cost of power grids. The whole evalua- tion process is supposed to be revealed to the society [48,49].
4.2. Reform of power industry planning mechanism
No. 9 Document has proposed that the authority of power system planning still belongs to local governments. Local govern- ments should carry out power system planning according to local conditions [48]. However, the irrational planning problems were mainly caused by the unprofessional planning schemes. It seems that the No. 9 Document misses its chances to solve this problem. Relative recommendations will be discussed in Section 5.2.
The power system planning between provinces should be coordinated either. Evaluation for environmental influence should be carried out before power system planning. The problems of RE generation integration are supposed to be solved through two solutions: enhancing the comprehensiveness and rationality of power system planning and power system operation mechanism.
First of all, the optimal coordination between multiple gen- eration resources and power grids should be taken into con- sideration during the planning process. Local governments should do field investigation and choose the suitable place as well as the optimal capacity of RE generation plants. Besides, the relative flexible and controllable generation resources like coal-fired gen- eration plants and gas-fired power plants should be built accord- ingly in order to provide peaking service of RE generation.
Secondly, dispatch center should give dispatch priorities to RE generation during the dispatch process. In order to insure the stable system operation, the optimal combination between RE generation and flexible generation resources will be given the first priority and RE generation (which needs the peaking service from coal-fired generation) will be given the second priority. The main mission of dispatch center is to find the optimal unit commitment between RE generation and coal-fired generation when making the day-ahead dispatch scheme and real-time dispatch process. When making the dispatch plan, dispatch center should first consider whether it fulfills the safety requirements. The optimal system planning is ought to provide basis for the dispatch priority mechanism for RE generation. Since the dispatch priority mechanism can operate smoothly only when there is enough capacity for peaking service.
4.3. The promotion of renewable generation utilization
Several policies about promoting the utilization of RE genera- tion were carried out in No. 9 Document.
First, the utilization of RE generation should be enhanced from provincial and trans-regional levels. For regions which are abun- dant in RE, local governments should encourage users to consume RE generation. At the same time, surplus power generated by RE generation plants will be transmitted to eastern regions through transmission lines. Provinces in eastern regions should consume RE generation preferentially. For example, Guangdong should consume the wind power generation of Guizhou province pre- ferentially [49].
Second, RE generation plants are encouraged to take part in the market and negotiate with users. In order to reduce the negative influence brought by RE generation, an optimal combination between coal-fired power generation and RE generation is encouraged to participate in the market. Subsidizations are sup- posed to give to these coal-fired power plants for providing peaking service for RE generation plants [48].
Third, demand side management should be further promoted. A coordination between power consumption (especially industrial users) and RE generation should be realized. For example, the generation output of wind power generation in Inner Mongolia is high during 19 p.m. to 21 p.m., therefore industrial users are encouraged to increase their production during that time period in order to consume wind power.
4.4. Repositioning of grid enterprises
No. 9 Document has published following policies about the future development of grid enterprises:
First, the business operation and profit mode of grid enterprises will be changed. Under the new pricing mechanism, grid enter- prises are supposed to earn transmission and distribution price as their main source of income. The income of grid enterprises is determined by Chinese government by setting the transmission and distribution price. Therefore grid enterprises will have no reason to enlarge the gap between on-grid price and the price of electricity since their income is fixed [50].
Second, grid enterprises are supposed to promote the demand side management in the future. Grid enterprises should develop modern information technologies and help users to further improve their energy efficiency.
5. Policy evaluations and suggestions
Overall, No. 9 Document has proposed respondent solutions to the most critical problems in China's power industry. Still, No. 9 Document has some flaw. It is worth noting that No.9 Document is just a beginning, relative policies are supposed publish in the following months. In the next sections, an analysis will be given according to the policies in No. 9 Document and several solutions will be derived. The analysis includes five aspects accordingly: pricing mechanism, power system planning, utilization of RE, new position of grid enterprises and legislation.
5.1. Pricing mechanism
The pricing mechanism is about to be changed greatly after the publication of No. 9 Document, the price of electricity and former on-grid price will be decided by the market instead of NDRC. As it is written in No. 9 Document, large users can now negotiate with generation plants directly to determine the transaction price. Obviously it is an expansion of DPLU, so we call it e-DPLU. Hence in the future, the electricity market in China will be separated into 2 parts: e-DPLU and retail market.
As for e-DPLU, No. 9 Document has proposed that large users are encouraged to negotiate with generation plants to decide the transaction price of generation plants. Besides, transmission and distribution price as well as government funds are decided by NDRC. The price structure of e-DPLU is shown in Fig. 14. e-DPLU has the potential to operate similarly to wholesale electricity market in U.S. [51–53]. The procedure of e-DPLU is as follows:
First, direct negotiations will be formed between large users and generation plants, the negotiation result (transaction price) will be the on-grid price for generation plants. The power consumption and price are included in the bilateral contracts between large users and generation plants. These contracts are long-term contracts (monthly contracts are the shortest con- tract period).
Second, for those large users who don't want to participate in the negotiations (or fail to negotiate with generation plants), they can bid through the electricity trade center and find the potential possible supplier. The bilateral contracts are long-term contracts like direct negotiations.
Third, a regulation market will be built to deal with the fluc- tuation of transaction results.
However, the e-DPLU contracts are not surrounded by a thriv- ing ecosystem of hedging instruments, which is different from the bilateral contracts of U.S.. At the same time, all U.S. market operators use LMPs, Financial Transmission Rights, and security-constrained economic dispatch. China's dispatch centers belong to grid enterprises, so the dispatch centers will use LMPs, security- constrained economic dispatch and other tools to minimize their operation cost rather than the cost of whole system. Financial Transmission Rights and other financial tools are not mentioned in No. 9 Document since it is just the initial stage of China's elec- tricity market.
As for the retail market, power retailers are supposed to be established. Therefore users with low annual power consumption now have two choices: the former pricing mechanism and power retailers. For users like residents and agricultural users, they are more likely to choose the former pricing mechanism since they are offered low price (The low price for these users under the former pricing mechanism is critical to insure the basic livelihood of citizens). Other users are more likely to choose retailers, the price structure of retailers is shown in Fig. 15.
In a word, this policy is innovative and seems compatible with China's power industry development situation. Compared with the market in 2002 (negotiation was between generation enterprises and grid enterprises), the participants are much more since the trading negotiation after reform 2015 is supposed to be hold between generation plants and users. The market was separated into three parts, all kinds of users can choose the suitable sellers now. The only problem remains that if most residential and agri- cultural users choose to buy power under the former pricing mechanism, no one will pay for the cross-subsidization since all industrial users are more likely to take part in the e-DPLU (In fact, they are suppose to pay the cross-subsidization under the former pricing mechanism). Under the present situation, it is reasonable to let the industrial users to pay the cross-subsidization through their transmission and distribution price. We can set higher price for industrial users and lower price for other users to achieve that [37].
After the reform in 2015, the electricity market structure in China will be significantly changed, see Fig. 16.
After the No. 9 Document was published, e-DPLU has been put into implementation in several provinces, Yunnan was the first one to carry out such practice. As shown in [34], the on-grid price has reduced 0.0165–0.164 Yuan/kW h. Therefore, there is room for users to reduce their electricity cost when they are given chances to negotiate with other market participants and the electricity price under the former pricing mechanism is relatively high compared with market-oriented price.
5.2. Power system planning
The power system planning mechanism has been significantly changed after No. 9 Document. There will be 2 ways to rationalize the power system planning, including:
First, market-oriented measures. Due to the reasons mentioned above, generation plants can always get a high on-grid price before No. 9 Document. After the reform, the on-grid price will be replaced by transaction price and determined by the market between generation plants and users. The generation capacity of China is redundant and we can anticipate that the electricity market in China will be the buyer's market. Conclusions can be made form the transaction results from the implementation of DPLU that the average transaction price is lower than the former on-grid price. Therefore the profit earned by generation enter- prises through developing new generation plants will decrease [54,55]. This will partly relief the blindly investment situation of generation side.
Second, administrative measures. No. 9 Document has pro- posed that local governments are still responsible for power sys- tem planning. Hence local governments can make and perform power system planning according to local conditions.
However, No. 9 document did not give the details about how to improve the rationality of power system planning. Power system is different from other utilities, the whole process of “generation- power transmission and distribution-power consumption” should be finished simultaneously. If not, blackout accidents, like what happened in India and California, will happen and bring serious effects to the development of various industries. Therefore, deci- sions about power system planning must be treated seriously. However, officials in either NDRC or local governments are lack of professional knowledge in power system [54,57]. If government officials are still responsible for the power system planning, the irrational planning problem continues. Hence the key to rationa- lize power system planning is to enhance its professionalism.
We suggest that Power System Planning Committee (herein- after referred to PSPC) of Central Government and local govern- ments should be established. The members of PSPC is ought to be chosen from grid enterprises, generation plants, government and users. Local and national PSPC are responsible for the local and national power system planning and supervise the system operation. Once PSPC and relative mechanism were established and responsible for system planning making, the professionalism of power industry will be greatly enhanced.
For one thing, Central PSPC are supposed to be controlled by the State Council, besides, Central PSPC should take part in the formulation process of National Economic and Social Development Plan (like 11th Five-Year Plan, 12th Five-Year Plan and the coming 13th Five-Year Plan). Due to the distribution of power supply resources and power demand (see Fig. 17), a national power sys- tem planning is needed and all local power system planning should be made according to the national planning.
Local PSPC will formulate detail planning schemes according to local conditions and national planning. The planning schemes should be submitted to Central PSPC and local governments. The schemes can be put into implementation when they are approved by both sides. The process mentioned above is shown in Fig. 18.
Besides, the system operation process should be optimized based on rationalized power system planning. As discussed in Section 4.2, the capacity of flexible generation resources is ade- quate through rational power system planning and the optimal combination between RE generation and flexible generation resources is supposed to be given the dispatch priority. The reliability requirements, safety requirements, and economic requirements should be taken into consideration when making day-ahead and real-time dispatch schemes. An evaluation process should be carried out to evaluate each dispatch scheme by dis- patch center: first, evaluation index system including wind power curtailment, photovoltaic generation curtailment, RE generation output and other indexes should be built; second, the dispatch center choose the suitable comprehensive evaluation method and build the statistic model; Third, dispatch center performs the evaluation process and decide the optimal dispatch scheme. PSPC will supervise this whole scheme-making process and make sure that the dispatch scheme is fair and unprejudiced.
Last but not least, the planning for generation side and power grids should be coordinated and PSPC is supposed to make the planning scheme accordingly. For one thing, when making local planning, grid planning should be designed to be more flexible and accommodate more RE generation (distributed or centralized). Advanced technologies like active distribution network and flex- ible alternative current transmission will contribute to enhancing the flexibility of power grids. For another, due to the distribution of RE resources in China, the national planning of power grids should further put RE generation transmission across the country as the primary consideration, which means UHV (short for ultra- high voltage) transmission technology and demand side response technologies are needed. Besides, the national and local power system planning should be coordinated. On the one hand, local system planning is ought to be compatible with national planning, on the other hand, present and future characteristics of local system planning should be taken into consideration when making national planning.
5.3. Utilization of renewable energy
No. 9 Document still treats the efficient utilization of RE gen- eration as one of the most important tasks. A series of policies were proposed including encouraging RE generation plants to participate in the DPLU. However, the solutions in No. 9 Document alone are not able to solve these problems. As shown in Table 2, the on-grid price of RE generation is higher than coal-fired gen- eration under the former pricing mechanism. According to the actual situation in China's power industry, though the former pricing mechanism is not market-oriented, the on-grid price gap somehow illustrates that the operation cost of RE generation is higher compared with coal-fired generation and has led to higher marginal cost so they lack competitiveness in the electricity mar- ket. Besides, under the present dispatch scheme, few flexible generation plants are willing to provide peaking service for RE generation in China. Therefore, RE generation lacks market com- petitiveness. Hence the market-oriented reform policies in No. 9 Document may make the problems about RE generation become even worse [56]. According to this solution and dispatch solutions mentioned in 5.2, government has to introduce users to RE gen- eration and guarantee their basic business operation.
Therefore, we suggest to promote the utilization of RE gen- eration through the following solutions: Independent Market and Carbon Emissions Standards (hereinafter referred to IM solution and CES solution).
IM was described in detail in [34]. Government can pick some users in the market to consume the power generated from RE. These users should be able to bear low power quality so some users which requires high precision or high techniques should be eliminated. Besides, some coal-fired power generation plants have to provide peaking service for these users to reduce the negative influence caused by the randomness and intermittency of RE generation. Hence the coal-fired power generation and RE gen- eration are bundled together and sold to this part of users. Obviously the electricity cost of these users will rise, so sub- sidization may be needed. This solution has been put into imple- mentation in Yunnan province [34]. Once this solution is imple- mented, the market structure will be changed greatly, as illu- strated in Fig. 19. This solution will provide the basic market space of RE generation.
However, RE generation's poor competitiveness are just partly influenced by the randomness and high operation cost. A number of technical studies (Renewable Electricity Futures, grid integra- tion studies) have overcome these obstacles as well as realized (Denmark, Portugal, Spain, TX, CA, and many other locations). Government and organizations have already put some of the advanced technologies or mechanism into practice, however the fact is that the higher operation cost and randomness still made RE generation less competitive in China's electricity market [62–66]. Therefore China's government, relative organizations and research institutes should make their best endeavors to find the suitable mechanism (which is adaptive to the present situation of China's power industry) as well as developing advanced RE generation integration technologies.
Another solution is CES (short for Carbon Emission Standards). A standard for carbon and pollution emission should be set and those whose emission exceeds the standard will have to pay the penalty. In order to further promote the CES, a CET (short for Carbon Emission Trading) mechanism should be carried out. In CET, once generation plants have exceeded their standards, they have to buy it from other generation plants which are lower than their standards. Once CES and CET were put into implementation, the environmental cost for coal-fired power generation will rise and it is another way to enhance the competitiveness of RE gen- eration, since they are more environment-friendly. At the same time, the electricity market participants will be driven to develop RE generation or coal-fired power generation with low carbon emission. However, coal-fired power generation accounts for 70% of China's total generation capacity. If the cost of coal-fired power generation rises, it may lead to the rise of electricity cost of users from all aspects of society. But from another point of view, users and generation plants have paid for environment protection together. Under the situation that smog is becoming serious in China and environmental protection awareness of the whole society continues to improve, CES and CET seem quite acceptable for users and generation plants.
Solutions mentioned above are market-oriented ways to pro- mote the utilization of RE. Another way to achieve that is the coordinated power system planning. On one hand, during the process of power system planning, PSPC of all levels should guide generation enterprises and grid enterprises to invest in both RE generation, flexible coal-fired power generation and flexible power girds. Hence during the operation of power system, these coal-fired power plants with high flexibility will provide peaking service for RE generation. On the other hand, demand side man- agement (DSM) in China should be further promoted, subjects of DSM implementation (like government, grid enterprises and power retailers in the future) should guide the power load of users to follow the generation pattern of RE generation. With the coor- dination of both sides (generation and users), an optimization process aiming at consuming RE generation will be built. Besides, grid construction should be further promoted to transfer the power generated from RE generation plants of northwest regions to east regions. Several UHV transmission lines have been con- structed and put into operation. UHV transmission lines are able to transfer the power generated from wind energy in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia to Beijing, Shandong and other eastern regions [58,59]. After No. 9 Document, UHV lines will be further devel- oped, the UHV lines in China and future planning are demon- strated in Fig. 20.
5.4. Redefinition of responsibilities of grid enterprises
Before No. 9 Document, all users buy power from grid enter- prises and electricity price are all decided by NDRC. After No. 9 Document, only part of users (like residents and agricultural users) will buy power from grid enterprises. No. 9 Document also pointed out that SASAC will no longer evaluate the operation of grid enterprises by the indicators like profit and power con- sumption. At the same time, No. 9 Document also put forward that demand side management should be the main task of grid enter- prises. However, No. 9 Document didn't tell the evaluation indi- cators and future development direction of grid enterprises [60].
Therefore, we suggest that grid enterprises should be defined as utilities. Grid enterprises should insure the safe and stable operation of power grids and undertake the responsibility of universal service of power industry. Grid enterprises should help users to improve the way of power consumption and enhance their energy efficiency [61]. The main indicators for the evaluation of grid enterprises should be the demand side management and energy efficiency enhancement of users.
5.5. Legislation
As we can conclude from the successful power industry reform of other countries, the reform policies are always supported by relative laws. The most important laws in China for power industry are Power Industry Law and Renewable Energy Law of the People's Republic of China, however they were all drafted more than a decade ago. Therefore revisions for the laws above are needed to support the implementation of No. 9 Document. Here we will propose our suggestion for law revision.
First, relative power industry reform policies of No. 9 Docu- ment should be added into Power Industry Law, including pricing mechanism reform and power system planning mechanism reform and so on.
Second, legal obligations of energy conservation and environ- mental protection of both users and generation plants should be written in the Power Industry Law.
Third, Renewable Energy Law of the People’s Republic of China should be revised, solutions mentioned in No. 9 Document and Section 5.3 should be added.
Fourth, the responsibilities of grid enterprises should be rede- fined in the Power Industry Law, and new evaluation system for grid enterprises which focus on enhancing users’ energy efficiency and demand side management should be emphasized.
6. Conclusions
The power industry reform in 2002 (No. 5 Document) has solved several urgent problems, but some policies of No. 5 Docu- ment was not fully implemented due to the lack of executive ability. During the past decade, the external environment has been changing rapidly while the reform policies remain unaltered. Therefore several problems have occurred to the future develop- ment of China's power industry, including distorted pricing mechanism, efficient utilization of RE and so on. In order to solve these problems, Chinese government has issued a new round of power industry reform in March 2015 (No. 9 Document). This paper has reviewed the history of China's power industry reform and summarized the reform policies of No. 9 Document. Several suggestions were proposed at last.
No. 9 Document has published respondent reform policies from the following aspects: pricing mechanism, power system planning mechanism, promotion of RE generation and repositioning of grid enterprises. First, the former pricing mechanism, which on-grid price and the price of electricity were decided by NDRC will be replaced by more market-oriented ways. Direct negotiation will be held between users and generation plants to determine the transaction price to replace the former on-grid price. Second, the irrational power system planning mechanism will be changed; third, the efficient utilization of RE generation should be further promoted. Last but not least, the function and role of grid enter- prises will be redefined.
At the same time, this paper has proposed several suggestions in order to facilitate the process of reform. First, the structure of electricity market should be changed to improve people's liveli- hoods and realize universal service in the power industry. Second, local and national PSPC should be established to make and per- form power system planning. Third, the efficiency of RE generation is ought to be improved by IM, CES solutions as well as rational power system planning. Fourth, Chinese government should recognize grid enterprises as utilities and modify the evaluation indicators for them. Last but not least, all reform policies should be strengthened through law revision.
The suggestions mentioned above are of great theoretical and practical significance. In fact, some solutions have been put into implementation in Yunnan province. It is important to highlight that the reform policies should be supported by relative laws. All solutions are ought to be added into Power Industry Law and other related laws. Only in this way can the reform of No. 9 Document achieve expected results. Future research will consider the even- tual settlement of cross-subsidization issues among different categories of users. Besides, subsidies and other problems about independent market are worth intensive study.

39,To what extent will China's ongoing electricity market reforms assist the integration of renewable energy?,"Poor renewable energy (RE) integration is posing a huge challenge to China's electricity sector. This paper examines the extent to which China's power sector reforms will assist RE integration, and issues to effective implementation. It demonstrates that a well-established electricity market could provide practical solutions to RE integration challenge. China's existing power sector regime heavily regulated by administrative planning constrains RE integration. The on-going electricity reforms (new reforms) in the country such as the transmission and distribution (T&D) tariff reform, the direct trading of electricity, among others, along with new RE policies such as full purchase of guaranteed RE generation and green certificate system, should assist RE integration in the country. However, there are a number of implementation challenges such as the intervention from local governments in direct electricity trades and the lack of a quota system for RE, among others. If these challenges are not properly addressed, the potential positive impacts of the new reforms on RE integration will be undermined. It is recommended that the central government strengthen top-level design and supervision, design and build up electricity spot markets, push forward the regional electricity markets, and facilitate the establishment of a renewable quota system.","1. Introduction
Since China's Renewable Energy Law took effect on 1st January 2006, wind and solar power have witnessed tremendous growth in both installed capacity and generation. The cumulative installed capacity increased from 1.06 GW in 2005–148.64 GW in 2016 for wind power, and from 70 MW in 2005–77.42 GW in 2016 for solar power. Meanwhile, their shares in China's total electricity generation increased from 0.065% in 2005 to 4.02% in 2016 for wind power, and from a negligible percentage in 2006 to 1% in 2016 for solar power (CNREC, 2015; CEC, 2006, 2017).
Along with this unprecedented growth, renewable energy (RE) in- tegration has posed a serious challenge. Large-scale wind curtailment first emerged in 2009 in Inner Mongolia, and spread nationwide in 2010. During the period 2011–2015, the national average wind cur- tailment rate was 15% (Zhang, 2016). The key region for wind cur- tailment is China's ‘Three Norths’ Region (North China, Northeast China and Northwest China), typically in Gansu, Xinjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia where wind curtailment rates were 43%, 38%, 30% and 21% in 2016 (NEA, 2017a). Total wind energy abandoned in 2015 and 2016 was 33.9 TWh and 49.7 TWh respectively (Zhang, 2016; NEA, 2017a). Solar PV curtailment emerged in 2013. The national average curtail- ment rate of solar PV during the period 2013–2016 was around 15%, and total solar energy abandoned was 14.19 TWh (Greenpeace, 2017). The key curtailment region for solar PV curtailment was Northwest China, including Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia and Qinghai (Greenpeace, 2017).
The increasing curtailment of renewable energy has aroused great concern from government agencies, the RE industry as well as aca- demics across the country. Our literature review shows that there are a number of studies on the causes of China's wind energy curtailment or poor integration. The main factors identified by these studies include the geographical mismatch between wind- and solar-resources abun- dant provinces and load centers, the inflexible generation mix domi- nated by coal-fired power, the misalignment of transmission capacity and wind farms and large scale solar stations, the lack of energy sto- rage, as well as the recent slow growth of power demand (Kahrl and Wang, 2015; Luo et al., 2016; Xiong, 2016; Zhao et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Yin, 2017).
important though these physical factors are, the roots of China's renewable energy curtailment lie in China's unique electricity sector regime governed by planned economy institutions that has led to the lack of flexibility in generation, operation, pricing and demand neces- sary to integrate renewable energy. The recent publications of Regulatory Assistance Project(RAP) and the International Energy Agency(IEA) have presented in-depth analyses on the crucial institu- tional challenges facing China's electricity sector. Cheung (2011) and Kahrl et al. (2011) argued that the rigidity of China's electricity sector regime runs counter to the flexibility requirement for accommodating intermittent renewables, and that it was essential for the electricity market evolve gradually to enhance RE integration. Key deficiencies relate to dispatch, pricing, ancillary services and inter-provincial trading. Kahrl and Wang (2014) held that China's approach to dispatch is one of the major reasons for the large amounts of RE curtailment. Dispatch continues to be carried out on the basis of plans developed at local level and designed to address local economic priorities, a practice which undermines the dispatch of renewable energy (Kahrl and Wang (2015). Pricing for both wholesale and retail power remains under the control of the central government, which fails to provide incentives for flexibility on the part of generators and end-users (Depuy, 2015; RAP, 2008). The application of administrative rather than economic me- chanisms for the procurement of ancillary services has led to the under- supply of these services (Pollitt et al., 2017) and the influence of pro- vincial governments over the power system has hindered the inter- provincial electricity trading (Pollitt et al., 2017; Dupuy, 2016). Building on their examination of China's grid company regulations, Dupuy et al. (2015) and Crossley (2015) concluded that the lack of incentives for the grid companies to search for solutions to reduce curtailment is another institutional reason for wind integration pro- blem.
In summary, the existing literature on the institutional barriers to RE integration have provided an understanding of how China's current institutions and practices within the electricity sector have constrained the integration of RE. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies on the likely impacts of China's new electricity market re- forms (‘new reforms’) launched in March 2015 on RE integration in the country. This paper seeks to fill this gap. To this end, the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents a theoretical analysis of the relevance of electricity market to RE integration into the power system. Section 3 identifies the institutional barriers to the RE in- tegration in China. The subsequent section summarizes the main ele- ments of China's new reforms, as well as new RE integration policies pertinent to the new reforms. Section 5 examines the main challenges facing the new reforms and the new RE integration policies. Building on these analysis, policy implications are provided in Section 6. The last section presents conclusions.
2. Theoretical analysis: Relevance of electricity market to RE integration
Like any other commodity, electricity can be traded in markets, and used in any quantity. Yet, a number of features distinguish it from other commodities: it can only be stored to a very limited extent in a com- mercially viable way and must be consumed immediately it is gener- ated; and, as a result, its supply must exactly meet demand at any given time across the grid. In a wholesale electricity market, commodities traded include not only energy-related commodities, namely, genera- tion output (usually measured in megawatt-hours, MWh) but also power-related commodities (usually measured in megawatt-hours, MW) such as ancillary services. Energy can be traded in forward mar- kets (in the form of long-term contracts), and spot markets. Ancillary services maintain the proper flow and direction of electricity, address imbalances between supply and demand, and help the system recover after a power system event.
The integration of RE into a power system increases variability and uncertainty and requires a higher level of flexibility, that is the ability on the part of the system to respond rapidly to changes in demand and supply. Numerous options for increasing flexibility are available. Flexibility reflects not just the physical systems, but also the institu- tional framework. The economic cost of different options for achieving flexibility varies, but institutional change may be one of the least ex- pensive. The experience from leading RE countries such as Germany, the United States and Spain where grids are operating with 20–30% RE output (RAP, 2014) demonstrates that electricity market mechanisms can enhance power system flexibility.
2.1. Relevance of electricity spot markets to RE integration
REs are weather-dependent. Wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales (hourly, daily, or seasonally), and, in many places, more wind energy is generated at nighttime. Solar power can only generate energy during daytime. As a result, the available supply of RE at any given time is inflexible. In the absence of flexibility in power supply or in demand-side response, the instantaneous balance of electricity generation and consumption can only be maintained at the expense of grid security (frequency disorder) or economic efficiency (curtailment of wind and solar power).
Since RE generation can be forecast one day ahead with reasonable accuracy, RE is usually traded in electricity spot markets, including day- ahead, intra-day and/or real-time (also called balancing) markets. In electricity markets, the power generation schedule is determined by the outcome of energy trading resulting from the interaction of the demand curve (the purchase amount and price offered by electricity buyers) with the supply curve (the sales amount and price offered by electricity sellers). Although it has significant fixed capital costs, RE has near-zero or zero variable production costs because of the free source of fuel. Where production-based subsidies exist, this variable cost can be ne- gative. Hence, utilizing its marginal cost advantage in an electricity market, RE can make very competitive offers and achieve priority dis- patch. Meanwhile, affected by the low electricity prices resulting from RE's competitive bids, other less competitive conventional power sources have to reduce their output as much as possible. In contrast, when RE output is low, the clearing price in electricity market rises, and all types of flexible power can be stimulated to generate as much as possible.
The experience of Germany illustrates this well. On 30th April 2017, Germany set a new record in its RE deployment. On that day, 85% of electricity consumption was provided by RE, including wind power, solar power, biomass power and hydropower. This achievement was largely attributable to several factors including the electricity spot market, strong power regulations, a strong cross-border transmission network and advanced dispatching operation technology. During the period 25–30th April 2017, the highest clearing price in the day-ahead market was 0.053 euro/kWh. This appeared at 08.00 h. on 26th April when wind and solar power output was very low. The lowest clearing price was −0.075 euro/kWh at 14.00 h on 30th April (Martinot, 2015; Huang and Wang, 2017). This price mechanism in the spot market had the effect of motivating other sources, such as coal, to undertake ret- rofitting to enhance flexibility, to produce less when electricity prices are low and produce more when electricity prices are high.
Flexibility is also needed on the demand-side. In a real-time market, time-of-use (TOU) tariffs can guide the behavior of end-users so as to balance electricity demand and supply. In Germany and the United States, the establishment of a real-time electricity market has facilitated the promotion of price-based demand-side responses (RAP, 2014). For example, since the electricity price at nighttime tends to be lower than that at daytime because of the higher wind power output, and lower electricity load, power end-users have been guided to consume more power at night, thus promoting wind power consumption. In addition, real-time markets have promoted the development of energy storage technology. Theoretically, energy storage facilities can undertake ar- bitrage by making use of the spread of prices at different times. This will help align the variable supply curve resulting from RE integration with the demand curve.
2.2. Relevance of electricity ancillary services to RE integration
Ancillary services refer to a broad range of functions that are re- quired by power system operators and are provided by network users (generators, customers) or system assets. These services enable system operators to maintain the integrity and stability of the transmission or distribution system as well as the power quality. Ancillary services in- clude remote automatic generation control (AGC), frequency control, voltage control, spinning reserve, standing reserve and black start capability.
A high level of RE integration into the power system increases the requirements for various ancillary services to ensure back-up to RE as the electricity produced by these generators usually enjoys guaranteed transmission and distribution, while at the same time, due to the in- herent intermittent nature of variable REs, their reliability is low and the delivery of electricity is unpredictable. The costs of the ancillary services should be properly valued to incentivize ancillary service providers, particularly when providing the service conflicts with pro- ducing electricity to be sold on the market. The combination of real- time balancing markets and ancillary service markets help to value these services rightly, and are thus conducive to the accommodation of variable REs. Denmark has facilitated RE integration by making use of frequency regulation and AGC to ensure the stability of the power system frequency (RAP, 2014). In the real-time balancing market, the system operator dispatches the units that make the lowest offer to balance the power system, thus achieving system balance in an eco- nomically efficient way.
2.3. Relevance of inter-jurisdictional power market to RE integration
Broad balancing areas and geographic diversity help address the variability of RE and reduce the need for flexible reserves. A power market with large balancing areas enables the transmission of power from regions with an ample availability of RE to other regions with high electricity demand. It facilitates RE integration with conventional power and opens the possibility for different REs to complement each other at different times (e.g. solar power during the day, wind power overnight) and/or in different regions. Higher interconnection and transmission capacity also enables the optimal use of surplus genera- tion, alleviates the problem of daily and seasonal demand peaks, re- duces the requirements for regulation reserves, enhances congestion management, and reduces the need for new (and back-up) generation capacity.
In Denmark, more than 41 percent of the energy for electricity supply is generated from RE, of which 28 percent is generated from wind power. The existence of a market-based power exchange with neighboring countries is the most important tool for dealing with high shares of wind power in Denmark. With 6.4 GW of net transfer capacity to Norway, Sweden and Germany (Danish peak demand: 6GW), Denmark is able to sell electricity during times of high wind energy production, and to import electricity in times of low wind energy pro- duction (Ea, 2015).
3. Institutional barriers to RE integration in China
Since 1985, China has undergone several rounds of electricity market reforms. The 1985 reforms encouraged local government and companies to invest in new generation capacity, which led to a surge of investment at the local level, diversifying away from central govern- ment control of generation capacity. While the reforms in the late 1990s separated government functions from enterprise management, the 2002 reforms witnessed China's power sector move from a single, vertically integrated utility to two grid companies, namely, the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) covering most of the country, and the China Southern Grid Corporation (CSGC) covering 5 southern pro- vinces, five large generating companies and a large number of other companies. In addition, five regional grid companies were created as subsidiaries of the SGCC.
As previously noted, the need to integrate a growing share of vari- able RE requires flexibility in other generation resources, which in turn requires more flexible and efficient planning, scheduling, and dispatch processes. China's current electricity regime, however, is not consistent with the needs of a power system that has a high share of variable generation. The main constraints to the integration of higher share of RE in China lie in the ‘equal shares’ generation dispatch approach, the government regulated electricity prices, the limited inter-provincial electricity trade, and the lack of formal compensation mechanisms for electricity ancillary services.
3.1. ‘Equal shares’ generation dispatch approach
In economies where electricity markets exist, dispatch is largely optimized based on a ‘merit order approach’, which means that avail- able electrical generation is ranked on the basis of ascending order of price together with amount of energy that will be generated. The merit order enables the lowest net cost electricity to be dispatched first thus minimizing overall electricity system costs to consumers. In the best cases, this merit order approach reflects not just fuel and operating costs, but also includes the emissions costs associated with each gen- erating unit.
Generation dispatch in China continues to be guided by instructions from economic planning agencies within provincial governments, a practice that dates to the days of the planned economy. At the end of each year, the provincial governments allocate the total electricity generation hours to each generating plant based on the electricity de- mand forecast for the next year. Units within the same category are allocated the same annual generation hours to guarantee an equitable chance for all investors, and are paid a benchmark wholesale tariff set by the provincial government based on the embedded cost of a new unit. This tariff is based on the unit fixed costs divided by the operating hours, plus the unit variable costs. Dispatching of plants is carried out based on a combination of the assigned operating hours and forecast load curve (IEA, 2006). This system for dispatch creates an obvious conflict with the priority dispatch of RE required by China's Renewable Energy Law of 2009. It also underplays the marginal cost and en- vironmental advantages of RE. These deficiencies in the dispatch system are closely related to the way in which wholesale tariffs are set (IEA, 2006), as will be discussed in the following section.
3.2. Regulated electricity pricing mechanism
Electricity tariffs for wholesale and retail continue to remain con- trolled by the central government after China separated electricity generation from transmission and distribution (R&D) in 2002. The government sets benchmark wholesale tariffs for generating plants that depend on a combination of location, technology and feedstock, and broadly reflect local market conditions. It is an energy-only tariff, with no capacity component. This benchmark provides the basis for nego- tiations between individual power plants and the provincial Development and Reform Commissions. The final agreed tariff is in- tended to allow the plant to make a reasonable economic return on its investment, given that age of the plant and the number of operating hours allocated under the ‘equal shares’ approach described above. This scheme for setting wholesale tariffs encourages thermal plants to maximize their output, but does not incentivize flexibility. The gov- ernment also sets retail tariffs. Once again, these tariffs vary between provinces and cities, and between different categories of end-users. The T&D tariffs equate to the difference between the wholesale and retail tariffs (Depuy, 2015; RAP, 2008). 
3.3. Lack of proper mechanisms for procuring ancillary services
China's grid-connected power plants have long provided ancillary services, but without any ancillary service markets. Since the 2002 reforms, ancillary services in China have been categorized into ‘basic’ ancillary services (including primary frequency, basic peak regulation and basic reactive power regulation), and ‘paid’ ancillary services (in- cluding AGC, spinning and standing reserve, paid peak regulation, paid reactive power regulating and black start). Whilst basic ancillary ser- vices are mandatory and provided free of charge, other ancillary ser- vices receive compensation payments. Electricity generation units are currently obliged to provide these basic ancillary services arranged by the dispatch agencies based on the principle of ‘dispatch whenever there is a need’, depending on the features of generation units and si- tuation of grid operations. In general, there is no standard mechanism for procuring the compensated ancillary services (Pollitt et al., 2017), and the payments to grid-connected power plants which provide an- cillary services are usually less than 0.30% of generation revenue (on- grid tariff multiplied by generation output). This can barely cover the costs of ancillary services (Lu, 2016). Under such an administrative mechanism, the additional cost of ancillary services incurred by the increasing penetration of RE cannot be effectively reflected in the payment to the generating unit. This has undermined the incentive for power plants to provide ancillary services, including the ancillary ser- vices resulted from RE integration.
3.4. Limited inter-provincial and inter-regional electricity trading
Despite the growing degree of interconnection across China's power system, the amount of inter-provincial trading of electricity remains low. In 2014, the nationwide inter-provincial and inter-regional elec- tricity traded was 884.2 TWh, most of which were in administrative rather than market-based form. In addition, some local governments intervened in inter-provincial electricity trading. For example, in 2014 Jiangxi Energy Administration Bureau required that the annual elec- tricity imported by the province should not exceed 10 TWh, and elec- tricity imported temporarily (within 3 days) and in short term (3–10 days) should not exceed 1 TWh (NEA, 2016b).
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, provincial governments re- main directly involved in investment and planning decisions, due to the unique role of the power sector in providing jobs and tax revenues. They control or guide the siting of plants, financing through local banks, the allocation of generating hours, and both wholesale and retail tariffs. Provincial governments also invest in generating plants on their own account. Consequently, local governments continue to fight to maximize their control of the power sector within their jurisdictions, often in direct conflict with central government policies (Pollitt et al., 2017).
Secondly, the initial aim of the 2002 reforms to promote larger balancing areas by the creation within the SGCC of five regional grid companies was undermined when the assets of these companies were allocated to provincial subsidiaries. This further enhanced the influence of provincial governments over the power system. With the exception of the North China grid company, all the regional grid companies lost their autonomy and the opportunity for systematic regional dispatch was missed (Dupuy, 2016).
4. The new reforms and new RE integration policy in China
4.1. Main elements of new reforms
In March 2015, the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party promulgated Several Opinions on Deepening Power Sector Reform (Zhongfa[2015] Document #9), signifying the launch of the new reforms in China. Following the issuance of Document #9, six critical accompanying documents were released, detailing the implementation paths and measures for the reforms to the electricity market, transaction system, power generation and utilization, elec- tricity T&D tariffs and electricity demand side management. The overall objective of the new reforms is to establish a market-based power sector (CCCP and the State Council, 2015).
The new reforms are characterized by ‘regulating the middle and deregulating the two ends’ (Zhao, 2016), which means regulating the T&D segments and introducing competition into the generation and retail segments of the electricity sector. The grid companies are to be stripped of their monopolies in the retail segment, allowing other firms, including many privately-owned firms, to engage in electricity re- tailing.
According to the reform documents, the path towards electricity market will be designed as follows:
– The orderly retreat of electricity generation and consumption planning, and the deregulation of electricity tariffs in competitive segments (generation and consumption segments);
– The continuous expansion of the scope of market players’ partici- pation in direct trading of electricity and the scale of direct trading of electricity;
– The gradual establishment of market-oriented mechanisms for the inter-provincial trading of power;
– The identification of qualified pilot areas to build more complete electricity markets, including long- and mid-term markets as well as spot markets, and to later expand the scope of pilot areas (Zhao, 2016).
In contrast to the 2002 reforms, the new reforms place much em- phasis on environmental and emissions concerns. Key priorities relating to RE include:
– To prioritize RE in generation planning and dispatch;
– To increase the proportion of RE in inter-provincial and inter-regional power trading;
– To establish ancillary services markets and cost-sharing mechanisms;
– To regulate captive power plants to improve the flexibility of the power system and promote the engagement of such generators in wider electricity ancillary services;
– To allow distributed renewable generators to engage in retail business, among others (Depuy, 2016)."
39,To what extent will China's ongoing electricity market reforms assist the integration of renewable energy?,"Poor renewable energy (RE) integration is posing a huge challenge to China's electricity sector. This paper examines the extent to which China's power sector reforms will assist RE integration, and issues to effective implementation. It demonstrates that a well-established electricity market could provide practical solutions to RE integration challenge. China's existing power sector regime heavily regulated by administrative planning constrains RE integration. The on-going electricity reforms (new reforms) in the country such as the transmission and distribution (T&D) tariff reform, the direct trading of electricity, among others, along with new RE policies such as full purchase of guaranteed RE generation and green certificate system, should assist RE integration in the country. However, there are a number of implementation challenges such as the intervention from local governments in direct electricity trades and the lack of a quota system for RE, among others. If these challenges are not properly addressed, the potential positive impacts of the new reforms on RE integration will be undermined. It is recommended that the central government strengthen top-level design and supervision, design and build up electricity spot markets, push forward the regional electricity markets, and facilitate the establishment of a renewable quota system.","4.2. Implications of the new reforms for China's RE integration
Since the launch of the new reforms, four types of reforms have been piloted across China, including T&D tariff reform throughout the country, retail side reform in nine provinces and municipalities, and reforms in new distribution business in 105 pilot areas. In addition, 32 electricity trading organizations have been established. Of these, the Beijing Electricity Trading Center (BETC) and the Guangzhou Electricity Trading Center (GETC) are at national level, whilst others are either at regional or provincial levels (Wang, 2017; NDRC, 2015; NEA, 2015; Du and Jiang, 2015). The implications for RE integration of, in succession, the deregulation of pricing and electricity generation, the compensation mechanisms for ancillary services, and efforts to build regional markets are discussed in the following subsections.
4.2.1. Deregulation of pricing and electricity generation
The deregulation of pricing and electricity generation has three components: T&D tariff reform, direct trading of electricity and the retreat of planning. T&D tariff reform changes the ways in which the grid companies earn revenue and profit. In the T&D segment, tariffs should be set under the principle of ‘allowable cost plus reasonable profit’ (Dong, 2017). This revenue-cap regulatory regime breaks the link of T&D tariff with wholesale and retail tariffs. This reform provides the foundation for deregulating generation planning, introducing full competition into generation, deregulating the retail market, developing inter-regional and -provincial trading, direct trading of electricity be- tween generators and end-users, and long-term and mid-term trading as well as spot trading. The positive side of this reform for RE integration is that due to its low marginal cost, RE will be in an advantageous position in various competitive markets. This will include bidding for generation, direct trading of electricity between generators and end- users, and inter-regional and -provincial electricity trading.
Direct trading of electricity allows electricity users to bypass the grid company and negotiate prices directly with generators. As such, electricity users and generators have full autonomy in power purchase and power sale respectively, and power pricing is determined by market rather than government. Direct trading of electricity was introduced as one of the more radical components of the 2002 reforms. However, as some provincial governments used this system to give preferential power tariffs to energy intensive industries, the NDRC called an abrupt halt to the short-lived reform experiment in March 2009. It was not until 2013 that provincial-level experiments were restarted (NDRC and NEA, 2015).
The new reforms emphasize the expansion of existing provincial- level pilot programs. Further, RE generation exceeding guaranteed generation hours (see Section 4.3.1.) is encouraged to participate in direct trading of electricity. Since 2015, direct trading of electricity has occurred in northwest and northeast China between RE generators and large power users. In addition, direct trading of power generation rights took place between RE generators in northwest China and thermal power generators in, for example, Shanghai, Henan, and Chongqing. This shows government intention to enhance RE integration through a market-based approach.
The orderly retreat of planning from electricity generation is to be performed in two ways. On the one hand, a prioritized dispatch system for generation system will ensure the integration of clean energy and power sources providing peak regulation services. The on-grid tariff for these priority power sources can either be set by government or be formed in the market. On the other hand, the direct trading of elec- tricity and electricity market will supplant the role of planning. Local governments are required to reduce the generation quotas for existing coal-fired power plants year by year. In general, the generation quota for 2017 should be no more than 80% of the total generation hours in the previous year (NDRC and NEA, 2017). No generation quota should be granted to coal-fired power units approved after the issuance of Document #9. Once commissioned, these new units will be included in market transactions and their wholesale tariffs will be formed in the marketplace. If fully implemented, these measures will change the current situation in which conventional power sources continue to enjoy priority of dispatch, and will help the integration of RE.
4.2.2. Improvement of compensation mechanism for ancillary services
Document #9 emphasizes the importance of ancillary services, and the need to improve the compensation mechanisms for ancillary ser- vices. Accordingly, a compensation mechanism for ancillary services based on the idea of ‘Shared Responsibility and Shared Gains’ is to be established. Electricity end-users and retailers are encouraged to par- ticipate in ancillary services by contracting with either generators or grid companies. Subsequent to Document #9, on 7th June 2016 the National Energy Administration (NEA) released the Notification of Promoting Energy Storage Participation in Ancillary Services in the ‘Three Norths’ Region (the Notification), opening up power markets in North China to energy storage, principally pump storage hydropower (NCERB, 2016). The Notification marks for the first recognition that energy storage can participate in providing ancillary services.
Further, in October 2016 the NEA announced the creation of a pilot electricity ancillary services market in Northeast China as the first na- tional level special reform pilot market (Suo, 2017). On 1st January 2017, the pilot market was formally initiated. To date, five types of ancillary services have been traded in the market, namely deep peak regulation, emergency start and stop of thermal power, inter-provincial peak regulation, pumped storage hydro-power excess supply, and black start. More ancillary services are expected to be traded. The new market has motivated thermal power plants in the competition for peak reg- ulation. About 89% of thermal power plants have requested to provide more deep-peak regulation (Han, 2016). These measures demonstrate the government efforts to develop ancillary services to help integrate RE and the potential for a successful outcome.
4.2.3. Efforts to build inter-regional and -provincial electricity market Document #9 and its supporting documents require the further improvement of inter-regional and inter-provincial electricity trading mechanisms and state that regional and provincial power exchanges should be built. On 1st March 2016, two national level exchange cen- ters (BETC and GETC) were established. These are in charge of the construction and operation of inter-regional and -provincial electricity markets, and the implementation of state planned electricity trading agreements between local governments within the business jurisdiction
of the SGCC and the SGC respectively.
On 29th July 2016, NEA approved the Provisional Rules for Direct
Trading of Electricity between Power Users and Generators in the Jing-Jin- Tang Grid submitted by North China Energy Regulation Bureau of NEA, attempting to build the Jing (Beijing)-Jin (Tianjin)-Ji (Hebei Province) electricity market (NEA, 2016a; Zhang and Xue, 2017), the first re- gional electricity market in the country since the launch of Document #9. Unfortunately, the Construction Scheme of Jing-Jin-Ji Electricity Market was not issued as expected in October 2016 and, as of August 2017, the regional electricity trading center has not been established (NDRC, 2016).
4.3. New RE integration policies pertinent to the new reforms
In addition to the general market measures just described, the new reform strategy also introduced two measures explicitly to promote RE:the requirement for the full purchase of guaranteed RE generation and the creation of a green electricity certificate system.
4.3.1. Requirement of full purchase of guaranteed RE generation
The Renewable Energy Law, enacted in 2006 and amended in 2009, requires full purchase of all RE generation. Document 9 and several supporting policies have reaffirmed this principle. However, as pre- viously noted, in the context of China's current electricity regime, it is the conventional fossil fuel-powered units that enjoy real priority dis- patch, and this has crowded out RE generation, resulting in RE cur- tailment.
To address this issue, on 28th March 2016, the government pro- mulgated the Management Measures for the Full Purchase of Guaranteed RE Generation (the Measures) (Fagai Nengyuan [2016]625]) (NDRC, 2016). This document introduces significant new elements. The first element is a mandated ‘guarantee’ that grid companies purchase output from renewable generators in regions of the country that have been experiencing curtailment, at least up to an allocated number of hours (Qin, 2016). The guaranteed number of hours is based on assured in- ternal rate of return (IRR) for RE generators (Dupuy and Wang, 2016). The second element is a call to directly compensate RE generators for curtailment. In the case where curtailment results from non-renewable generators ‘infringing on absorption space and transmission capacity’, then the non-renewable generators are responsible for paying com- pensation. Alternatively, if the curtailment is due to the grid company's misconduct, then the grid company must take responsibility for com- pensation. The third element is that the NDRC and NEA will be re- sponsible for planning the allocation of the guaranteed number of hours for each type of renewable generation (Qin, 2016; NDRC et al., 2017).
In addition, the document states that beyond the allocated hours which are ‘guaranteed purchase’, renewable generators are allowed to negotiate contracts with end-users (‘market traded generation’), and these contracts will be given priority dispatch rights. RE generators are encouraged to participate in mid- to long-term trading and spot market competition. The traded generation will receive the market (negotiated) price, plus the national subsidy (the difference between local feed-in tariffs for RE and the local benchmark tariffs for desulfurized coal-fired power) (Qin, 2016; NDRC et al., 2017). The decision to give these central government agencies responsibility for this planning - formerly held at the provincial government level - may help strengthen the guarantee. Further, the Measures explicitly states that the relevant de- partments of local governments should fully reserve for wind and solar power the guaranteed generation hours required by the central gov- ernment when designing and implementing power generation and electricity trading schemes. Electricity grid companies are to enter into contracts with wind and solar power generators for annual priority generation purchase of guaranteed renewable energy.
4.3.2. Creation of green certificate system
On 6th February 2017, the Notification on the Experimental System of
Verification, Issuance, Voluntary Purchase and Transaction of Green Electricity Certificate of Renewable Energy (the Notification) was issued jointly by NDRC, the Ministry of Finance and the NEA. The green cer- tificate is an electronic certificate bearing a unique identification code issued by the government to power generators for non-hydropower, grid-connected RE. Each certificate is equivalent to 1 MWh of electricity settled. Based on a national database of RE projects, the program is currently being run as a trial. Certificates can be issued to onshore, grid- connected wind and solar PV power generators. Other renewable sources including distributed solar PV power are excluded. To apply for the green certificate, wind and solar PV power generators need to submit certain documents to the Information Management Center (the Center) under the NEA. The Center then verifies the documents and issues the green electricity certificate on monthly basis (Qin, 2016; NDRC et al., 2017).
The pilot program of voluntary purchase of green electricity certi- ficates started on 1st July 2017, and the price of certificate is de- termined by negotiation between the buyer and the seller or bid. The price should not be lower than the RE subsidy level received for the same quantity of power output. Green electricity certificates are not transferable, and purchasers are not eligible for other RE government subsidies. Depending upon the performance of the pilot program and the assessments of RE quotas, a compulsory scheme is scheduled to be launched in early 2018 (NDRC et al., 2017).
The creation of the green certificate system allows wind and solar PV power generators to obtain additional revenue in more timely fashion than is currently possible via government subsidy payments that have been experiencing substantial delays. Whether or not this will assist RE integration is open to question (see below, Section 5.2.2).
5. Challenges to new reforms and new RE integration policy
5.1. Challenges to new reforms
5.1.1. Challenges to direct trading of electricity
The direct trading of electricity is one of the main elements of the new reforms. In practice, however, some provinces have forced RE generators to lower their prices, in the name of direct trading. For in- stance, direct trading of electricity between RE generators and large end-users in Gansu province were concluded largely at a zero tariff. Renewable energy enterprises and observation institutions have begun to question whether, under the current market trading mechanism, the renewable energy enterprises have become a tool to reduce retail tariff for local energy intensive enterprises (He, 2017). The second concern is that local governments are intervening in the direct trading of elec- tricity by, for instance, specifying end-users that generators should sell to. This is clearly deviating from a market mechanism. The third concern is that many generators are establishing electricity retail companies that may build market power and undermine competition.
5.1.2. Challenges to regional electricity trading
As of August 2017, most direct electricity trades have been intra- provincial, and regional electricity markets have yet to be established. There are three underlying reasons for this. In the first place, intra- provincial electricity trading generates more taxes for provincial gov- ernments than inter-provincial electricity trading. This is because taxes imposed on local power generators and local power users go to local (provincial) governments, whilst taxes on grid companies go to the central government. The second reason is that, in recent years, potential electricity supply has exceeded national electricity demand. As a result, some provinces are not willing to import electricity from other pro- vinces, as this will reduce the revenue of local coal-fired power plants.
The third reason is related to the high cost of transmission and line losses for inter-provincial electricity flows. For instance, the transmis- sion cost, including intra- and inter-transmission and line losses, for electricity flow between Yunnan (electricity exporting province) and Guangdong (electricity importing province) is as high as 0.2 CNY/kWh. This results in the landing price of hydropower from Yunnan to Guangdong being the same as the local on-grid tariff for thermal power in Guangdong (Ding and Yao, 2017). Since wind and solar power generation costs are higher than the cost of hydropower, it is likely that the competitiveness of these two power sources will be greatly under- mined in regional electricity trading
5.2. Challenges to new RE integration policies
5.2.1. Challenges to the full purchase of guaranteed RE generation According to the Circular on the Monitoring and Evaluation of National Renewable Energy Development in 2016 issued by the NEA on 10th April 2017, the implementation of the full purchase of guaranteed RE gen- eration was far from being satisfactory (NEA, 2017b). Only three out of nine provinces had fulfilled the guaranteed generation hours for wind power and two out of eleven provinces had fulfilled the guaranteed generation hours for solar power set by the government for 2016. In some provinces, the gaps between the guaranteed annual generation hours and the fulfilled generation hours for wind and solar power ex-
ceeded 480 h and 350 h respectively (NEA, 2017b).
Although the Measures clearly defined the obligations of govern-
ment and grid companies with regard to the full purchase of guaranteed purchase of RE generation, it remains to be seen whether local gov- ernments and grid companies will effectively perform their obligations. Further, whether local agencies of the NEA are capable of overseeing and evaluating the performances of local governments and grid com- panies is questionable. Currently, the local regulatory agencies of the NEA are poorly resourced. The total staff is about 500 people, equiva- lent to an average of only 16–17 individuals per province. In some pilot areas, there are less than 10 members of staff (Jiang, 2016).
5.2.2. Challenges to green certificate system
The first challenge is that if the electricity market is not properly
developed in the process of reform, the effective implementation of the green certificate system would be difficult since it is a market-based system. The other challenge is that the Notification states that all levels of government agencies, enterprises, social institutions and individuals can voluntarily purchase green electricity certificates, but does not clarify who will become the assessment subject when the mandatory assessment system is introduced in 2018. The NDRC and other relevant departments had considered coal-fired power companies to be subjects for compulsory assessment. However, this proposal has encountered strong opposition from these companies which argued that they had suffered huge losses resulted from the soaring coal price in the first half of 2016. This cost could not be passed on to power end-users due to the existing regulated wholesale and retail pricing mechanism as previously noted. If they were subjected to compulsory assessment, their business costs would likely increase even more (Chen and Xue, 2017). Some argued that electricity retail companies should be subject to compulsory assessment, a common practice in some leading renewable energy countries. But others held that currently China's electricity retail com- panies are locally established, rarely participating inter-provincial electricity trading. In the case where local renewable energy sources are scarce, it would be difficult for these companies to procure renewable energy. Thus, the issue of which enterprises should be subject to as- sessment remains unresolved as of August 2017.
6. Policy implications
6.1. Strengthen top-level design and supervision
Unlike the 2002 reforms that were driven in a top-down manner, new reforms require provincial governments to take the lead in im- plementing the reforms. Problems have arisen with this new approach. The ultimate objective of the reforms from the perspective of provincial governments is to sharply reduce electricity retail tariffs in order to enhance the local economy. This evidently deviates from the central government's objective, which is to optimize resource deployment and enhance RE development. To address this conflict, effective top-level design is required. Central government should clarify that electricity reform must be able to promote energy resource flow and coordination between regions. In this respect, it is necessary to enforce constraints on the reforms led by local governments. Local governments should not be permitted to develop their own reform strategies, as this will lead to a fragmented national market. Instead, they should be required to im- plement the reform in alignment with the reform principles set by the central government.
Although Document #9 does emphasize strengthening central government regulation, to date this component of the reform remains weak. In the first place, although there are specific supporting docu- ments on all other main reform elements, there is no specific document on government supervision. Further, in practice, little priority has been attached to the government regulation of market actors. It is therefore recommended that policymakers attach greater importance to evalu- ating possible regulation approaches in the context of the new reforms. Secondly, relevant laws and rule systems should be improved. For in- stance, the Regulation on Electricity Supervision issued in 2005 should be revised to adapt to the new reform context. Finally, it is necessary to increase the manpower in the relevant agencies and strengthen reg- ulatory capacity.
6.2. Build up electricity spot markets
Electricity spot markets can provide transparent and constantly updated information and are the basis for determining long-term con- tract prices as well as ancillary services markets. The government should take careful and well-considered steps to develop electricity spot markets. There are several reasons for this. In the first place, the op- eration of an electricity spot market is complex and the construction of an electricity spot market is costly. Once a market model is built up, changing it would bring about high economic costs. Therefore, when designing and constructing a spot market, it is necessary to take full consideration of China's reality and to design the market in a systematic way. Secondly, spot markets should span large regions in order to better enable the transmission of RE from western to eastern China. Thirdly, these markets should be subject to strict trading rules. These trading rules must guarantee the stability of the power grid and prevent si- tuations in which actors manipulate the markets, undermining power end-users’ interests and market fairness.
6.3. Push forward regional electricity markets
Greater regional dispatch would reduce production costs, improve reliability, and reduce total emissions through reducing the variability of both load and generation, and by accessing to a larger portfolio of generation resources from meeting electricity demand and for pro- viding ancillary services. However, in more than 20 provinces, there exists the phenomenon that one single generation company takes more than 20% of the total installed capacity in the province. In some pro- vinces, the share amounts to as high as 50% (Wang, 2017). This allows the generating companies to acquire market power on the generation side, implying that they could manipulate the electricity market, un- dermining market fairness. Strategies to advance the growth of regional electricity markets enables mitigation of this problem.
Given that the construction of a regional electricity market is be- yond the authority of local governments, the NDRC and NEA should play a central role in improving the market mechanisms needed for supporting the construction of regional electricity markets. Tasks in- clude establishing a mechanism for setting regional T&D tariffs in a more rational way, and removing the barriers to inter-regional and inter-provincial trade. Meanwhile, policymakers should establish in- centive mechanisms to encourage electricity grid companies to play a greater role in the construction of regional markets. This would include giving the cost of RE integration full consideration in the evaluation of T&D cost.
Another important requirement is to incentivize the eastern pro- vinces to purchase more RE generation from western provinces. Given that eastern provinces have carbon emission obligations, if their pur- chase of green certificate is counted into their fulfillment of carbon emission quota, these eastern provinces would certainly be more willing to purchase green energy. This would enhance not only inter- regional and inter-provincial markets for RE but also the demand for green certificates.
6.4. Facilitate the establishment of renewable energy quota system
The renewable energy quota system (RQS), similar to the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in the US and renewable obligation (RO) in the UK, is a mechanism designed to promote RE deployment. It requires relevant electricity market players to generate or purchase a certain proportion of renewable energy. To fulfill their renewable obligations, while generators would generate RE, obtain and sell their green certi- ficates, electricity consumers, grid companies, and electricity retailers would purchase these green certificates. This system is both compulsory and market-based in that, on the one hand, if companies fail to fulfill their obligations, they are punished and, on the other hand, green certificates are tradable in the market.
Currently, China lacks both the system for imposing this obligation as well as electricity market conditions to implement RQS. The existing Renewable Energy Law fails to provide specific provisions with regard to such obligations, rewards and punishments, though it noted the proportion of renewable energy. Meanwhile, China's electricity market is still in the process of being developed. Therefore, it is recommended that the central government revise the Law to provide legal safeguards for the establishment of an RQS, as well as improve green certificate market trading mechanisms by incorporating green certificate trading market with carbon trading market. Currently, both markets are at their start-up stage, and there is no clear distinction between these two markets. For example, the developer of a particular renewable energy project may apply for and sell green certificates in the green certificate trading market and Chinese Certified Emission Reductions (CCER) in carbon trading market at the same time.
7. Conclusion
Along with the dramatic growth of RE in China over the past decade, RE curtailment has posed increasing challenge to China's low carbon transition. The nature of the existing power sector regime, still heavily regulated by administrative practices and planning, is the un- derlying institutional reason for this challenge. From a theoretical perspective, a well-established electricity market could provide prac- tical solutions to this challenge. China's new reforms, which have the promotion of RE deployment as one of their main objectives, are di- rected at using market mechanisms to promote RE integration. Between 2015 and 2017, reforms relevant to RE integration have advanced ra- pidly. These include the T&D tariff reform, the direct trading of elec- tricity, the opening up of electricity generation planning, the estab- lishment of new ancillary services purchase mechanisms, the full purchase of guaranteed RE generation and the green certificate system.
Nevertheless, there exist challenges both to the new reforms and to the new RE policies pertinent to the new reforms. The first challenge relates to direct trading of electricity resulting from the low tariffs imposed by local governments on trades between RE generators and large end-users, the local governments’ practice of designating buyers, and the possible market power of the retail companies owned by large generators. The second challenge arises from a combination of local tax considerations, local economic priorities, and the high cost of trans- mission and line losses incurred by inter-provincial electricity flows. The third challenge relates to the difficulty of implementing the full purchase of guarantees for RE generation as the country lacks a quota system for RE, and the NEA lacks the capacity for effective oversight of local governments and grid companies. The final challenge derives from the possible difficulty in implementing the green certificate system in the absence of fully competitive electricity markets, and the lack of agreement concerning assessment subjects when the mandatory as- sessment system is introduced in 2018.
If these challenges are not properly addressed, the potential positive impacts of the new reforms on RE integration will be undermined. It is therefore recommended that the central government strengthen top- level design and supervision, design and build up electricity spot mar- kets, push forward the regional electricity markets, and facilitate the establishment of a renewable quota system."
40,Trading risk control model of electricity retailers in multi-level power market of China,"The decision-making and risk assessment of electricity purchase and sales is the key to adapt to the electricity market for independent electricity retailers in China. This research carried out the purchase and sales risks of electricity for electricity retailers and constructed the multi-level market purchase and sales combination optimization model. Based on the portfolio optimization theory, the conditional value at risk theory (CVaR) was proposed. Based on the evaluation index about the conditional risk profit and CVaR, electricity retailers purchase and sales combined optimization model has been constructed to explore the impact of purchase and sales risks by different factors in multi-level electricity market. The example analysis was carried out by the fixed spread mode and the linkage spread mode. The results showed that the mathematical mean and variance of market spread had great influence on the electricity purchase and sales combination. Especially in the mature electricity market, the mathematical mean of spread and risk in medium- and long-term market was smaller than that in spot market, and the best point of the electricity purchase and sales combination was shown on the smallest value of CVaR, while the electricity purchase and sales combination was optimal under limited conditions.","1 | INTRODUCTION
Currently, electricity reform is in the early stage of devel- opment in China. The main profit model of the electricity retailer is to sign the power sales contract with the retail mar- ket users and then use this as the basis for the load demand of the wholesale market to purchase electricity from the an- nual market and the monthly market, respectively. With the development and improvement of the spot market, the elec- tricity retailers also need to participate in the spot market to purchase electricity. Moreover, the obvious trading links and the differences of the power market bring different degrees of investment risk for electricity retailers at various levels.1 Minimizing the risk under the revenue target effectively and configuring the electricity investment portfolio is the focus of the electricity retailers.2,3
Current researches are mainly on electricity retailers, while there are not many studies on the sales and the sales of electricity retailers from the perspective of risk. The current research can be divided into the following points:
1. Research on electricity purchase and sales of electricity retailers. Kirschen4 studied the user's participation in the power retail market from the demand side and proposed relevant technical means and market tools, which laid the foundation for the follow‐up retail market. Anderson and Philpott5 studied the bidding behaviors in the elec- tricity market and constructed a bid optimization model. Based on Anderson's research, Fleten and Pettersen6 proposed a cost‐optimized bidding optimization model based on the Nordic electricity market and proposed a bidding strategy for price‐receiving power companies. However, the shortcoming of these studies is that they only studied the trading technology level and did not provide risk‐related research.
2. Research on trading risk of electricity sales retailers. In general, the degree of possible loss is more concerned and worthy of study than other indicators.7 Therefore, it is more suitable to describe the risk of trading. For the research on the risk of electricity retailers, Martello8 and others carried out risk assessment and decision analysis for the electricity retailers from the user demand side management analysis, based on risk uncertainty and price quota curve and utility theory, then built different simula- tion scenarios and considered fixed prices and real‐time electricity price contracts. Kettunen et al9 and others studied the impact of price and demand differences on the risk appetite of electricity retailers, thus affecting the electricity purchase contract portfolio strategy. Nojavan et al10 and others proposed pricing decisions for fixed, time‐ sharing, real‐time electricity sales contracts, etc, from the perspective of various electricity generation sources on the electricity purchase side, considering wind, light, and hydrogen storage energy sources. Wei et al11 considered both distributed energy and adjustable load to construct a new scheduling optimization model.
Through the research on the purchase and sales of electricity sold by the electricity retailers in the wholesale market and the retail market,12,13 it can be found that there were differ- ent degrees of risk in multiple links. The electricity retailers needed to set the user subsidy spread and multi‐level market electricity purchase combination to estimate and control the risk of purchase and sales.14-16 However, most studies consid- ered only on the medium‐ or long‐term contracts of a single electricity source, or only proposed pricing decisions, thus had insufficient research on risk.
This paper will analyze the profit risk from both purchase and sales sides of electricity and use the portfolio optimiza- tion theory to optimize the purchase and sales combination in the multi‐level electricity market, which will help the electricity retailers to determine the electricity distribution plan, to improve the average return as large as possible, and to decrease risks as large as possible; that is, a multi‐objec- tive optimization model will be proposed in multi‐level elec- tricity markets. The main research innovations include the following:
1. The paper constructs a multi‐level market purchase and sales combination optimization model based on the current new regulations for power market reform in China.
2. The paper constructs a CVaR‐optimized model for pur- chase and sales of electricity retailers and designs two different scenarios, proposes the application of CVaR op- timization theory and designs two different scenarios, and builds electricity combination optimization model.
3. Through the case analysis and sensitivity analysis, the ef- fectiveness of the optimization model is verified, which can help the electricity retailers to determine the optimal combination of market power under the minimum risk.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 sum- marizes the portfolio optimization model as the theoretical basis of the thesis research. Section 3 analyzes the strategy of purchasing and selling electricity for electricity retailers in multi‐level market. The transaction model is constructed in two dimensions, and the fixed price difference mecha- nism and the linkage price difference mechanism are de- signed. Section 4 is the analysis part of the example. The actual data and simulation data are collected to verify the model constructed in this paper. Section 5 presents the main conclusions.
2 | PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION THEORY
The mean‐variance model17 is a basic portfolio optimiza- tion model that uses the mean and variance distribution of the return distribution to represent the expected returns and risks and to determine the optimal portfolio for a given target. If the combined expected return is the abscissa and the risk index is the ordinate, it can constitute the income‐risk plane of the portfolio, as shown in Figure 1, which reflects the re- lationship between portfolio returns and risk. Among them, the set of points on the curve and within the curve is called a feasible set, which corresponds to a certain portfolio, called a feasible portfolio. For curve ACB, at all given risk levels 𝜎, on the top, the point is the upper half of the curve where the expected return is the largest. That is, the CA segment of the curve, which is called the effective frontier of the feasible portfolio set. It is a subset of the feasible set, and it can be said that the portfolio is the most optimal solution on the ef- fective frontier curve. An effective frontier is an intuitive tool that provides decision‐makers with a clear decision between risk and expected return. 18

   The conditional value at risk theory
from VaR and refers to the conditional mean of loss exceed- ing VaR, reflecting the average potential loss that may be ex- ceeded by the VaR value. The schematic diagram of CVaR is shown in Figure 2.
The formulas and description for VaR and CVaR can be found in reference.19 Comparing the two theories of VaR and CVaR, CVaR has obvious advantages, which can be summa- rized as two points: Firstly, conceptually, CVaR is not a single quantile, but the average of tail loss, only the tail loss greater than VaR can be estimated and calculated, so it is sufficient to measure the tail loss. Secondly, CVaR is a consistent risk measure and it can be applied to portfolio optimization for any distribution pattern. This is also the main point of its su- periority to VaR.
3 | PURCHASE AND SALES PORTFOLIO STRATEGY ANALYSIS OF ELECTRICITY RETAILER IN MULTI‐LEVEL MARKET
There are many types of electricity retailers now in China. This paper focuses on the strategy of purchasing and sell- ing electricity for independent electricity retailers. Since an independent electricity retailers does not have a physical in- dustry, its role in the electricity market is more similar to that of an intermediary, and the main benefit is also derived from the intermediate spread. In the current electricity market environment, it is mainly based on the catalog price, which is the spread model, and is a means used during the transition of the electricity market from catalog price to market‐based electricity price.20,21 For a electricity retailer, the purchase and sales of electricity combination strategy can be divided into two parts, a multi‐level market electricity purchase com- bination strategy and a multi‐type user sales combination strategy.
3.1 | Multi‐level market electricity purchase combination model
According to the current regulations in China's electric- ity market reform document and the time dimension, the power market can be divided into three major categories: medium‐ and long‐term market, spot market, and futures market. Among them, the medium‐ and long‐term mainly include the annual trading market and the monthly trading market. The spot market includes the day‐to‐day market, the intraday market, and the real‐time market. In the multi‐level electricity purchase market, the main considerations here are divided into annual market, monthly market, daily market, and real‐time market. The trading types of each market are different, and the income expectation and price fluctuation risk are also different.22 In general, medium‐ and long‐term market income expectations are the lowest, followed by the day‐to‐day market, and finally the real‐time market. For the price fluctuation risk, the medium‐ and long‐term market risk is the smallest, followed by the day‐to‐day market, and the real‐time market has the greatest risk. The electricity retailers can consider a variety of uncertain market factors, govern- ment regulation, their expected returns, and other complex conditions to choose purchase electricity in multiple markets and allocate the proportion of electricity purchases. Finally, they can achieve maximum returns and spread risks.
Assume that the spread of the sales company in the an- nual market is y1, the monthly market clearing spread is y2, the spread between the market and the market is y3, the real‐time market spread is y4, the catalog price is p0, the price of electricity purchased at all levels of the market is (p0 + yi ) ,i = 1,2,3,4. Usually, in a market environment where supply exceeds demand, the spread is positive, indicating that the market price is rising; in the market of short supply, when the spread is negative, the market price is declining. The for- mula for calculating the electricity purchase cost of the elec- tricity retailer in the wholesale market is: Regardless of the user difference in the electricity sales market, it is assumed that the spread between the electric- ity retailer and the user is a fixed value m0, that is, the aver- age price of the user's electricity is p0+m0. In general, m0 is negative. Regardless of the deviation between actual and predicted power, only the impact of market electricity price fluctuation is calculated on the value at risk of the electricity retailer, so that the combined income function of the electric- ity company can be calculated: The loss function of the electricity retailer is: 
3.2 | multi-class user sales combination model
In the multi‐user market, differentiated user packages23 are used for different types of users, which leads to differences in retail prices of electricity, which in turn affects the operating income of the electricity retailers. For the user spread, it can be divided into the following situations:
1. Designing the spread without considering the electricity purchase market
In this case, the design of the user spread package has nothing to do with the revenue of the electricity purchase market, and the user spread is prioritized. It is assumed that the user spread market is divided into four categories, specific division based on references.19 The market share of the premium market users is 𝜃1, the spread is m1, the proportion of senior market users is 𝜃2, the spread is m2, the proportion of electricity in the general market users is 𝜃3, the spread is m3, the proportion of second- ary market users is 𝜃4, and the spread is m4. Assume that the wholesale market unit purchase spread is y0, the total user de- mand for electricity is Q, so the user's market electricity sales income function is: The loss function of the electricity retailer is: 
2. Designing the spread considering the electricity purchase market
It is possible to decrease the risk of business decision mistakes or the failure of bidding in the wholesale market by binding the spread between the user market and the whole-sale market. On the basis of the market spread at the whole-sale level of electricity purchase, a certain percentage is taken as the user spread, combined with the result of the spread of the electricity purchase market. Assuming that the annual market spread is 𝜔1, the monthly market spread is 𝜔2, the market spread extraction ratio is 𝜔3, and the real‐time market spread extraction ratio is 𝜔 . It should be noted that 4 the user spread extraction is only based on the negative value of the wholesale market spread, that is, the ratio of the price reduction space, so that the profit function of the sales com- pany is:

CVaR‐optimized purchase and sale combination model
In order to solve the problem of purchase and sales electricity combination of electricity retailers in multi‐level market, the CVaR theory is used to construct a electricity retailer's elec- tricity sales optimization combination model. Through the analysis of the multi‐category users' electricity sales market, it is known that the optimal electricity purchase combination results obtained under different spread mechanisms are dif- ferent, and then, the research will be carried out separately:
1. Fixed spread mechanism
Under this situation, through the analysis of the electricity loss combination function of the electricity purchase and the loss function of the electricity sales, it can be known that the electricity combination function of the electricity retailer is:
In the above formula,=(y1,y2,y3,y4) represents the mar- ket purchase price combined vector, which is obtained from historical sample data or Monte Carlo simulation.24 In order to facilitate calculations, while obtaining user spreads m of q Sample, we define m=(m1,m2,m3,m4) as the combined vector representing the user's spread. Then the definition formula of CVaR is:
Then, optimization problems have been turned into linear
programming problems. Under the CVaR constraint, the op- timization problem of the smallest loss of electricity purchase and sales of electricity retailers is expressed as:
In the formula, 𝜁 is a defined as the level of risk. By solv- ing the model, it is possible to obtain the optimal purchase and sales combination of the electricity retailer. 𝛼 is the VaR value under the constraint of certain confidence level and risk level, which is also the maximum possible loss of the elec- tricity retailer.
2. Linkage spread mechanism
Under this kind of situation, through the analysis of the electric- ity loss combination function of the electricity purchase com- pany and the loss function of the electricity sales combination, it can be known that the electricity combination function of the electricity retailer is:
In the above formula, yT = (y1,y2,y3,y4) is the combined vector representing the market purchase price, which is obtained from historical sample data or Monte Carlo simulation y of q Samples. In order to facilitate the calculation, while obtaining the user spread difference 𝜔 of q Sample, we define 𝜔T = (𝜔 ,𝜔 ,𝜔 ,𝜔 ) as the combined vector representing the user's spread. Then the definition formula of CVaR is:
The estimated value of function is
Then, optimization problems have been turned into linear programming problems. Under the CVaR constraint, the op- timization problem of the smallest loss of electricity purchase and sales of electricity retailers is expressed as:In the formula, 𝜁 is a defined risk level. By solving the model, it is possible to obtain the optimal purchase and sales combination of the electricity retailer. 𝛼 is the VaR value under the constraint of certain confidence level and risk level, that is, the maximum possible loss of the elec- tricity retailer.
It should be noted that in the actual calculation process, the unit electricity consumption is usually targeted in order to facilitate understanding and calculation; that is, the total electricity consumption is not considered. Then, the electric- ity retailer and the user prioritize the spread, that is to say, in general, the user category composition and the spread in- formation on the sales side can be obtained in advance, and then, the combination optimization problem can simplify the purchase electricity combination xT. The model is solved by the GAMS software using CPLEX 11.0 linear solver from ILOG_solver.
Analysis of fixed spread mode
In the actual operation in electricity market, the spread of the user contract is determined in advance. Firstly, the first kind of spread mechanism is simulated and calculated in the paper. In order to simplify the calculation, the original model is simplified, and the unit electricity gain and loss is taken as the research object, so it is not affected by the market elec- tricity demand. Secondly, the classification of the user mar- ket is also based on the user evaluation results, so that the specific division results and the spread of users at all levels are shown in Table 1.
1. Initial situation of the electricity market
According to the analysis of the electricity purchase mar- ket, it is assumed that the electricity price fluctuations of all levels are subject to a normal distribution, and the average and variance figures of the electricity price spreading at all levels are estimated. The results are shown in Table 2.
Based on the estimated parameters, through the Monte Carlo simulation method, we randomly generate four groups of 100 market spread samples according to the normal distri- bution, providing data support for subsequent optimization calculations. Then, we calculate the optimal electricity distri- bution ratio and value at risk of each market under the con- fidence level 𝛽 = 0.95 in the current environment. In order to simplify the calculation process and combine the connotation of value at risk, we determine the optimal electricity distribu- tion ratio of each market and maximize the total return while the value at risk is the lowest.
While the condition that the electricity distribution at all levels is unconstrained and the confidence level is 0.95, the expected returns under different electricity distribution sce- narios and the results of VaR and CVaR are shown in Table 3.
In the case where the confidence level is 0.95, the calcula- tion shows that the optimal electricity distribution result is (1, 0, 0, 0); that is, all the electricity is purchased from the annual market. At this time, the expected profit of the sales company is 0.00176261 Yuan/kWh. When the VaR value is 0 Yuan/ kWh, there is 95% probability that the sales company loses less than 0, and the CVaR result is 0.004856 Yuan/kWh, indi- cating that the average potential loss is 0.004856 Yuan/kWh.
Figure 3 shows the mean‐CVaR effective frontier curve. It can be seen from the Figure that the larger the expected return, the smaller the conditional risk value, which seems to be different from the traditional portfolio result, but this is reasonable. By analyzing the expectations and variances of the four electricity markets, the expected return of the annual market is the highest, and the risk is the smallest, which is obviously superior to other markets. Therefore, under the unconstrained conditions of electricity distribu- tion at all levels, the annual market expects the most profit, and the risk is smallest; the largest advantage of the port- folio appears at point A; that is, the distribution ratio is (1,0,0,0). The probability of this in the mature electricity market is extremely small, but it cannot be ruled out in the electricity market where supply exceeds demand; this ex- treme phenomenon will exist and provide information for speculators.
In the previous research, most scholars have studied the future trend of China's power market based on the mature power market. However, due to the particularity of China's national conditions, the power market reform will take more time to improve. The risk that may exist in the initial stage is more worthy of study. The results in this example indicate that in the initial stage, due to the imperfect stock market, the market allocation is biased toward the medium‐ and long‐term market, which is not conducive to the healthy development of the electricity market. The risk arising from the situation suggests that market managers should be constrained by set- ting the upper and lower limits of the proportion of electricity purchased at all levels of the electricity market.
2. Mature electricity market scenario
In the actual electricity market, the actual purchase of electricity at all levels of the market is not completely dom- inated by the electricity retailer. The electricity distribution studied here is only the expected electricity distribution of the electricity retailer. In current environment, due to the instability of the spot market, the electricity price is high; electricity retailers are more inclined to buy from the me- dium‐ and long‐term markets. However, as the electricity market continues to improve, the spot market's revenue ex- pectation will be greater than the medium‐ and long‐term contract market, but the risk is still greater in the spot mar- ket. In this scenario, the electricity retailer needs to con- sider more about the electricity purchase combination. It is assumed that the electricity price fluctuations at all levels of the electricity market are still subject to a normal distri- bution, and the average and standard deviation of the elec- tricity price spreads at all levels is estimated. The results are shown in Table 4.
In the case of unconstrained market at all levels, we choose the confidence interval as β = 0.95 and 𝛽 = 0.9, then calcu- late the optimal results of the electricity distribution in both cases. The corresponding expected returns and VaR, CVaR values are shown in Table 5.
In order to obtain a curve of the combined expected return with the CVaR value, the risk level value has been changed and the above calculation has been repeated. Take the risk index CVaR as the abscissa, and the expected return as the ordinate to obtain the expected‐CVaR effective leading‐edge curve as shown in Figure 4.
It is clear from Figure 4 that under the same electricity market condition, the effective frontier curves of the 95% and 90% confidence levels are significantly different. Since the actual risks and benefits cannot be infinite, the risk level has a little interval scope, and when the risk level is too low, the model has no effective solution; when the risk level is too high, the market‐optimized combination point will have the first scenario result, that is, the optimal combination is (1,0,0,0).
Comparing the two results, we can find that as the con- fidence level increases, the risk value also increases. It can be said that the confidence level is an indicator of the risk aversion of investors. Under the same conditions, if the con- fidence level is low, the sales company pursues high returns. The proportion of the spot market will increase, indicat- ing that the electricity retailer is risk‐oriented and tending to choose the electricity purchase decision with high profit and high risk; on the contrary, when the electricity retailer is risk‐averse, the sales company will increase. The retailer purchasing electricity in the long‐term market tends to choose electricity purchase decisions with low returns and low risks.
3. Sensitivity analysis
According to the calculation results of the user market, in this example, the average spread of the user market is −0.01574 Yuan/kWh. Under the premise of the optimal elec- tricity purchase combination, the expected value of the income is affected by the user market spread as shown in Figure 5.
It can be seen from Figure 5 that the impact of the spread of the four user markets on the expected value of the income is different, and the influence of the advanced user market is the largest. The elasticity coefficient of the advanced user market spread to the expected value of the income is calcu- lated as −0.4669; in the superior user market, the elastic- ity coefficient of the market spread to the expected value of the income is −0.432; then in the ordinary user market, the elasticity coefficient of the market spread to the expected value of the income is −0.4076; finally, in the secondary user market, the elasticity coefficient of the market spread to the expected value of the income is −0.0672.
Combining the optimal electricity purchase combination and sensitivity results analysis of various scenarios, we can see that different risk‐biased electricity retailers will choose different risk levels and thus get different optimal electricity purchase combinations. As mentioned in the previous article, the purchase of electricity portfolio is only an expectation of the electricity retailer to purchase electricity in the future electricity market. It can provide effective information and data support for the electricity purchase company to make electricity purchase decisions, but in actual operation, the proportion of electricity purchase in all levels of market is not completely controlled by the electricity retailer, especially in the spot market. In more cases, it is entering the spot market to purchase electricity under the electricity deviation. Therefore, for the electricity retailer, it is necessary to allocate the pro- portion of electricity purchase in the medium‐ and long‐term electricity market and reduce the risk of purchasing electricity in the spot market, so as to effectively increase the company's maximum profit within the acceptable risk range.
4.2 | Linkage spread mode analysis
For the user linkage spread model considering the revenue of the electricity purchase market, only the mature electric- ity market environment is analyzed here, assuming that the parameters are the same as those in Table 4. For the setting of the user spread extraction ratio, combined with the fixed spread mode analysis, the setting ratio is mainly divided into two types of markets, one is the medium‐ and long‐term elec- tricity market, and the other is the spot market. The specific settings are shown in Table 6. Similarly, the normal distribution in the previous example is used to randomly generate four sets of 100 market spread samples and to provide data support for subsequent optimiza- tion calculations. We calculate the sample of the spread and obtain the expected return of the electricity purchase market and the user market, as shown in Figure 6.
It can be seen from Figure 6 that the expectation of elec- tricity purchase and the expectation of electricity sales in the medium‐ and long‐term electricity market are significantly lower than those in the spot market. The electricity spread between the medium‐ and long‐term electricity market is also lower than that of the spot market; that is, the expected profit in the medium‐ and long‐term market is less than the spot market income. However, in terms of standard deviation, the fluctuation of the spot market is significantly larger than the medium‐ and long‐term markets, which basically conforms to the trend of electricity price distribution in mature market.
Under the unconstrained situation of all levels of market, the confidence interval is chosen to be 0.95, and the opti- mal result of electricity distribution is calculated. The corre- sponding expected return and VaR, CVaR values are shown in Table 7.
In order to obtain the curve of the combined expected re- turn with the CVaR value, the risk level value is changed, and the above calculation is repeated, with the risk index CVaR as the abscissa and the expected return as the ordinate. The expected‐CVaR effective leading‐edge curve is obtained, as shown in Figure 7.
It can be seen from the Table 7 and Figure 7 that at the 95% confidence level, the risk of the electricity retailer in the linkage mode is partially transferred to the user side; the effect of the high expected return of the spot market is greatly reduced. It can be understood that even if the spot market has high returns, the dividends equally distributed to users are also high, which leads to the reduction of the sales revenue of the electricity retailer in the spot market, cou- pled with the high risk of the spot market. These factors will cause the sales companies to reduce the electricity distribu- tion in the spot market. However, for the medium‐ and long‐ term market with stable income and low risk, especially the annual market, the weakness of the difference in earnings is compensated by the low risk in the linkage spread model, and the dividend is low but the dividend distributed to the user is not low. The difference between the income and the spot market is not obvious, so the proportion of electricity distribution in the annual market is very obvious.
Through optimization calculations, it is found that under the condition of minimum risk value, the expected income of the electricity retailer is only 0.0029833 Yuan/kWh, and the risk value is also very low, only 0.0001805 Yuan/kWh, indicating that the risk is very small.
Comparing the fixed spread model and the linkage spread model analysis results, the expected‐risk situation of the two results is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8 shows the comparison of two kinds of spread modes, in which fixed 1 refers to the optimal result of the fixed spread mode, linkage 2 is the optimal result of the link- age spread mode, and fixed 2 refers to the operation result of the same electricity distribution with linkage 2; linkage 1 is the result of the calculation of the same electricity distribution as the fixed 1. It can be seen from the Figure that the risk value of the linkage spread model is significantly lower than the fixed spread model. For example, the minimum risk of the fixed spread model is significantly higher than the risk of the two linkage models; but the benefit of the linkage model is also significantly smaller than the fixed pattern. It can also be understood that the fixed spread model is applicable to risk‐appropriate sales companies, while the linkage spread model is applicable to risk‐averse sales companies.
Under the two different price difference models, the con- clusions obtained are obviously different. Although the over- all benefit of the fixed spread model is significantly higher than the linkage spread model, the linkage spread model can reduce the risk of the sales company itself through risk transfer and expectation improvement. In the previous re- search, most scholars carried out research on fixed mod- els. In the early stage of power market reform in China, the spread model will last for a long time when the reform of transmission and distribution prices is not perfect, so how to reduce risk through price linkage is worth studying.
5 | CONCLUSION
From the perspective of risk control, this paper studies the behavior of electricity retailers in purchasing and selling electricity, mainly based on the risk value theory and condi- tional risk value theory commonly used in portfolio optimi- zation theory to optimize the electricity purchase company's electricity purchase combination in multi‐level electricity market. Firstly, the paper summarizes the theory of portfo- lio optimization and focuses on CVaR theory, respectively.
Then, it constructs a multi‐level market electricity purchase combination model and multi‐user market electricity sales combination model and proposes a CVaR‐optimized pur- chase and sales combination model. Case analysis and sensi- tivity analysis were carried out. The specific conclusions of this paper include the following:
1. Under the current spread mode scenario, the market spread expectation and variance of each level have a great influence on the purchase electricity combination. When the long‐term market spread expectation and variance are better than the spot market, the optimal electricity purchase combination point appears on great value point. This is one of the problems that may be encountered in the initial stage of the power market. Market managers can avoid the risks of the entire market by controlling the upper and upper‐term market power purchase caps.
2. As the market matures, the mid‐ and long‐term market spread is expected to be smaller than the spot market, but the risk is also smaller than the spot market. The biggest advantage of the electricity purchase combination is the minimum value of CVaR. At this time, the electricity pur- chase combination is optimal under limited conditions. This conclusion ensures that the electricity market will be optimized after a period of time, and the problems in the initial stage will be resolved within the market as the mar- ket continues to improve.
3. The results of sensitivity analysis show that the changes in the market spread among different users have different elasticity to the expected changes in the sales of the elec- tricity companies, and the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient of the advanced user market is the largest. This conclusion can be used by the electricity retailers. The main source of the electricity retailer's revenue and risk in the future market is from advanced users, which should be paid attention to.
4. By comparing the results of the two spread models, it is found that the fixed spread model is applicable to risk‐ appropriate sales companies, while the linkage spread model is applicable to risk‐averse electricity retailers. This conclusion also applies to the management of the sales company, which can formulate different electricity price packages according to their own preferences, so as to increase the profit under acceptable risks.
5. Through the research in this paper, it is suggested that rel- evant policymakers should distinguish user types based on user types and improve the applicability of policies.
However, the research in this paper only considers the me- dium‐ and long‐term and spot market. In the future, the futures market will inevitably appear. Futures are also an important way of risk aversion. In considering the futures market, the research results may be more informative. These are also one of the future research directions.

41,"Trans-regional electricity transmission in China: Status, issues and strategies","In order to achieve the large-scale, long-distance and high-efficiency trans-regional electricity transmission, it is of significance to construct a strong and national smart grid with ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission system as its backbone and the coordinated development of power grids at all levels, which will enhance the resources allocation capacity of grid, promote the large-scale integration into grid of renewable energy, and further mitigate the power shortage in eastern and southern China. This paper starts with the analysis of the regional grids' supply and demand situation in China, and then analyzes the development status and existing issues of China's trans-regional electricity transmission. Finally, strategies and recommendations are proposed.","1. Introduction
In recent years, with the constant expansion of power grid and large-scale development of clean energy, trans-regional electricity transmission provides an effective way for the large-scale in- tegration into the grid of renewable energy. During the “12th Five- Year” period, China has made great efforts to develop renewable energy and new energy, and promoted the energy development strategy of building power transmission corridors, which has brought more requirements to the development of trans-regional electricity transmission in China [1].
As the world's second largest energy producing and consuming country, China is rich in energy resources, but the distribution of energy resources presents the characteristic of “poor in east and south, rich in west and north”. The energy resources are mainly concentrated in the west and north regions, while the load centers are mainly in the east and south China. In the west and north, there are abundant wind, solar and biomass energy resources, and a series of large-scale coal-electricity integrated bases and wind power bases. Currently, the installed capacity of 9 wind power bases accounts for 80% of the total wind power installed capacity, of which the five largest wind power bases are in the north, northwest and northeast China, and due to the grid consumption problems, a rather serious phenomenon of abandoned wind power occurs [2]. Meanwhile, there existed gap between power supply and demand within the jurisdiction of the State Grid Corporation of China. In 2013, with the support of trans-regional and trans-provincial power, the electric power supply and demand condition in North China, East China, Central China remained tension, and the supply of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Shandong province and so on showed power gap, of which the maximum power gap reached 13.01 million kW; In 2014, the electricity supply and demand of the State Grid showed overall balanced, however, the distribution of the remaining places remained uneven and still existed local gaps, especially in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Hebei South Grid, Shandong power grid, totaling 14 million kW maximum power shortage [3].
Therefore, in order to achieve the large-scale, long-distance and high-efficiency trans-regional electricity transmission, it is of sig- nificance to construct a strong national smart grid with ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission systems as its backbone and the co- ordinated development of power grids at all levels, which will en- hance the resources allocation capacity of grid, and further address the imbalance of regional power supply and demand [4]. This paper starts with the analysis of regional grids' supply and demand si- tuation in China, and then analyzes the development status and existing issues of China's trans-regional electricity transmission. Finally, strategies and recommendations are proposed.
2. The status of trans-regional electricity transmission in China
2.1. Supply and demand situation of regional grids
After years of development, 6 inter-provincial regional power grids, including the Northeast China Power Grid, the North China Power Grid, the Central China Power Grid, the East China Power Grid, and the Northwest China Power Grid as well as the South China Power Grid have been formed in the main land of China, as shown in Fig. 1. The supply and demand situation of different re- gional grids varies greatly. With the reverse distribution of energy resources and loads in China, the State Grid proposed the con- struction of UHV as the backbone network to interconnect large energy bases and major load centers, so as to improve the long- distance power transmission capacity of each regional grid [5].
After analyzing the electricity generating capacity and power consumption of each regional power grid for years, we can roughly draw their supply and demand situation as follows [6]:
(1) Northeast China Power Grid: the supply outstrips power de- mand, and the surplus power is more than 22 million kW. Among them, Liaoning province has a supply surplus to a certain degree, which is up to 8 million kW; Jilin and Hei- longjiang province each has a big surplus of 5 million kW; East Inner Mongolia nearly strikes a balance with a small surplus. The thermal power equipment availability hours of the whole grid are less than 4000 h. During heating supply period, wind power is difficult to consume.
(2) North China Power Grid: the overall supply and demand si- tuation is basically equilibrium. Temperature and power gen- eration coal have a great impact on the balance between power supply and demand. For instance, the supply and de- mand situation of Shandong province is grim. The maximum gap is over 5.4 million kW during summer peaks, and 2 mil- lion kW during winter peaks. Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, the south of Hebei Grid and Shandong nearly strike a balance; Shanxi power supply is generally adequate, but it still depends on the supply of power generation coal; Western Inner Mon- golia power grid has a surplus.
(3) Northwest China Power Grid: the grid has a slight surplus. Shaanxi Province nearly strikes a balance, but the supply and demand situation is influenced by the supply of power gen- eration coal; Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang has a surplus of 5 million kW, 7 million kW, 2 million kW, 6 million kW, se- parately. Wherein, Ningxia bears a heavy task of delivering electricity out and nearly strikes a balance; Qinghai has a tight surplus because of the high proportion of hydropower and the fast growing demand. In addition, Tibet has a slight surplus during the winter and summer dry seasons.
(4) Central China Power Grid: the supply and demand situation is slightly tight and affected by the supply of water and power generation coal. In dry seasons, the gap is about 10 million kW. Henan's electricity supply is tight in the summer peaks, and the gap depends on the coal supply situation; Hubei basically strikes a balance in summer, and there is a certain gap in dry seasons; Hunan and Jiangxi's supply is slightly tight; Sichuan's supply has a slightly surplus during most of periods, and there is a certain gap in dry seasons; Chongqing's power supply capacity is insufficient.
(5) East China Power Grid: the supply and demand situation is tense, especially during the summer peaks. The maximum power gap of the whole grid exceeds 12 million kW. Zhejiang's power supply capability is insufficient; Jiangsu's situation is also tense; Shanghai and Anhui nearly strikes a balance and there is a certain gap in summer peaks; Fujian's power supply surplus increases further, and is up to 4 million kW.
South China Power Grid: the supply and demand situation is tense. Lack of water and coal supply is the key factor affecting the balance between supply and demand, the maximum gap of the whole grid in the pre-flood exceeds 10 million kW, and the gap decreases slightly during summer. Guangdong's power supply and demand situation is tense, especially in the second quarter of the year; Guangxi has a power shortage during the dry seasons; Despite the reduction of exporting electricity, Guizhou's supply and demand situation is still tense, which is mainly affected by the supply of water and power generation coal; Yunnan's supply is tight and strikes a balance during the wet seasons; Hainan's overall power sup- ply and demand is basically balanced.
In the context of some grids’ irrational power structure, and that there exists a big difference in power supply and demand situation in different seasons, trans-regional power transmission and interconnection projects have played an important role, which not only effectively alleviates the power shortage in some areas, but also promotes the optimal utilization of power resources in different grids, different seasons, or different hours.
2.2 Situation of electric power consumption in regional electricity market
China's economic development has entered a new normal, under this background, electricity production and consumption also show the new normal characteristics: power supply structure continually optimizes; the growth rate of electricity consumption decreases; the main driving forces of electricity consumption growth are conversed from energy-intensive industries to emer- ging industries, service industries and residential electricity; the supply and demand situation has become loose. There is a big difference between the distribution of energy resource and elec- tricity demand in the six regional power grids. To comprehend the electricity market in China, this part will analyze the basic situa- tion of overall electricity consumption since 2008, from the as- pects of national electricity consumption and its growth rate by quarters and by regions [8–15].
In 2008, the national electricity consumption was 3426.8 bil- lion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 5.2%, 9.6% point lower than the year of 2007. According to the monthly statistics, influ- enced by the coal supply and ice disaster, the cumulative con- sumption growth rate of first two months was only 11.9%; and the rate rebounded in March with gradual disappearance of the ice disaster influence; in April, the rate began to decline gradually; and the electricity growth rates of October to December were 1.9%, 6.7%, 12%.
In 2009, the national electricity consumption was 3650.9 bil-
lion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 6.5%, 1.3% point higher than 2008. According to the monthly statistics, the electricity consumption rates have overall recovered; during the first five month, the rates were negative, and affected by economy recovery and high temperature, they turned to positive from June; finally, the electricity growth rates of September to December were 9.9%, 15.5%, 26.7%, 26.0%.
In 2010, the overall demand for electricity consumption re- mained strong. The national electricity consumption was 4192.3 billion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 14.8%. During the “11th Five-Year” period, the national average electricity growth rate was 11.09%; and the Western region's rate was up to 12.99%, ranking first in all the regions; the Northeast region's national average electricity growth rate was 8.18%, which was relatively low; the rates of Central region and Eastern region were separately 11.28% and 10.63%.
In 2011, the national electricity consumption was 4690 billion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 11.7%. Four quarters' growth rates were separately 12.9%, 11.6%, 10.8% and 11.9%, which showed a steady decline trend. In addition, the regional electricity consumption was not balanced and the difference of provincial electricity growth rates was relatively large, the electricity con- sumption growth rates of Eastern, Central, Western, and Northeast region were separately 12.9%, 11.6%, 10.8%, 11.9%.
In 2012, the national electricity consumption was 4960 billion kWh, and the year-to-year growth was 5.5%. Four quarters’ growth rates were separately 6.8%, 4.3%, 3.6% and 7.3%, which was consistent with the growth trend of GDP.
In 2013, the national electricity consumption was 5320 billion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 7.5%. Four quarters’ growth rates were separately 3.7%, 6.1%, 12.3% and 8.0%. In term of dif- ferent regions, all the regions had higher electricity consumption rates. Wherein, Western region's growth rate was 10.6%, ranking first among the six regions, and the rates of Eastern, Central and Northeast regions were separately 6.6%, 6.9%, 4.2%.
In 2014, the national electricity consumption was 5520 billion kWh, and the year-to-year growth was 3.8%. Four quarters' growth rates were separately 5.4%, 5.2%, 1.4% and 3.5%. In term of different regions, the electricity consumption of Central and Northeast regions grew slowly, with grow rates of 1.7% and 3.5%. Meanwhile, Western region's growth rate was 6.4%, ranking first again.
In 2015, the national electricity consumption was 5550 billion kW h, and the year-to-year growth was 0.5%, 3.3% point lower than 2014, which is affected by macro-economy, industrial production downward, adjustment of industrial structure, industrial trans- formation and upgrading. In term of different regions, the rate of Eastern electricity consumption to national electricity consump- tion was 48.1%, the year-to-year growth was 0.8%, and the average electricity growth rate was 4.9% during the “12th Five-Year” period; the rate of Central electricity consumption to national electricity consumption was 18.8%, the year-to-year growth was 0.2%, and the average electricity growth rate was 5.3% during the “12th Five- Year” period; the rate of Western electricity consumption to na- tional electricity consumption was 26.8%, the year-to-year growth was 0.8%, and the average electricity growth rate was 8.5% during the “12th Five-Year” period; the rate of Northeast electricity con- sumption to national electricity consumption was 6.3%, the year- to-year growth was 0.8%, and the average electricity growth rate was 2.9% during the “12th Five-Year” period;.
Based on the above analysis, this paper concludes the Eastern, Western, Central, and Northeast regions’ national electricity con- sumption. And acquires the forecast value of the consumption in the future by using the linear prediction trend line, as shown in Fig. 2 (To be noted, electricity consumption structure in this figure is referred to the rate of region electricity consumption to national electricity consumption). As can be seen from the figure, the electricity consumption in 2016 will continue to maintain a low growth rate. According to “National electricity supply and demand analysis and forecast report (2015–2016)”, the national electricity consumption is expected to 5600–5660 billion kW h, and the year- to-year growth will be 1–2% [15].
2.3. Scale of trans-regional electricity transmission trading
With the rapid development of the whole society and economy, trans-regional consumption continues to increase. In 2013, trans- regional electricity trading of the State Grid Corporation was up to 352.768 billion kW h, with an increase of 9.38%, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3. While the electricity North China purchased in 2013 increased by 20.60% than the 12th-five start year; the electricity of Northwest sent up to north and central grid is 48.179 billion kW h, an increase of 21.57%. In 2014, the trans-regional electricity trading of State Grid Corporation regional cross-trading reached 391.2 bil- lion kW h, an increase of 10.89%. Overall, the flexible operation of trans-regional trading has greatly promoted the change of western region's resource advantages into economic advantages, ensured to meet the eastern load centers’ demand for electricity, and advanced the optimal allocation of resources and the balanced development of regional economy in China [8,9,16–19].
In 2014, the trans-regional and provincial electricity trading of State Grid Corporation completed a total 725.2 billion kW h, and trans-regional electricity trading to "" Central, North, and East China"" accumulated 391.2 billion kW h, reducing the region 133.01 million tons of standard coal combustion, carbon dioxide emis- sions 345.82 million tons. Electricity through transactions trans- ported cross to Beijing, Shanghai and other cities was 37.9 billion kW h, 38 billion kW h, respectively, reducing local coal burning 12.89 million tons, 12.94 million tons, and carbon dioxide emis- sions 33.52, 33.64 million tons. Meanwhile, the Grid took ad- vantage of UHV grid, increased support efforts cross regional and provincial, to realize an annual hydropower delivery of electricity 112.2 billion kW h of Sichuan, an increase of 62.3%; to achieve wind power, photovoltaic and other new energy 19 billion kW h, increase by 90.0% [20,21].
However, there still exists a few constraints in trans-regional transmission capacity, for example, about 30 million kW electricity from Northeast China, West Inner Mongolia and Northwest China still cannot be transferred to the east and central tension regions, resulting in a situation where ""power shortage at demand side"" and ""power surplus at supply side"" coexist.
2.4. Major trans-regional transmission corridors
The construction of trans-regional power grids of the State Grid ensured the Three Gorges Power Grid to be strong and reliable, and achieved the interconnection of the Central China Power Grid and China Southern Power Grid, the Northwest Power Grid and the North China Power Grid. In addition, the interconnection of the Central China Power Grid and East China Power Grid, the Northeast China Power Grid and North China Power Grid was strengthened. Thus power transmission from west to east, mutual aid of north and south, a nationwide interconnection have been initially realized. As the important trans-regional corridors of China in 2014 are shown in Fig. 4, these channels generally runs well, and effectively alleviate the tensions in eastern China. However, many trans-regional transmission projects just inter- connect two regions which are the same power shortage or sur- plus areas, so they are failure to adjust the demand and supply situations [22].
Based on the above figures, a brief introduction of current major trans-regional transmission corridors is given as follows:
(1) Northwest-Central: There are 7500 kV Lingbao direct current (DC) and Debao (Baoji-Deyang) DC two transmission lines, transferring the thermal power from the Northwest Power Grid to Central China Power Grid, which effectively alleviates 
(2)Northwest-North: 7 660 kV Yinchuan-Shandong DC trans- mission line, transfers the thermal power in Northwest China to Shandong, greatly easing the power shortage in the eco- nomic and social development of Shandong.
South Hami -Zhengzhou: 7800 kV South Hami -Zhengzhou HVDC transmission line, transfers power from South Xinjiang Hami to Zhengzhou, Henan, making great significance to promote resource advantages into economic advantages, and ease power shortage in central China.

(3)Northeast-North: Gaoling DC transmission line transfers ade- quate thermal and wind power to North China, which is an effective solution to wind power exporting problem in Northeast China.
(4)North-Central: 1000 kV Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen ultra-high-voltage alternating current (UHVAC) transmission line achieves a mutual aid of wind and thermal power in North China Power Grid and Central China Power Grid.
(5) Central-East:
7800 kV Xiangjiaba-shanghai ultra-high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission is the main corridor among the west to east power transmission lines, transferring hydropower from the downstream Jingshajiang to east. Every year Shanghai re- ceives 32 billion kW h from this line, accounting for 1/4 of the total electricity consumption in Shanghai.
7500 kV Gezhouba-Shanghai Nanqiao UHVDC transmission line transfers hydropower from Gezhouba to Shanghai, effec- tively improving the power supply capability of Shanghai.
7 500 kV Longzheng, Yihua, Linfeng DC transmission lines transfer Three Gorges hydropower to East China, effectively solving the power shortage in East China and greatly improving the economy and reliability of the grid.
7 800KV Xiluodu-Zhejiang west HVDC transmission lines transfer Yibin Shuanglong hydropower to Zhejiang Jinhua, de- livering about 40 billion kW h to the load center of east China, to achieve energy efficiency and emission reduction targets. 7800 kV Jinping-Sunan HVDC transmission lines Sichaun Yu- long to Jiangsu Tongli, undertaking the west to east hydropower transmission of Jinping I, II stage in Yalong River downstream and Guandi hydropower station, Which could meet the growing demand of East meet the for electricity.
(6) Central-South: 7500 kV Jiangcheng DC transmission is the only channel interconnecting Three Gorges and Southern Grid, greatly easing Guangdong's pressure on power supply.
(7) West Inner Mongolia-North: 500 kV Fengquan-Wangquan, Hanhai-Guyuan-Pingancheng AC transmission lines deliver abundant thermal and wind power in West Inner Mongolia out to North China, mitigating the large power surplus in West Inner Mongolia and the supply tension in North China Power Grid.
2.5. Development and planning
During“the 11th Five-Year”period, trans-regional power grids ushered the large-scale construction peak, the accumulative in- vestment in the State Grid reached 47.208 billion CNY, and the total number of construction projects achieved 30 (39 lines and 36 stations), among which the length of AC lines was 3385 km, sub- station capacity of 409 kVA, DC lines of 5745 km, commutation capacity of 33.2 million kW. In January 2009, the world's first 1000 kV UHVAC transmission project, known as the Jindongnan- Nanyang-Jingmen UHVAC transmission project, was put into op- eration, marking China's grid development has entered a new stage of UHV power grid as a symbol. In 2011, the trans-regional transmission capacity of the State Grid improved significantly, in which UHV expansion, Qinghai-Tibet interconnection, Yingdong DC, Linfeng DC and other large number of important transmission projects were built and put into operation, and trans-regional transmission capacity reached 266.4 billion kW h, equivalent to long-distance transportation of 90 million tons standard coal [23].
The “12th Five-Year” plan referred to “adapting to the require- ments of building a large-scale trans-regional transmission and new energy generation network, and accelerating the construction of a modern grid system"", which can further expand the scale of electric power, and improve the regional trunk grid. The State Grid Cor- poration has announced that North, East, Central China UHV power grid will form a ""three vertical, three horizontal and one ring”and 13 long-distance tributary transmission projects will be constructed with the total investment of 500 billion CNY [24], as shown in Fig. 5.
On the basis of technical research and engineering practice constantly advancing, the State Grid Corporation carried out scrolling grid planning studies, forming a relatively complete planning system. During the year 2011–2020, the construction of smart grid will be comprehensive developed [25]. Plan until to 2020, makes out to build Huainan-Nanjing -Shanghai, XiMeng- Shandong, West Inner Mongolia-Tianjin and several other UHV engineering projects, to meet the demands for large amount of power delivery needs of southwest hydropower, west and north coal, wind power and solar power and other large energy bases. The nation forms ""Central, North, and East China"" and the north- east, northwest, southwest, and south five synchronous network, where the northeast, northwest, southwest, and south grid asyn- chronously interconnect with "" Central, North, and East China"" UHV synchronous grid via HVDC and UHV, forming the new pat- tern of West to east, the North-South, water and fire Freemasons, wind and solar energy optimal allocation. By then, the State Grid Corporation would greatly enhance ability to optimize the allo- cation of resources, effective protection of large coal, hydropower, nuclear power and renewable energy generation and consumption of power.
Currently, UHV lines which have been put into operation and under construction are as follows (shown in Table 2).
Overall, major achievements of China's trans-regional grids construction have played a great role in the promotion of electric power industry. Firstly, trans-regional grids construction develops primary energy more economically and rationally, optimizes the allocation of energy resources, and achieves mutual aid of hydro and thermal power. Secondly, it reduces the total peak electricity load by interconnecting power grids, improves turbine efficiency, and results in better load shifting benefits. Thirdly, it reduces re- serve capacities sharply. Then, it greatly improves the reliability of grid operation and quality of power supply, and better ensures the safe use of electricity. Finally, installation of high efficiency, low cost, large capacity units and the construction of large-scale power plants can generate greater economies of scale.
2.6. Analysis of trans-regional policies
In recent years, in order to strengthen the construction of en- ergy base supporting power transmission project and adequately solve the development and consumption of new energy, China has vigorously reinforced trans-regional channel construction and lay down a series of policies supporting trans-regional trading based on the supply and demand situation, as shown in Table 3.
The above policies cover the construction of trans-regional transmission corridors, trans-regional trading rules, price man- agement, short-term supporting mechanism, supervision man- agement and other aspects. These policies are important driving forces and security forces to promote the rapid development of trans-regional trading. On the basis of balancing the interests of each market entity, they help to protect the safety and stable op- eration of power grid, and optimize the allocation of resources in a larger scale region.
3. The issues of trans-regional electricity transmission in China
3.1. Trading issues
3.1.1. Imperfect price formation mechanism of trans-regional power trading
At present, the common trans-regional electricity trading me- chanism is the listed transaction organized by regional grid com- pany. The electricity capacity and tariffs are determined by grid companies, then qualified power generation companies within the region bid downward for sale, and those generation companies offering lower charging price will get extra generating opportu- nities. The trading mechanism is actually a unilateral trading mechanism in which tariffs cannot be negotiated. Benchmark price developed by grid companies only relates to the interests of en- terprises ignoring that of power generation companies. Mean- while, this listed price does not consider the power supply and demand situation in the needed region, even if the region demand is urgent, the power supply region still need to deliver the elec- tricity out at a lower price [26,27]. Therefore, this trading me- chanism fails to mitigate the situation where ""power shortage at demand side"" and ""power surplus at supply side"" coexist.
Take Lingbao and Debao DC lines for example, in the year of 2012, Lingbao engineering transmission price was approved by 45 yuan/thousand kW h, execution by a single system; Debao DC project price was approved by 44.14 yuan/thousand kW h, accord- ing to the two-part tariffs, and the ratio of capacity and electricity tariffs price was 3:7 [28]. The transmission loss rate of Lingbao and Debao HVDC was approved by 1% and 3%, the actual running above or below the value part would be charged by the State Grid Cor- poration. In a centralized listed trading of trans-regional electricity transmission Northwest China Power Grid organized, 27 thermal power generation companies bided for sale, and the total declaring electricity capacity was 7.728 billion kW h, while the final total clearing capacity was 1.709 billion kW h. Clearing results have shown that the average power delivering to the central China in November decreased by over 30%. Tracing it to its cause, the in- creasing price of power generation coal resulted in the generation cost higher than the benchmark price. The electricity exported at benchmark price was limited; thereby the exporting capacity of the Northwest China Power Grid was also reduced.

41,"Trans-regional electricity transmission in China: Status, issues and strategies","In order to achieve the large-scale, long-distance and high-efficiency trans-regional electricity transmission, it is of significance to construct a strong and national smart grid with ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission system as its backbone and the coordinated development of power grids at all levels, which will enhance the resources allocation capacity of grid, promote the large-scale integration into grid of renewable energy, and further mitigate the power shortage in eastern and southern China. This paper starts with the analysis of the regional grids' supply and demand situation in China, and then analyzes the development status and existing issues of China's trans-regional electricity transmission. Finally, strategies and recommendations are proposed.","3.1.2. Lower market degree in trans-regional power trading
According to the formation mechanism of electricity price and capacity, trans-regional power transmission can be divided into two categories: planned trading and market-directed trading. Nowadays, planned trading which lacks a flexible matched ad- justment mechanism is dominant in China. The long-term power trading volume, whose electricity capacity and price are de- termined by the national or local government, accounts for 4/5 of the total trans-regional power trading volume, in which the listed transaction accounts for about 1/7, and the market-directed trad- ing volume is less than 1/20 [29]. Owing to that the planned si- tuation is greatly different from the actual supply and demand, the planned trading is difficult to adapt to the changes in the market, and the trading volume cannot be adjusted flexibly. In addition, the planned trading price cannot accurately reflect the real value and scarcity of electric power, or even causes inefficient allocation phenomenon where the planned power flow is in the opposite direction of primary energy, which will limit the market's role in the optimal allocation of resources.
Take the Central China Power Grid for example. In May 2012, in order to absorb the surplus hydropower, thermal power genera- tion in a few provinces of central China reached the minimum generation capacity. In mid-June, parts of hydropower stations in Sichuan and Chongqing appeared the phenomenon of abandoning hydro. However, in accordance with the annual planned arrange- ment, the Central China Power Grid still had to receive 350 million kW h from the North China, which did not match with the actual market situation [30]. It can be seen that when the planned and actual supply and demand have a greater deviation, the efficiency of resources allocation would be affected owing to the imperfect market adjustment mechanism.
3.1.3. Non-standard trans-regional power trading behaviors
Now the trans-regional power transmission in China is mainly based on the planned trading through signing long-term contracts for more than one year. When the contract capacity deviates from the actual situation, the grid companies in favor of market-direc- ted trading would attribute the deviation to power generation corporations and organize power generation corporations a sec- ond time to carry out temporary listed transactions. But the transmission prices in temporary transactions are often lower than the national approving exporting electricity prices, which causes losses to power generation companies. Also, because the existing transmission prices deciding mechanism sets the upper limit, a certain grid companies cannot split a transmission trading into multiple financial transactions to collect transmission fees re- peatedly from the power flowed-through provinces by increasing the transmission prices [29]. It can be seen that non-standard trans-regional power transactions make market justice reduce significantly.
Take Xinjiang Electric Power Company and the Central China Power Grid for example. In June 2012, The State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) in China published the regulatory report of power trading prices in 2011. The report said that there exist many links, high standards, overcharging and other issues related to transmission fees of grid enterprises, in which Xinjiang Electric Power Company overcharged transmission fees of about 97 million CNY, and Central China Power Grid transmission over- charged 64.8 million CNY [31]. Overcharged transmission fees hinder trans-regional power trading to some degree.
3.1.4. The effects of trans-regional trading on the inter-provincial trading
In recent years, the capacity of trans-regional power trans- mission corridors has been enhanced. But the expansion of trans- regional trading affects the inter-provincial trading to some extent, causing the resources originally allocated among provinces to be delivered out of the region.
Take the Central China for example [32]. With the rapid ex- pansion of trans-regional trading, the inter-provincial trading has shrunk dramatically. In 2010, due to the strengthening of the ex- porting channels, a large amount of hydropower in Sichuan were allocated to the Northwest and East China, and the inter-provincial hydro contingency transaction capacity decreased by 1.71 billion kWh correspondingly. Part of resources were allocated outside the region even if the demand of Central China has not been meet. According to power balance forecasts, during June to September in 2011, Sichuan Power Grid has delivered 6.6 million kW out, while it also had a gap of 776,000 kW.
3.2. Trans-regional corridors issues
3.2.1. Improper trans-regional corridors construction
As the power shortage spreads and intensifies in China, the construction of a certain transmission corridors in an urgent need still seems light-years away, while other projects that are not ur- gent were launched quickly and built smoothly. Some transmis- sion corridors interconnect two regions which are both in short of electricity or surplus of electricity. It can be seen that improper construction of trans-regional transmission corridors fails to reg- ulate power surplus and deficiency.
Take West Inner Mongolia Power Grid for example. Back in the 1980 s, there were two channels from Inner Mongolia to North China, i.e. ""Fengquan-Wangquan"" and ""Hanhai-Guyuan-Pingan- cheng"" 500 kV EHV lines. But later, as the country's largest electric power exporting base, West Inner Mongolia did not build an ex- porting channel for many years. The annual loan interests bought by idle generation units are more than two billion. In recent years, in order to import electricity, Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong and other provinces and cities have signed transmission protocols with Inner Mongolia but in vain. In order to sell electricity, Inner Mongolia has proposed to speed up the outgoing channel con- struction, which still has not become a reality [33]. Instead, in August 2006, the pilot demonstration project of Shanxi-Hubei 1000 kV UHVAC was approved and started in the same month, and put into operation 28 months later. This investment of over 50 billion plays a tiny role, because in Shanxi and Hubei, as the country's most severe power shortage areas, no extra power is available for exporting [34].
3.2.2. ""Partially passable"" of certain trans-regional transmission corridors
In addition to that the project construction is lagging behind or the new project is useless, institutional problems causing trans- regional transmission corridors ""partially passable"" are worth being reflected. The ""partially passable"" problem not only wastes transmission corridor resources, but also exacerbates the situation where ""power shortage at demand side"" and ""power surplus at supply side"" coexist.
Take the transmission from West Inner Mongolia Power Grid to
North China for example [35]. From July 1, 2011, the North China Power Grid canceled the temporary electricity exporting transac- tions of West Inner Mongolia Power Grid. West Inner Mongolia Power Grid delivers electricity out to North China through two channels, and the maximum transmission capacity has been up to 4.3 million kW, if a little technological innovation occurs, it can reach 4.9 million kW. After the notice enforcement, the lowest exporting power fell to 1.975 million kW with idle capacity of over 2 million kW. Thus the power shortage situation of North China Power Grid was more severe.
3.3. Controversy over the technology roadmap of trans-regional power transmission
Regarding the technology roadmap of trans-regional power transmission, the controversy has been focused on choosing UH- VAC or UHVDC. UHVDC has little line loss, can be operated alone and independent of each other, and saves wire. UHVAC is easy to be scheduled, but the transmission loss is great, and may expand the scope of power outages due to a domino effect caused by fluctuations. The uniform understanding of power transmission technology programs, or interest conflict among different de- partments, to a certain extent, delays the approval and construc- tion of trans-regional power transmission projects, thereby al- lowing the ""institutional power shortage"" to spread widely and longer.
In recent years, construction investment of the State Grid Cor- poration continued to increase. The grid investment funds amounted to 338.5 billion in 2014, increasing 14.1% over 2013; in 2015, grid investment plans to be 420.2 billion, increasing 24% [23]. The State Grid Corporation will construct a UHV backbone network covering North, East, Central China, and 13 long-distance tributary transmission projects. The State Grid Corporation tries to use UHVAC to interconnect the north, east and central three major regional power grids into a unified independent power grid, but some power experts strongly considers that it is unsafe, inefficient, wasting a lot, covering much land, and will further strengthen the already highly centralized power grid monopoly system. The UHVDC can only achieve long-distance transmission with less loss, but cannot form a complete unity grid, which still arouses wide- spread controversy.
3.4. Game of multiple interests in trans-regional power transmission
After each trans-regional power transmission corridor is put into operation, the original power supply and demand situation in needed regions will be changed, as well as the power supply subjects. In addition, the trans-regional power transmission lines are becoming longer by flowing through many provinces and ci- ties. Correspondingly, the interests bodies are increasing and ori- ginal interests’ allocation methods are changed. Thus there exists a game of multiple interests in the re-established power supply and demand situation.
Take Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV line for example [36]. After it was put into operation, North and Central China power grids can give full play to mutual aid of hydro and thermal power, peak shaving and load shifting. The construction of power stations in Shanxi can not only continue to develop local coal industry, but also boost local revenues. However, the amount of purchased coal in Hubei has reached up to 97%, if continues to construct power plants, coal costs will be higher. And when UHV completed, Hubei can only become a transmission channel, and power plants ori- ginally built in the local area will be built in Shanxi instead, thus the tax revenues will belong to Shanxi. As can be seen, Shanxi takes ""cheese"" from Hubei. Meanwhile, the construction of UHV also moved ""cheese"" of the railway sector. For example, transfer- ring electricity of 1.2 million kW from Changzhi in Shanxi to Jingmen is equivalent to the transportation of 20 million tons of coal [24]. UHV projects involve interests of many provincial cities and counties, which will be a game process.
4. Strategies and recommendations
4.1. Building a sound trans-regional power trading market
4.1.1. Perfecting the formation mechanism of trans-regional power trading price
(1) Trans-regional power trading should stick to negotiated mar- ket pricing mechanism. On one hand, negotiated market pri- cing mechanism should be in accordance with the direction of electricity market reform, which helps to foster market awareness, and promotes the construction of electricity mar- ket; on the other hand, the prices determined by negotiated market pricing ought to fit in the power supply and demand situation, are able to reflect the market supply and demand as well as scarcity of resources. At the same time, this mechanism should guide power investment reasonably, and impel trans- regional power trading [37–39].
(2) On-grid tariff should be slightly lower than the price which is equivalent to average electricity purchasing price minus a reasonable transmission fee. This pricing principle embodies the core concept of market-determined prices, rather than the traditional way which the price is determined. The core of trans-regional power trading market is to take the acceptance of consumers at the receiving end as the sole criterion. The principle of “the user is God"" still applies to trans-regional power trading, which means that break-even price, meager profit price, or marginal price determined by power genera- tion companies from their own costs or benefits point of view, if not accepted by users, are useless. The reason why on-grid tariff should be based on the electricity purchasing price at the receiving end is that the decreased power generation of the receiving regions should be compensated. Meanwhile, the value-added tax, corporate income tax and surtax of power generation corporations of the receiving regions should be reduced considering the electric power and energy con- sumption, amount of investment, resource ownership, na- tional policies, and other issues ought to be taken care of. The main purpose is to encourage the initiatives in receiving electricity [40–42].
(3) The fee of trans-regional transmission should be decided reasonably. Reasonable transmission prices are the key to the market role in allocation of resources and the improvement of policies. The general transmission pricing principle is the same as the normal transmission pricing, i.e. “reasonable costs, reasonable returns, fair burden”, which is conducive to guiding grid investment, improving grid structure, promoting the es- tablishment and development of regional electricity market, and meeting the needs of economic and social development. To be specific, different mechanisms and approaches can be adopted for dedicated or utility transmission lines, fixed or temporary power transmission plans. For dedicated trans- mission lines or fixed power transmission plans, transmission and distribution tariff should be in accordance with the na- tional principles and guidelines. For utility transmission lines or temporary power transmission plans, transmission and distribution tariff should be decided through negotiation among the sending, receiving, and transferring aspects according to the market demand and supply situation, but the government price departments and electricity regulatory in- stitutions must build a platform to develop rules to determine the pricing and distribution principles, and supervise trans- actions and prices in order to ensure that the transactions are fair and reasonable [43,44].
4.1.2. Improving market degree of trans-regional power trading
From the perspective of the overall direction of electric power development and reform, China should stick to market-oriented reforms, increase market competition factors, introduce the com- petition to the transmission side, and use government planning instruments to curb unhealthy competition and regulate market competitive prices in appropriately. National Energy Administra- tion of China and its regional and provincial regulatory agencies should supervise the whole bidding process, expand power gen- eration corporations’ right to participate and know, enliven the market atmosphere, and promote the healthy and prosperous development of market transactions [45].
4.1.3. Regulating trans-regional power trading behaviors
At present, market behaviors which need to be regulated are as follows: firstly, under the original system, transactions organized by internal planning still exist, making the willingness of market players at the generation side weaken; secondly, hedging or relay transactions to lower the on-grid tariff of power generation companies, which is equivalent to lifting price in a disguised form; thirdly, the mechanism of generation companies directly involved in trans-regional trading has not yet formed, and grid enterprises still act as agencies, thus the will of power generation companies and the true value of power resources are not fully reflected in a certain transactions; fourthly, under the existing mechanism, some transactions charge transmission and network loss com- pensation fees based on the generation provided in the contract, or charge repeatedly; last but not least, the settlement of individual transactions is not timely formed, and the quantity of electricity exported at a lower price in certain grid is larger [46].
4.1.4. Strengthening supervision and make clear regulatory focus
In trans-regional power trading, regulatory bodies should su- pervise the whole transaction process at the right moment. At the same time, but must have a focus. At the grid side, market auction should be promoted. As long as the rules are well formulated, reg- ulatory authorities need to supervise the competition of electric power enterprises in accordance with the rules only. In the transfer links, after transmission and distribution prices are determined by the government, it is needed to supervise power grid enterprises’ implementation strictly, and unreasonable transmission fee should be mainly focused. At the sales side, the regulation should simply follow the relevant provisions. Hedging, relay and other transactions should be treated distinctly. Overall, regulatory agencies should strengthen the supervision of information disclosure, improve the transparency of trading information, and evaluate as well as monitor the rationality of trans-regional power transmission [47,48].
With the increasing trading volume and complexity of trans- actions, relevant provisions and methods cannot be adapted to the current needs of transactions. Electricity regulators should pay close attention to the development of more sophisticated methods and regulations so as to promote the healthy and orderly devel- opment of trans-regional trading.
4.2. Strengthening configuration construction of trans-regional, sending and receiving end
In order to solve the problems existing in trans-regional power transmission corridors, mitigate the situation of coexistence of ""power shortage at demand side"" and ""power surplus at supply side"" as well as transferring the western surplus electricity to eastern load centers to achieve the fully utilization of power re- sources, and ensure that the electricity is able to be delivered out or received, it is imperative to strengthen the configuration con- struction of trans-regional, sending and receiving end grids [49– 51].
(1) The preparatory work of power grid construction projects should be taken care of. The smooth progress of the pre- paratory work of power grid construction projects has prac- tical significance for promoting the construction of the whole grid. Therefore, in the early stage of grid construction, com- munication and coordination of all the aspects should be fully strengthened, creating a favorable external environment and institutional guarantee for the smooth progress of power grid construction projects.
(2) The power grid transformation and optimization should be improved simultaneously. In parallel with the grid transfor- mation, China should be fully aware of the significance of grid optimization, and make efforts to develop make the grid an optimized one with the characteristics of reasonable layout, safe and reliable structure, flexible scheduling and operation, stable performance, high level of intelligence, and low power loss.
(3) Increase the UHV power grid construction investment. In or- der to meet the electricity transmission demand of long-dis- tance, high-capacity and high-quality due to the growing load, high voltage transmission lines have been unable to meet the load requirements of trans-regional power transmission. Un- der the premise of minimizing transmission loss as much as possible, UHV power transmission projects have become in- evitable to generate economy of scale.
(4) The configuration construction of sending and receiving end should be strengthened. To ensure that electricity is able to be delivered or received, and avoid that trans-regional power transmission capacity is idle or wasted, it is necessary to strengthen the configuration construction of sending and re- ceiving end grids.
4.3. Broadening financing channels for power grid construction
Grid construction projects have stringent technical require- ments, huge capital demand, long construction period, especially UHV and EHV power grid construction. To meet the huge invest- ment capital needs, we must widely open financing channels to achieve the diversification of grid investment. Firstly, grid invest- ment market should be open to all aspects in the markets to promote the reform of power grid investment system and adopt open forms in transmission and distribution sectors, as well as allowing the entry of private capital. Secondly, the management of construction costs should be improved, besides, the level of input and output will be raised, and further enhance power grid en- terprises’ profits. Last but not least, the traditional financing methods should be improved, and actively explore new financing channels to provide financial support for the subsequent devel- opment of trans-regional power grid [52].
4.4. Realizing the coordinated development of power generation and grid
Due to the long-existing managerial problem that the genera- tion side has achieved more investment than transmission and demand sides, China's power grid construction has been lagging behind the power generation construction. In the situation where power generation and transmission are separate, establishing scientific and rational power planning systems and mechanisms to achieve the coordinated development of power grid and genera- tion plays an important role in adjusting the national energy structure, improving the overall quality and efficiency of the en- ergy industry, and ensuring the security and stability of the na- tional grid operation. Although the long-term plan will improve the grid structure and increase transmission channels, large-scale construction of power transmission lines is of urgent need of the approval of National Development and Reform Commission of China. With the fact that capital is very tight nowadays, China gives priorities only to a certain range of grid construction pro- jects, resulting in a waste of resources and that the capacity of some transmission channels will have no major change in the short term [53–55]. So, whether it is power generation construc- tion, or grid construction, China should make a good plan for co- ordinated development between them to maximize the utilization of energy resources and transmission channels' capacity.
4.5. Developing reasonable trans-regional power transmission tax policies
Under the current tax system, as for inter-provincial tax im- balance and value added tax transfer issues related to large trans- regional power investment projects, it is recommended that value- added tax, corporate income tax and surtax should be assigned under the principle of efficiency, fairness, investment and re- sources compensation, considering the electric power and energy consumption, amount of investment, resource ownership, national policies( which favors the western region) and other factors, in order to encourage the export and import of electricity [56,57]. In addition, the above methods should be implemented through consultations among provinces, with little or no change to the current tax system and the relevant national laws and regulations.
5. Outlook
In the context of the large-scale integration of renewable en- ergy into grid and the sustained growth of total electricity con- sumption, accelerating the construction of trans-regional power grids embodies the view of scientific development of power grid enterprises, and is a crucial guarantee for meeting future growing demand for electricity. Also, it is an important way to achieve in- ter-regional and inter-basin with the utilization of hydro and thermal power, and to optimize the allocation of energy resources. In addition, it is a carrier to build a national electricity market. But there are still many problems in the vigorous development of trans-regional power transmission. Therefore, China should ac- celerate the transformation of power grid development mode, establish an open and orderly electricity market system in line with national conditions, give full play to the energy transmission and market functions of power grids, and strive to make new contributions to the fast economic and social development. The magnificent blueprint of a strong national grid taking UHV as core has been drawn, and China's trans-regional power grid construc- tion and transmission trading will be more prosperous in the future."
42,Transforming China's electricity sector: Politics of institutional change and regulation,"The political failure of China's first independent regulator in a strategic industry – the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), 2002–2013 – provides a natural experiment to uncover fundamental challenges to a gradualist approach to electricity market formation. Taking a political institutional approach, we show that while it was largely predictable that the breakup of the monopolistic power industry in 2002 created bureaucratic and corporate interests that would undercut the institutional role of SERC, subsequent difficulties in reforming electricity pricing, dispatch system, and integrating renewable energy sources strongly suggests that a central regulatory body would be necessary to lead a decisive transition to a market-based electricity market.","1. Introduction
China has become the second largest electric power market in the world, running the world's biggest electricity system that produces around 25% of the world's electricity and more than 7% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. The annual value of electricity sales are up to $600 bn and annual new investment is around $137 bn, EPRG (2017).2 It is predicted that the Chinese power industry will invest over two trillion US dollars in the next 30 years, and that the nation's purchasing of power generation equipment alone will account for some 32% of the world's total. Indeed, according to China Electricity Council (CEC) data, China's total installed power capacity had reached 1777 GW (gigawatt) in 2017, following a 10% plus annual growth rate since 2008.3 Per capita consumption was low at around 3927 KWh (kilowatt hour) in 2014, suggesting a massive expansion of power infrastructure would be necessary if China's consumption is to approach the global average.4 Even with the slowing GDP growth, it has been estimated that by 2030 China's power consumption will range between 5830 kWh and 8580 kWh per capita (He et al., 2015).5
To counter these enormous expectations and to support the development of China's electricity sector, the government laun- ched a series of reforms at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s with a view to creating a more dynamic power market structure and to establishing a rational regulatory framework. The first time that China's electricity industry became subject to legislative control was with the passing of the first national electricity law in 1995 that guaranteed the development of the electric power in- dustry and pledged to safeguard the legal rights and interests of investors, operators and users of electric power.6 It was a land- mark legislation that set the next stage of reforms in 2002 with the creation of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) to establish a coherent bureaucratic framework for regulating the power sector. It also led to key regulations to supervise and reg- ulate electricity-related issues such as pricing of electricity, and issuing and managing electric business permits that were pro- mulgated in 2005 with a view to expand market forces. By 2013, however, SERC was folded into the National Energy Administra- tion (NEA) that was established five years earlier, taking the fall for a decade of top-down reform initiatives that have not pro- duced greater marketization of the power sector or enhanced domestic energy security.7 In 2015, industrial policy direction shifted from privatization toward electricity price reform, elec- tricity trading mechanism reform, dispatch plan reform, reduction of curtailment of renewable energy, and the opening up of dis- tribution and retail business to new investors (Liu, 2015). How- ever, the unfinished business of SERC has hung over Chinese planners. Leading up the National People's Congress session in March 2018, business media reported Chinese planners’ intention to re-establish a dedicated energy ministry to oversee the coun- try's vast oil, natural gas, coal and power sectors.8 Surprisingly, this proposal fell through, leaving the electricity sector in an unsustainable state of reform impasse and regulatory un- certainties.
We argue that SERC's decade-long tenure should be understood as a political failure, for the agency was unable to wrangle away power from entrenched interests to achieve the political superiors’ top priorities of marketization, energy security, and ecological protection. However, SERC's demise confirms China's need for a ministerial-level independent regulator, for the alternatives of a weak agency in NEA and greater market domination of the grid and generation companies have displaced Beijing from the driver's seat in steering the reform momentum. As a result, the current path of reform toward a more “market” based solution – defined in the State Council Document 9 of 2015 - will likely result in disorganised deregulation that will per- petuate chronic supply and demand imbalances and hampered China's transition to renewable sources.
The article is divided into three sections. The first section critically reviews the relevant comparative literature on industrial regulation, underlining China's complex and multipolar political landscape of government and corporate players for achieving the necessary au- tonomy of a regulatory state. The second section assesses the evolu- tion of China's electricity sector, following four reform priorities and key developments that have come to define long-term challenges to marketization. The third section discusses the problematic alignment of industrial interests behind China's power sector reforms from SERC's establishment to its demise and the subsequent regulatory proxies. The conclusion considers the legacy of earlier partial reforms on Beijing's current push for marketization.9
2. The emergence of a regulatory state In China
The case study of the independent regulator in the power sector focuses on the political preconditions for and proper in- stitutional role of the central government in expediting market formation the post-socialist planning environment. It reflects on three related themes in the interdisciplinary literatures on reg- ulatory capitalism: 1) increasing pressures on the state in sup- porting domestic firms’ global market competitiveness, discussed as “new industrial policy” for advanced economies (Rodrik, 2004) and “regulatory state” in China (Lin, 2005; Pearson, 2005); 2) “regulatory diffusion” (Levi-Faur, 2005; Jarvis, 2009, 2010) as states - under advice from international organizations and aiming to attract foreign capital - seek to adopt standard policy packages and institutional templates for sectoral governance; and 3) an anti-liberal model of “state capitalism” (Buzan and Lawson, 2014; McNally, 2012) that seems to converge with the resilience of au- thoritarian regimes since what Samuel Huntington called the “third wave of democratization” in the 1990s. Each of these per- spectives emphasizes a set of state-market relations that generate specific demand for increased regulations, while sharing a gen- eral, critical assessment of the Chinese central state for not put- ting in place functional capacities to steer the electricity market in a difficult dual transition toward market governance and greater input of renewable energy. Taken together the comparative the- oretical insights point to the necessity of a central regulatory agency in effecting this transition.
A liberal strand of understanding of the rise of the “regulatory state” in China predicts bureaucratic adaptation to the pre- dominance of market transactions with the Soviet planning economy falling by the wayside in all but a handful of industries (ADB, 2003; Yang, 2004; Pei, 2005). There are intrinsic analytical problems in a zero-sum view of the plan and the market, most crucially in understating the complex duality of the Chinese government's roles as a significant owner of newly privatized firms and as the regulator of industries. Within this duality, Beijing balances between short-term financial gains and market predictability against persistent market distortions and longer- term political and social costs of sustaining oligopolistic firms. In the energy and electricity sectors, the State-owned Assets Super- vision and Administration Commission (SASAC) holds controlling shares in the large petrochemical, power generation and grid companies. Hence key measures such as electricity price liberal- ization affects not only corporate profitability but also the fiscal stability for various levels of the government and the electricity consumers’ sense of economic justice. A regulatory state would presuppose the reconciliation of contending institutional interests within the State Council and ministries, which is unfeasible given the “fragmented authoritarian” structure that governs policy- making process and bureaucratic exchanges in Beijing (Lieberthal and Lampton, 1992). Subnational governments incorporate the regulatory demand from Beijing, while coping with their own complex stakeholder roles in state-owned enterprises.10 From Beijing's vantage point, market creation is largely about facil- itating horizontal integration – i.e. transactions across adminis- trative jurisdictions – through the vehicle of restructured SOEs that consolidate transactions in their extant or newly allocated protected territories.11 The Chinese power sector suffers extraordinary geographical fragmentations of power supply bases, transmissions infrastructure, and markets. The large grid and power generation companies have been charged by political su- periors to manage these intra- and inter-sectoral coordination and collective action problems, but continuing market failures would push national regulators to step up their lawmaking and institu- tion building efforts (Hira et al., 2004; Rodrik, 2004; Hausmann and Rodrik, 2006; Vogel, 1999).
A relative neglect of comparative regulation theories is the institutional risks in creating new regulatory bodies. The in- stitutionalization of new state capacities for interventions is in itself a major disruption to the existing power balance, and once created regulatory agencies raise a new set of risks and co- ordination problems for the political principals and stakeholders (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2008). As subjects of regulation, state- controlled energy corporations have exerted a direct influence on the natures of competition as their dominating market shares, exclusive networks of upstream and downstream integration, and policy privileges virtually guarantee corporate viability and sig- nificant rent from oligopolistic collusion. Therefore, regulatory efforts produce frequent collusions and constant renegotiation of market rules and reform implementation between the industry and government agencies (Andrews-Speed and Dow, 2000).
Industrial restructuring points to a central dilemma of the Chinese party-state's self-preservation. Even as the central bureaucratic elite attempts to build state capacities to implement sustainable market reform, it cannot prevent sub-national state agents – i.e. regulators, local officials, state-appointed managers – from acting strategically for short-run gains at the expense of the overall design. Several of the reform measures we examine in the Chinese power sector would seem half-baked, tentative, or broken up in sequence, not because the re- formers do not know what they were doing but that they deliberately refrained from a coherent and complete sequence of changes that might produce a dangerous backlash that combines fiscal, economic, and social disruptions. Our analysis focuses on the SERC that was created in 2002 as a supra-ministerial agency with a mandate stipu- lating a wide-ranging authority over power generation, transmission and distribution. SERC was the first non-financial, independent reg- ulatory body in the post-command economic administration, and ended on a whimper in 2013 with its functions reassigned to NEA – a unit of the NDRC. A systematic understanding of its political and in- stitutional context of its decade long existence helps us to anticipate the form and effectiveness of the new regulatory models that have also been considered for other sectors and policy areas in China.
3. From breaking up state monopoly to coordinating market oligopoly
Until the 1990s, the development stages of the electricity sector aligned with the broader industrial policy undertakings of the Communist party-state. From 1949–1985, the monopolistic Ministry of Electric Power Industry (MEPI) provided electricity production and service as a vertically integrated monopolized utility and also oversaw all functions of power generation, transmission and distribution.12 The growth of the sector re- mained negative throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and as China's economy took off in the 1980s the state monopoly struggled to meet the country's growing electricity demand (Zhang, 2004). From 1985 onwards and consistent with the general approach to enterprise and fiscal reforms, Beijing pursued decentralized gov- ernance with policies providing sector-specific finance for local governments to invest in electricity generation and planning au- thorities over electricity utilities and markets (Zhang and Heller, 2004; Wirtshafter, 1990).13 Even as the majority of transmission and distribution assets remained in the control of the central government, the proportion of state-owned generating assets was reduced to 46% by the mid 1990s with the remaining 54% staying in the hands of local governments and the independent power producers (Wong and Wong, 1998). With an overall capacity of 236.54GW, a nation-wide generation surplus was achieved by 1996 that ranked China second in terms of the installed electricity generating capacity and output in the world. Starting in the second half of the 1990s and through the first decade of the 2000s, central government struggled to maintain incentives for local capacity expansion while seeking regulatory powers to check the worst excesses of local protectionism, government-business col- lusion, highly inefficient capital usage, and behaviors leading to environmental degradation. From 2007, Chinese planners pro- moted renewable energy and pushed for electricity market reform as essential to achieving China's sustainable development goals, which gained urgency with the global recession and Chinese economic growth slowdown since 2008. SERC played a critical role in cosponsoring many of these reforms with other ministries, but constantly operated with its hands tied against the entrenched corporate and bureaucratic interests. This section assesses the gap between SERC's formal mandate and its operational autonomy and authority.
3.1. Long-term objectives of institutional reform
The institutional reform of China's power sector revolves around four core policy challenges requiring complex coordination between the domestic market, industrial players, and bureaucracies at central and local levels:
1) Electricity supply security in line with China's growing energy demand: Beijing faces chronic problems of managing energy usage cycles and the unequal distribution of power generation areas and consumption centers across China. The dynamics of the alternating shortage and surplus crises are complex are likely amplified by the local political distortions that produce boom-and-bust cycles in capital formation and local state protectionism and market fragmentation (Walton and Finn, 2005; Zhu and Li, 2003).
2) Market creation after the socialist plan: Given the initial ab- sence of functional market signals, central state regulator acts to compensate for deficiencies in the market, in particular with respect to energy prices and access to energy transmission networks. Beijing asks power and grid companies to provide for public goods such as upgrading the power grids, stable prices, energy delivery and service standards across China's vast territories, in return for private goods such as and policy aids on technological upgrading and priority access to banks and stock markets for the capitalization of power companies (Xie, 2009; He, 2003).
3) Coordination of upstream-downstream interests: Industrial analysts often point out conflicts of interests among coal producers, generators, and transmission and distribution companies. These businesses have traditionally come under different lines of administration, and remained weakly medi- ated by market forces and deeply embedded in local socio- economic networks. Until quite recently, planners operated under the premise that direct competition in regional markets was likely to be ineffective, and thus price liberalization would cause unacceptable levels of volatility.14 Instead, the State Council has occasionally intervened to promote long-term supply contracts between coal suppliers and power plants to improve risk management and profitability (Ng, 2008). It has also established guidelines for price increases and cross-re- gional differences that attempt to spread the costs of rising inputs. These interventions keep Beijing at the center of a Catch-22 dilemma of reacting to failures of competition and being blamed for not pushing for liberalization.
4) Future-proofing and strategic policymaking: under the Hu and Xi administrations, Chinese planners have made domestic and inter- national commitments to ecologically sustainable development under lower GDP growth rates. As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, China has rapidly scaled the technological frontiers to become the world's leading investor in renewables and producer of clean-energy products. In the process, industrial policies have become more complex and challenging as the main reform ob- jective of “growing out of the plan” (Naughton, 1995) can no longer be singularly defined as separating out governmental and managerial spheres in SOEs and expanding the scope of market transactions. Successive bureaucratic overhauls and changing policy demands on SOEs reflect these economic strategic com- plexities. We will focus below on the introduction of renewable energy generation and dispatch system reform.
These four challenges have been a distinct feature throughout the evolution of China's electricity sector particularly since the mid- 1980s. Varying stages of policy changes leading up to state-led pri- vatization and liberalization in the 2000s reveal an intricate balancing act the government is forced to play in the creation of more compe- titive market to satisfy the power demand of the growing economy. The independent central regulator emerged in this context as an agency of policy innovation and interest mediation.
3.2. Between a rock and a hard place: SERC's precarious institutional standing
From 1997–2002, the government sought to leverage the mono- poly power of State Power Corporation (SPC) to overcome the local protectionist tendencies of provincial. Under the decentalized ap- proach to power sector development, local governments and the centrally controlled grid companies started to exhibit increasing conflict of interest. The grid companies, despite the agreed “Transmission and Distribution” principle, often raised electricity tariffs for their state-affiliated generating plants all the while com- pressing the ongrid prices and volumes for the provincial plants and other IPPs (Zhang and Heller, 2004). These measures markedly un- dermined the implementation of the “New Plant, New Price” policy as well as the planned unification of transmission and distribution. Provincial protectionism as an emerging phenomenon also began to lay barriers for the opening of transmission and distribution channels to the IPPs from other provinces and regions, for example in blocking the uploading of generated capacity from neighboring provinces.
This horizontal integration approach gave way to further restructuring of SPC by separating the power generating business from the grid transmission (State Council, 2002), creating five generating companies (Huaneng, Datang, Huadian, Guodian, and State Power Investment Company) and two grid companies roughly along geographical lines. The State Grid Company (SGC) is responsible for most of northern China, and the China Southern Grid Company (CSGC) covers the economically thriving southern provinces.
At the national ministerial level, the SERC was established in 2003, endowed with authorities to manage the state monopoly break-up, oversee industry reforms, and promote a competitive market structure of the power sector (State Council, 2002, 2003). Echoing the long-term reform objectives for China's power sector, the 2002 electricity sector reform had multiple goals. It sought to create a fair and competitive power market structure with a wholesale market and independent regulation; to improve effi- ciency and lower costs; to optimize resource allocation and pro- mote development and national grid interconnections; and to continue the rural electricity structural reforms (Zhang and Heller, 2004). To achieve these goals, the SERC was mandated with wide-ranging statutory powers that, in addition to the reg- ulatory function, provided the agency with the authority to sti- pulate and enforce technical standards and propose tariffs and adjustments to government electricity pricing authority, and to investigate market violations (Notice of the Issuance of State Electricity Regulatory Commission’s Function, 2003). The man- dated powers provided the agency with an authoritative statutory platform to oversee the electricity sector. Over the course of its decade long existence, SERC proposed several significance mar- ketization initiatives in price transparency and liberalization, anti-trust measures, experiments in spot markets and information sharing among market players, and expansion of renewable en- ergy sources.
In principle, effective regulation follows, or should be de- termined, by the choice of the electricity structure. China's power sector on the whole deviated from the standard best-practice model where electricity transmission is separated from generation and funded by transmission fees. In other words, China had a wholesale price on electricity that included both generation and transmission. This pricing decision has directly shaped sectoral interests, posing difficulties for marketization and regulation. For the transmission companies, namely the newly established State Grid and China Southern Grid Company, their only means to grow or be cost-effective has been by trading generated electricity of which they take temporary ownership (contrary to the standard ‘unbundled electricity market model’) from the State, regional, or provincially owned power generators, or private IPPs. If China's electricity sector were to follow the standard model, a federal regulator would regulate the transmission side. In this case, it would be the SERC. The shortcomings in the reform sequencing and institutionalization of competitive electricity market struc- tures were indicative of higher-level politicized capture among the China's governing elites. The next section delves into the un- derlying power structures that impede the fulfilment of a fully competitive energy market, and explain the intensification of an underlying struggle between the informal leverages of local gov- ernments and grid and power companies and the new regulatory arms of the central government over the course of reform.
4. Political pitfalls of centralizing electricity market governance
Chen and Naughton, (2017) have described the coevolution of economic and political subsystems in China since 1999 as having gone through two phases – from 1998 to 2012, Beijing put in place a more sustainable set of power arrangements in finance and corporate governance, while continuing to offer local officials incentives and latitude for driving high economic growth. With the economy reaching an unprecedented scale exposing problems of inefficient capital usage, corruption in officialdom, and en- vironmental externalities, Xi Jinping shifted gear to top down initiatives giving central policy-makers “the maximum possible freedom of action” to overcome the system inertia against further structural changes in the economy. The following analysis of intra-ministerial politics, collusive local government and business interests, and the problem of renewable energy curtailment de- monstrates the political resistance against centralized solution to cumulative problems in reforming the power sector.
4.1. Bureaucratic politics within the State Council
To begin with, the precarious institutional standing of the SERC and its inability to flex its wide-ranging formal mandates are best explained by the high level of politicization of energy pol- icymaking within the State Council. The power sector reforms including the institution of the SERC took form during the tenures of Zeng Peiyan (1998–2003) and Ma Kai (2003–2008) as the Chairmen of the NDRC.15 Both individuals were strong propo- nents of the power sector reforms and Ma Kai was a particularly strong proponent of the establishment of the SERC.16 Their ad- vocacy partly produced the decisive changes in the institutional structure in the 2002 reform, but also created the political con- ditions for the subsequent institutional standoffs and the depen- dence on high-level interventions in the form of a supra-minis- terial leadership committee to push toward power reforms and mediate conflicting interests. Since 2010 that elite political im- petus has been formally nested in the National Energy Commis- sion (NEC), operating through a bureau (NEA) in the NDRC. Zhang Ping, the Chairman of the NDRC from 2008 to 2013, was a critic of decentralization of China's power sector and openly espoused a stronger central government involvement in the key substantive and technical areas of energy administration.
Despite the ambitious mandate entrusted upon the SERC, un- certainty regarding the highest-level political support left the agency in a weak political bargaining position. By statute, the SERC should have been an effective regulatory and oversight agency able to design, implement, and enforce effective energy policies, including controlling national, provincial, and regional transmission fees through its regional subsidiaries. Yet SERC ability to conduct regulatory monitoring and enforcement was severely affected by the NDRC's dominant position and powerful levers. Both the Price Bureau and later the NEA within the NDRC exerted such influence on the power sector that they typically left the SERC lost in the wake of their independent actions. The State Price Bureau with provincial branches under the Provincial Development and Reform Commissions (PDRC) is institutionally part of the NDRC and historically approves bundled wholesale and retail prices - a function that has a significant impact on the commercial viability of generating companies in the provinces.
The Pricing Bureaus additionally determine the price of coal, the primary input in electricity generation. NDRC also approves transmission licenses in the provinces and controls the benchmark price for transmission fees across the country.18 In 2003, SERC spearheaded pilots in regional electricity markets. When risk- averse generators and consumers responded negatively to volati- lity in spot market prices, NDRC directed its Price Bureau to in- tervene by suspending price bidding and settling on-grid elec- tricity according to contractual prices, effectively forcing SERC backed off.19
SERC had hoped to improve the regional competitive land- scape in the power sector by proposing anti-trust laws at both provincial and regional levels in order to uproot the anti-compe- titive and collusive business conduct of transmission companies.20 To force the grid companies, namely the State Grid and the Southern Power Grid, and their provincial and regional sub- sidiaries to abide by anti-trust laws, the regulator called for the support of the NDRC – which demurred citing its primary func- tions in price-setting and investment approval mechanisms. No- tably then, as the heads of the state-owned electricity companies were appointed and confirmed at the highest levels of govern- ment, namely the NDRC and the State Council, the exercise of the SERC's authority must be politically circumspect.21 Given this, hopes for constructing provincial and regional electricity market where transmission companies abided by competitive market principles and adhere to regulated national transmission fees (as per unbundled electricity market model) were quickly dashed.
The NDRC's conduct in terms of information sharing also suggested a lack of interest in coming to the aid of the new reg- ulator. The NDRC exclusively controlled all electricity generation and transmission (including distribution) relevant data at pro- vincial and regional levels, which it often refused to share with the SERC, hence leaving the agency with few tools to improve transmission-related pricing problems or to design oversight procedures for regional governance and accountability mechan- isms.22 The NDRC also effectively acted as the final arbiter of whether or not a company can do business in the power sector. Most crucially, NDRC was in charge of the annual generation quota system that determined the output and profitability of most IPPs. NDRC also vetted power purchase agreements (PPA) in contractual negotiations between IPP and the grid companies, empowering it to weld significant influence over entry of private and foreign investment and exchange relations among firms.23 In comparison, SERC's prerogative to issue licenses for market access including safety and standards certifications seemed relatively ineffectual in shaping the competitive dynamics of the electricity sector. Upon its creation in 2008, the NEA took the lead in power sector planning and promotion of new technologies, and later acquired the approval authority over new investments into the sector, further usurping SERC's relevance.24 Generally speaking, throughout SERC's tenure the NDRC had surrendered none of its authority and instead only strengthened its authoritative grip on the power sector.25
Given the weakness of the SERC and the contentious govern- ment-business and central-local relations, Chinese leaders sought to add another layer of strategic governance of energy-related policies and industries. In 2005, the State Council established a National Energy Leading Group to serve as the highest political forum for addressing China's energy security issues, and also to provide a formal, unified governmental interface with the emer- ging corporate interests of the national oil companies.26 In March 2008 the State Council's establishment of the National Energy Administration (NEA) as an agency housed within the supra- ministerial NDRC, and two years later the State Council estab- lished the National Energy Commission (NEC) as a ministerial- level forum cum policy research think tank to take rein of strategic policy-making and coordination.27 While praised NEC as a “super energy institution” – mainly on the basis of its broad mandates and comprehensive range of ministerial stakeholders represented on the commission, rather than any specific capacity and influ- ence as an agency – Zha and Yi (2016) acknowledged that “NEC has functioned on a crisis-driven basis.”28 In 2013 SERC was folded into NEA, which has undertaken the daily work of the NEC. Under the rhetoric of reducing excessive red tape, NEA in effect scaled back regulation by cancelling approval processes and ac- ceptance checks and delegating to local energy regulatory offices the issuance of business permits for power suppliers.29 In any case, NEC and NEA do not amount to a dedicated supra-ministerial body on energy policy, which had been absent since the Ministry of Energy was disbanded in 1993. NEC has been unable to develop bureaucratic leverages independent of the influence of the NDRC - this is perhaps best seen in light of the power sector reforms im- posed by Zhang Ping, the former Chairman of the NDRC, deviating from the ‘independent’ regulator model supported by his pre- decessors.30 Initially led by former SERC head Wu Xinxiong, NEA did not advance ambitious power market reforms.31 To start, NEA has less resource and a lower bureaucratic rank than SERC, and its multitasking – including international energy policy advisory and scientific cooperation – diluted the commitment to domestic regulation and reform implementation. It is likely that leading up to its demise in 2012 the SERC had failed in its lobbying effort to support a supra-ministerial alliance between NEA and the SERC to administer the sector without overbearing oversight by the NDRC.
4.2. Market dominance of power companies
The dismantling of the SPC into five separate power generating companies and the two grid companies formed a two-tier market structure inside China's electricity governance system that strongly favoured the incumbent SOEs. The five state-owned power generating companies formed roughly half of the electricity market in 2009, while the rest was divided among other central government and provincial power generating companies and pri- vate companies.32 As the NDRC controls the electricity generation price, also known as the regional benchmark, the other power generating companies are not in a position to seriously compete with the SOEs which have direct access to the NDRC in its non- transparent price-setting process.33 Furthermore, with their size and national scope of business, the SOEs have superior access to the coal supply whose price they can manipulate and profit from by selling it to other power generating companies.34 Conse- quently, provincial and private power companies face significant disadvantages in their long-term cost of production calculations.
In short, the current electricity market system in China pro- tects the dominant position of the SOEs and prevents the creation of regional or provincial competitive market structures with a separate monopoly transmission company(ies) and distribution monopolies that are ex ante regulated by local regulators ac- cording to national guidelines. For example, in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, the distribution monopolies can be responsible for re- tail sales. When small scale generators are allowed to sell elec- tricity over the local distribution network, the distribution fees, which are analogous to transmission fees, are set by the local regulator. In China however, the distribution arrangements are more complex and problematic. A lack of clear division between transmission and distribution networks across China makes the pricing of distribution, and more generally the way the system works, very difficult to comprehend. In fact, no explicit distribu- tion charges exist, only a regulated retail tariff to final consumers that is controlled by the NDRC.35 The result is that the ill-defined authority lines of control over transmission and distribution net- works seriously obscures the regulatory boundaries between the national, provincial, and regional levels, and inhibits the creation of competitive generation market and retail competition.
Whether the oligopolistic competition has resulted in net effi- ciency gains for electricity market is debatable and empirically in- conclusive, but endemic rent-seeking is evidenced by the increased collusion between regional power market operators and the SOEs.36 This collusion has been particularly striking as regards both electricity and coal pricing. While they do not own or control distribution net- works,theprovincialpowercompaniesdoowninter-regionaltrans- mission systems and generation plants providing them with the re- sources to seek most beneficial power sharing deals with the SOEs. As the SOEs can usually get away with non-compliance with NDRC im- posed regulations, their collusion with regional governments and power companies is predictable.37

Since the demise of SERC, state-owned power and grid com- panies have been able to expand their market dominance and influence over reform proposals and outcomes. Combining their public mandate in achieving energy security with private interests in rent-seeking via dominant market positions, these SOEs have exhibited weak inclination to innovate beyond minimal com- pliance with State Council directives, as an organization with complex embeddedness in political, financial, industrial and uti- lity-end user networks from the socialist legacy, they also show an inertia against relations with new partners including SME sup- pliers and private consumers such as homeowners.38 This con- servative dynamic has spilled over to the renewable energy sector, as Wei Shen (2017) observed the formation of a “policy commu- nity” in renewable energy starting in 2005, in which leading wind turbine and solar panel manufacturers and state-owned electricity utilities have framed the strategic preferences and policy priority in renewable energy by actively offering their expertise and ne- gotiating and coordinating with state actors at both central and local levels. For example, the State Grid's enthusiastic promotion of smart meter and grid and ultra-high voltage transmission pro- jects has been documented as private interests shaping technology choices, leading to criticisms that SGCC's investment exacts op- portunity costs and could be inconsistent with the broader reform design of the planners.39 This “incumbent-led model” of “struc- tural changes in socio-technical regimes” enables these firms to devise corporate strategies at their own pace, limiting the op- portunity for regulators to lead.40
In face of delays in regulatory development and marketization, a major policy thrust in 2017 in the electricity sector was the State Council's endorsement of mega-mergers among the biggest power companies.41 Guodian merged with China's largest miner Shenhua, allowing the former to secure coal supplies while enti- cing the latter to diversify from the fossil fuel business.42 Two former units of the monolithic China Nuclear Industry Corpora- tion, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China Nu- clear Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNEC), com- bined to form an integrated company competing against State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) and China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPC) in building nuclear power plants at home and abroad.43 SPIC is rumoured to be in merger talk with Hua- neng. The mergers conform to SASAC's stated goal to reduce the number of centrally-owned SOEs, and have been justified on the grounds of possible gains for wind power and reduction of coal power overcapacity. It is also possible that bigger central state firms, operating under greater price liberalization of transactions in recent years, could force marketization on smaller players and local governments. The most certain benefit is corporate profit- ability for the SOEs from greater market concentration, reduced price war, higher tariffs, and improved asset profile for stock market valuation and overseas direct investment. However, one should at least consider the political consequences and corporate governance risks of binding together former units of the state monopoly (AsianPower, 2017).
4.3. Resolving the curtailment of renewable energy inputs
The Chinese planners intend wind, solar, and biomass energy to make up 8% of China's power generation capacity by 2020.44 The 2005 Renewable Energy Law provided financial incentives for renewable energy power generators and required grid companies to prioritise renewables in dispatch via mandatory procurement, which spurred rapid local government and private investment in wind and solar capacity building leading to overcapacity out- comes the NEA has not been able to manage.45 Renewable energy curtailment has been estimated to be around 20% on average nationally over the past five years and reaching around 40% in some regions with high renewable energy output (Ho and Nielsen, 2017; Davidson, 2018). In partial response, central planners in- troduced in 2011 a unified national annual plan on wind power development has helped address the problem of fragmented au- thority for project approval. In 2016, a unified five-year plan for the whole power sector was jointly issued by NDRC and NEA, further aiming to put an end to the fragmented planning in various power sources of the previous decade (Qi et al., 2018). Experi- mental schemes were put in place after 2008 to allow some of the power generating companies to sell electricity directly to pro- vincial grid companies and to distribute it to end-users without the involvement of the state-owned grid companies (Ni, 2006; Martinot and Li, 2010). According to the World Bank, a number of such pilot projects exist today and a greater number could even- tually provide the national regulators with the preconditions for wider scope and oversight authority, and hence with the ability to reduce transaction costs in the national electricity market.46 Studies of curtailment have blamed the grid companies for re- jecting renewable inputs during periods of low fossil fuel prices and prioritizing fossil fuels in inter-provincial/regional trans- mission contracts.47 As explained above, the root cause of the companies’ resistance lies in China's institutional design of the electricity market, which has set a pattern of redistribution of economic rents and political relations motivating entrenched in- terest groups to minimize or deflect the impact of new policy di- rections.48 The typical proposed solutions – e.g. raising carbon prices, implementing national cap-and-trade program, creating regional spot market, requiring full purchase of guaranteed RE generation, introducing a green certificate (REC) system, im- posing penalties for unapproved capacity expansion,49 and re- imbursing renewable energy providers and investing in sup- porting transmission infrastructure, etc. – all presuppose that central government takes decisive actions in delineating the structure of its electricity market, or is setting up a system for an functional and transparent ‘unbundled’ electricity provision me- chanism. Given the intrinsic political problems, these reform steps are not feasible given the demise of an independent central reg- ulator (Zhang et al., 2018). As an illustrative example, Davidson (2018, p. 300) notes that the most successful example of cross- jurisdiction exchange has been long-term auctions in parts of North Grid — Beijing, Tianjin, and Northern Hebei – which in- volve government interests closely tied with Beijing, “indicating the likelihood that a strong central government role was necessary to make this regional market happen.”
5. Conclusion: regulatory capacity in flux
As China's transitional electricity sector finds itself under growing pressure to support the country's fast expanding economy, inflexible, inefficient, and even collusive institutional structures continue to hamper the designed power sector reforms (Du et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Pollitt et al., 2017). Power struggle between the political elites, inability to reign in and adequately control regional and local power markets, collusive behavior even between regional administrative agencies in regard to transmission and distribution of electricity, and the controlling position of the NDRC all constitute enormous challenges to the power sector reformers. The case study of SERC helps to explain why China's power sector governing institutions have seen little stability over the past two decades and policy norms – which play a significant role in the creation or reform of regulatory mod- alities in other transitional contexts – have yet to take root in China.
This institutional weakness corresponds to reform impasse in the past five years. Beijing initiated its latest round of electricity reform in 2015 with the State Council Document 9: “Furthering Reform of the Electricity Market.”50 Given difficulties with state- owned enterprise reform in general and other economic priorities in under President Xi Jinping's first four years, no breakthrough measures have been implemented.51 The main objectives in this round of reform include trying out the principle of “cost plus reasonable profit” in transmission and distribution tariff, liberal- ization of the retail electricity market to attract diverse investors and to establish a relatively independent electricity trade center, and improving the generation dispatch mechanisms (Kahrl et al., 2016). Pilot programmes testing these reforms have been in place in select provinces, but have yet to reach widespread national implementation. This piecemeal approach, typical in the “ex- perimental” approach (Heilmann, 2008) to structural reform in China, creates pockets of resistance to policy mandates and variability in policy outcomes such as growing disparities in price signals between provinces that run market pilots and those that do not (Kahrl et al., 2016; Pollitt et al., 2017). Nevertheless, there has been an encouraging rise in the amount of electricity sold through so-called direct trading – i.e. market-based mechanisms such as direct sales and centralized auctions – which reached 19% of total electricity consumption in 2016 and was expected to top 35% in 2017 (Wang, 2017). Until 2015, power producers had to sell electricity at prices set by the grid companies, resulting in higher prices that in recently years had not reflected the supply glut. Chinese industry users pay some 50% higher electricity cost than US industries. Recent establishment of some 28 electricity trading centers across China have allowed power-generating firms to negotiate supply contracts directly with end users such as large industrial companies or distributors, resulting in significant price drops. The major short-run loser is the State Grid, which an- nounced that it lost 56 billion RMB in earnings in the first half of 2017.52
One might have expected the politics of power sector reform to have reached a turning point at the massive bureaucratic streamlining effort in March 2018, underpinned by President Xi Jinping's governance approach of centralized solutions to struc- tural problems in the troubled Chinese economy.53 Surprisingly, the energy and power sectors did not get a new national reg- ulator.54 Pending further information on the elite policy process, one could interpret the shelving of a new energy ministry either positively or critically. Instead of re-creating another agency that cannot overcome overlapping ministerial jurisdictions and dis- entangle from powerful SOEs and clientelistic politics, Chinese President Xi Jinping has allocated his political capital to first re- shape the organizational field of the State Council, notably in reducing the role of NDRC. NDRC's oversight function of China's carbon emissions is reassigned to the new Ministry of Ecological Environment, and its price supervision, inspection and anti- monopoly roles will be merged into a powerful State Adminis- tration for Market Regulation.55 One begins to detect a rationa- lizing logic in Xi's approach to ministerial restructuring, prior- itizing effective performance of general tasks over sector-specific administration that has been vulnerable to capture.56 In contrast, a critical interpretation would question whether the March 2018 bureaucratic reshuffling paves the way for deep market reforms, or is yet another means of Xi's continuing consolidation of power by putting his supporters in power and asserting party control over state administration.57
In concluding we recall Andrews-Speed and Dow (2000) who astutely observed a decade ago that while the Chinese central government has lost or relinquished its vertical command and control, it has yet to take on new responsibilities in supervising or regulating horizontal, contractual relationships. Eighteen years later, Zhang et al. (2018) maintain that there remains an urgent need for a strong central government role in top-level design and supervision, market creation, and promotion of renewable energy. It seems a matter of time before Beijing will support the re-es- tablishment of a central regulatory body that could go beyond SERC's limitations."
43,Understanding institutional barriers for wind curtailment in China,"The recent recurrence of wind curtailment in China underscores the rigidity and vulnerability of China's electricity regulatory regime. Using the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism”, this paper identifies key institutional barriers causing wind curtailment in China and develops a framework for analyzing China's electricity regulatory regime. Specifically, the fragmented institutional authorities and responsibilities lead to departmentalism and coordination problems, both vertically and horizontally. The resulting mismatches in the investment, generation, and distribution of the electric power sector reflect direct causes for China's wind curtailment. This paper recommends that an electric power system reform with established regional spot markets is needed to fix China's wind curtailment problem.","1. Introduction
China is a leading power in renewable energy investment. In 2010, China surpassed the U.S. to lead the world in wind power installation. In 2016, China's newly installed wind power capacity accounted for 37.7% of the global market share, while its cumulative installations constituted 31.9% of the global market [1]. Within China, wind power accounted for 9% of its total power capacity and 4% of total electricity generation in 2016.
Despite China's leadership in installed wind power capacity, its wind energy electricity output is lower than that of the U.S. [2,3]. Among the causes of lower wind power generation, wind curtailment has risen as the most prominent. Wind curtailment is the abandonment of electricity generation from effective wind power capacity or the prevention of well-functioning wind turbines from producing power. In China, the issue of wind curtailment has haunted its wind energy de- velopment since 2010.
Wind curtailment results in significant economic and energy efficiency losses. In 2016, 49.7 TWh of wind power was curtailed in China [4]. This is enough to cover the total electricity consumption of Bangladesh, a po- pulation of 163 million. In the same year, China on average curtailed 17.1% of its wind power generation. The lost sales for power producers amounted to 18.7 billion RMB (or $2.7 billion). If the abandoned wind electricity were fully utilized to substitute coal, China could have reduced 42 million tons of CO2 emission, close to the total emission of Bulgaria.
International experiences indicate that a normal wind curtailment rate typically ranged between 1% and 3% of the potential wind power generation [5]. However, in many years, the wind curtailment rate in China exceeded 10%; Provinces like Gansu, Xinjiang, and Jilin reached curtailment rates of 43%, 38%, and 30% respectively in 2016 [4]. By contrast, Italy and Texas in the United States had lower wind curtail- ment rates of 10.7% and 17.1% in 2009, before rectifying drops to less than 2% within the next three to four years. These drops were due to transmission network expansion [5,6]. China's wind curtailment, however, has remained high for more than seven years and even wor- sened in 2015 and 2016. This indicates that the causes behind China's wind curtailment is potentially complex.
Many factors have been identified as causes for wind curtailments in China. These include: (1) technical limitations of electricity grid [7,8]; (2) power system inflexibility and peak regulation problems [2,9–16]; (3) transmission constraints [10–12,17]; (4) limited local electricity demand coupled with mismatch between transmission capacity and wind capacity development [11,17,18]; and (5) insufficient planning coordination, grid management policies and other institutional reasons [18–22]. Recently, Dong et al. [23] employed an index decomposition method to evaluate the contributions of five factors to wind curtail- ment; nevertheless, no institutional factors were included.
The various factors above did not fully address the complexity of China's wind curtailment issues. While individual factors were studied, little research has been done on the interaction among different factors.
It is likely that many factors may share the same underlying and in- stitutional causes. Some research tried to connect wind curtailment with political economy interests [21,22]; however, it is difficult to understand these interests in-depth without explicitly examining the institutional arrangement in the power sector of China.
This paper builds upon the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism” and develops an electricity regulatory framework (ERF) to explain China's wind curtailment problem. This electricity regulatory framework consists of key players and their roles in the electric power sector and is used to tease out the underlying institutional causes for wind curtailment. These institutional causes in turn determine various direct (or high-level) reasons for wind curtailment. The paper subsequently demonstrates the electricity regulatory framework using two case studies: Jiuquan in the Gansu pro- vince and Tongyu in the Jilin province. These two cases are typical ex- amples of the wind curtailment problem in China and have sufficient details to help understand the complexity of the issue as well as the electricity regulatory framework. The ERF on wind curtailment has strong implications on similar curtailments of solar, hydro and nuclear power.
The remainder of the paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 introduces the wind curtailment issue within the wind energy devel- opment context in China. Section 3 presents the electricity regulatory framework to describe the institutional causes behind the general wind curtailment problem and the essence of the issue. Section 4 is an ana- lysis of the two case studies of Jiuquan and Tongyu, with necessary supporting evidence. Section 5 are conclusions and policy re- commendations.
2. Wind energy development and wind curtailment problem
2.1. Resource-based strategy for wind energy development
Although China has favorable natural conditions for wind power gen- eration, the geographical distribution of wind energy resources is highly uneven (Fig. 1). Most of China's wind energy resource is concentrated in seven provinces in the Three North region—northwest (Xinjiang and Gansu), northeast (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning), and north (Hebei, Inner Mongolia). However, these wind-rich provinces are economically
underdeveloped and have relatively low local electricity demand. Thus, they often need to export their wind power to other regions. While the best wind resource is located in the West and North, the electricity load centers are often thousands of miles away in the East and South.
Given these conditions, China adopted a resource-based wind power development strategy. This meant focusing on wind capacity develop- ment in resource-rich provinces and depending on long-distance elec- tricity transmission and trans-provincial dispatch to integrate wind. In 2012, the Chinese government decided to establish big-scale wind power bases to further promote wind energy development. Among the nine proposed 10-GW scale wind power bases in the 12th Five-Year Wind Power Development Plan,1 seven of them are located in the Three North region with limited local electricity demand. In 2016, the accu- mulated wind power capacity in the Three North region accounted for 71.5% of total in China. China's big resource-based wind power bases has imposed great challenge on its wind power integration.
2.2. Wind curtailment problem: two waves and Three North provinces
Wind curtailment appears to be a recurring problem in China. As shown in Fig. 2, there has been two waves of high wind curtailment since 2010. The first wave occurred from 2010 to 2012, when the national average wind curtailment rate increased from 10% to 17%. However, the problem was significantly mitigated in 2013 and 2014, with govern- mental efforts to expand the transmission infrastructure. The relative low wind resource in 2014 also contributed to the mitigation of wind cur- tailment problem [25]. However, with economic deceleration and the resultant low electricity demand growth, wind curtailment rate bounced back in 2015 [23]. These variations in the wind curtailment rate suggest a dynamic feature for reasons behind this enduring problem.
Provinces in the Three North regions were most seriously affected by wind curtailment. In 2016, wind curtailment from these provinces accounted for 99% of the national total, much higher than their wind capacity share (72%). Furthermore, the severity of wind curtailment differed across provinces. As shown in Table 1, for Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang province, both the wind curtailment rates and wind capacity shares were above 20%. Similar situations occurred in Jilin and Heilongjiang. The shares of wind power generation in these provinces were also high. By contrast, Hebei and Ningxia had a wind capacity share at around 20%; however, the wind curtailment rates in these two provinces were only about 10%. Ningxia also had the third highest wind generation share. Lastly, both Shanxi and Shaanxi had relatively low wind curtailment rates and wind capacity shares, and the proportion of wind generation in Shaanxi was also the lowest. These regional variations suggest that multiple reasons exist behind the wind curtailment problem and the solutions need to be customized for dif- ferent provinces.
Since 2016, the Chinese central government has promulgated a series of policies to tackle the wind curtailment problem, such as guaranteed minimum purchase hours for wind power and a trial quota on renewable development and utilization. However, these policies could easily run into institutional barriers. For instance, despite the central government's requirements on the minimum purchase/utiliza- tion hours for wind farms, six out of the nine provinces did not meet the requirements in 2016. This points to deep institutional causes behind the wind curtailment issue.
3. Wind curtailment in electricity regulatory framework
Wind curtailment has occurred within the backdrop of China's heavily regulated electricity system. The electric power sector is a ty- pical natural monopoly with rigid hierarchy, and dominated by state- owned enterprises (SOEs). Investments, electricity production, and al- location in the power sector are under major control by the government, mostly at the provincial level. Although China has in- itiated two rounds of power sector marketization reform in 2002 and 2015, the role of price signal is still rather limited and government control on the electricity system remains strong.
This paper builds upon the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism” by Lieberthal and Oksenberg [31], and analyzes China's wind curtailment problem with an electricity regulatory framework. This paper argues that in addition to technical challenges, the current wind curtailment problem is a result of fragmented authority governing China's electric power sector. Fig. 3 summarizes the paper's conceptual framework, which comprises key players and their roles in the investment, generation and allocation pro- cesses of the power sector. These two are similar to the structural factor and operational factor in Zhao et al. [32]. While the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism” highlights a key role of bargaining among key players, this paper argues that the fragmented authority in the electricity sector mainly leads to various coordination problems.2
3.1. Key players and their roles 3.1.1. Central government
In the power sector, China's central government plays a steering role. First of all, the central government approves national goals for capacity development regarding both generation and transmission, plans inter-regional electricity exchange, and determines general elec- tricity system dispatch rules and on-grid tariff level. For the ongoing marketization reform, the central government formulates general reg- ulations and policies, designs market trading rules and trading pro- ducts, and supervises the market. All these functions of the central government are scattered across several central ministries. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), for example, co- ordinates with more than nine other ministries in drafting of market- ization reform policies of the power sector.
Regarding wind power development, scattered functions and di- vided management exist at the central government level. As Fig. 4 shows, the National Energy Administration (NEA) sets up the devel- opment goals for both power generation and transmission and subse- quently chooses the strategies to achieve them.3 The Department of Price (DOP) of NDRC determines the incentive levels to develop wind capacity, mainly through adjusting the level of feed-in tariffs. The Bu- reau of Economic Operations Adjustment (BEOA) directs and approves provincial annual power generation and allocation plans and initiates plans for cross-province power exchanges. The State-owned Assets Su- pervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) supervises the assets of energy SOEs (i.e. both grid companies and generation companies) while the Ministry of Finance (MOF) disburses the subsidies of feed-in tariffs for wind electricity generation.
Management is even fragmented within one ministry, leading to the lack of coordination amongst different bureaus. Until very recently, separated plans on thermal power, hydro power, wind power, nuclear power, solar energy, and biomass energy were issued by different de- partments of NEA. All these generation sources have displayed a stag- gering growth trend to meet the energy demand in China. An integrated planning of all power generation sources did not exist during the whole 11th and 12th FYP periods (2006–2015). Furthermore, there had been no national grid plan issued during these years, and grid projects were approved one by one by NEA (Interview BJ20160531). The coordina- tion between power sources and grid infrastructure was thus missing.
3.1.2. Local government
The local government plays a dominant role in China's regulatory framework, especially in intra-province power generation and alloca- tion. Province governments decide the provincial development goals (including power investments), make annual power generation and allocation plans, and approve power projects within their adminis- trative jurisdictions. As for inter-provincial power transfers, the re- levant provincial governments can negotiate the issue with the help of corresponding provincial grid companies. The provincial government also dominates local electricity marketization design and supervises the market under the general guidelines set by the central government.
It is important to differentiate between provincial governments and municipal governments, for the latter bear much of the function of local economic development. In the wind-rich Three North region, wind turbine manufacturing is one of municipal governments’ favorite in- dustries to develop, since it can bring in capital investments, tax rev- enues, and employments. Most municipal governments have used a strategy of “exchanging wind resources for manufacturing industry”: at the wind project bidding stage, municipal governments usually require big energy enterprises to set up local manufacturing factories in exchange for wind development priority [33]. While municipal gov- ernments are devoted to wind power development and manufacturing, they tend to neglect effective wind power grid integration."
43,Understanding institutional barriers for wind curtailment in China,"The recent recurrence of wind curtailment in China underscores the rigidity and vulnerability of China's electricity regulatory regime. Using the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism”, this paper identifies key institutional barriers causing wind curtailment in China and develops a framework for analyzing China's electricity regulatory regime. Specifically, the fragmented institutional authorities and responsibilities lead to departmentalism and coordination problems, both vertically and horizontally. The resulting mismatches in the investment, generation, and distribution of the electric power sector reflect direct causes for China's wind curtailment. This paper recommends that an electric power system reform with established regional spot markets is needed to fix China's wind curtailment problem.","3.1.3. Grid companies (GridCOs)
Grid companies are responsible for power dispatch, transmission, distribution, and electricity sales in China. There are two large state- owned regional grid companies – State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid Corporation. As subsidiaries of these two com- panies, there are five regional grid companies, 37 provincial grid companies, and 431 municipal grid companies. Splitting the functions of grid companies is considered one of the most important goals of the ongoing electricity marketization reform.
A GridCO operates the electricity system within its designated area (mostly within one province) and dispatches generations according to prescribed policies and technical principles. Guiding policies could come from both the central government and local government, which may sometimes contradict each other. In those cases, grid companies tend to lean towards local government guidelines (Interview LZ20160808). In terms of technical principles, the 2005 Renewable Energy Law stipulated that integrating wind energy shall not pose an adverse impact on the grid system reliability. Such a requirement left substantial discretions in the hands of GridCOs to define grid reliability.
According to the institutional assignment of electricity market- ization policy in 2002, grid companies should assist in national grid planning.4 In fact, from 2006 to 2015, the two large GridCOs made their own five-year grid plans separately, while NEA did not issue any unified national grid plan. In 2011, State Grid Corporation planned for several 19 ultra-high voltage (UHV) long-distance transmission projects in its five-year regional grid plan and submitted the plan to NEA and NDRC. However, these projects were only slowly approved by NDRC case by case due to safety considerations [34,35]. The lack of coordination between generation and transmission is often blamed as a key factor that causes delay of wind power connection and transmission.
3.1.4. Generation companies (GenCOs) and big electricity consumers
Generation Companies in China are mostly big state-owned en- terprises. After the 2002 electricity market reform, these SOEs were called “Big Five and Small Four” GenCOs. They often competed against each other in each province. The wind energy development was sup- posed to follow a renewable energy quota, which was first proposed in the Medium and Long Term Renewable Energy Development Plan back in 2007. However, such a quota mechanism was not formally im- plemented. Yet, competition in enclosing the best wind resources has long been the rule of the game.
The investment activities of GenCOs are based on many factors other than profit. Since most performance-evaluation indicators for state-owned GenCOs are related to the size of asset, these companies typically respond with expansion in their sizes. Sometimes, investment activities of GenCOs may seem irrational when judged based profit- ability. At the county level, GenCOs try hard to acquire land with good wind resources. At the provincial level, GenCOs compete fiercely for annual wind development quota. For example, more than 300 GenCOs (including small local ones) were waiting in the pipeline to get a quota from the third development batch of Zhangjiakou Wind Power Base in 2016 (Interview BJ20160628).
Big electricity consumers, such as chemical manufacturers, have unique roles to play. They are not directly involved in the energy policy-making process at the central level. But, as big local enterprises, they are key to local economy and are thus very important players in local policy-making. For example, to maintain economic growth and to protect big manufacturers, provincial governments have established electricity transaction centers and encouraged big customers to directly purchase electricity from power gen- erators instead of the grid company since 2013. Consequently, big custo- mers in local area could get lower electricity price to survive through un- favorable economy conditions (Interview LZ20160806).
In short, fragmentation in electric power regulation exists at both the vertical and horizontal levels. At the vertical level, regulatory au- thority is distributed amongst the central government and 32 local governments. While the central government makes national policies, individual local governments decide power generation and allocation plans inside their jurisdictions. At the horizontal level, regulation re- sponsibilities are scattered among different ministries or departments of both the central and local governments. Decision-making authority is even fragmented within one ministry or department. Horizontally, state-owned grid companies, generation companies, and even big electricity consumers have strong bargaining power. The scattered functions and fragmented delegation of power and responsibilities at both the central and local governments lead to departmentalism and difficulty of coordination. In wind power investment and distribution, such lack of coordination results in transmission constraints, system imbalance, as well as overcapacity. These problems directly lead to the wind curtailment problem.
3.2. The operation of electricity regulatory framework
In this section, we outline how the fragmentation of authority be- tween different actors plays out in investment and distribution pro- cesses of wind power, and how it results in wind curtailment.
3.2.1. Investment in power sector
The central government and provincial governments guide wind project investments through wind power planning and control the size of investments through project approvals. From 2006–2015, power capa- city plans had been formulated by governments at all levels and grid plans were separately formulated by grid companies. For project ap- proval, the central government might, at times, delegate the approval authority to provincial governments for smaller projects (e.g. wind farms less than 50 MW). In 2013, the right to approving wind projects was delegated to local governments completely. Thus, the central govern- ment only planed for the national wind energy development goals.
This scattered functions and divided management inside the central and local government from 2006 to 2015 created three mismatch problems: 1) mismatch between national planning and provincial planning; 2) mismatch between generation planning and grid planning, and 3) mismatch between renewable power units and other power sources. For example, while the national wind power capacity targets for 2010 and 2015 were 10 GW and 100 GW, the installed capacity numbers by provinces were 31 GW and 129 GW respectively. Both ex- ceeded the original targets by 30%.
Once power projects are approved, they will be developed mostly by big state-owned generation companies. Due to strong governmental endorsement, big state-owned generation companies can easily borrow money from state-owned banks, and bank loans normally account for 80% of total investment of big SOEs [33]. This creates a classic soft budget constraint problem [36].
3.2.2. Electric power generation and allocation
Provincial governments administer the production of power units inside their jurisdictions through the Annual Power Generation Plan, which determines the annual generation or utilization hours for dif- ferent power units. Provincial grid companies are responsible for car- rying out the plan by disaggregating it into monthly and daily dispatch plans. Meanwhile, provincial governments manage electricity con- sumption through the Annual Power Allocation Plan within their jur- isdictions. The plan sets the priority of electricity utilization for dif- ferent consumers at different tariffs. In most provinces, these two plans are drafted by grid companies, before being adjusted, approved and released by provincial governments (Interview LZ20160806).
The current provincial Power Generation Plan restrains power gen- eration unit dispatch within a province, while regional dispatch is utterly inadequate. Once electricity supply surplus happens in a province, cur- tailment becomes inevitable without increasing power exports. The in- termittent wind power is usually the first to be curtailed. Furthermore, decelerated economic growth tends to exaggerate the inter-provincial barriers, since local governments would protect local power generators for tax revenue and employment purposes. The power importing pro- vinces become unwilling to import electricity from other provinces when their demand can be met with local supplies (Interview LZ20160806).
For inter-provincial and inter-regional transactions, there has been three kinds of institutional arrangements: planned distribution by NDRC, provincial government negotiations, and market transaction. NDRC used to issue the Annual Inter-regional and Inter-provincial Power Transaction Plan, which was drafted by the two largest regional grid companies and subsequently approved by NDRC. Nevertheless, with the ongoing elec- tricity market reform, NDRC ceased such planning in 2017. Provincial government negotiations also play a big role regarding inter-provincial electricity transactions. Meanwhile, Guangzhou and Beijing Electricity Power Exchange Centers began to organize inter-provincial trade. However, the transactions of wind power were still insignificant. Currently, inter-provincial power transactions depend majorly on the provincial governments’ bargaining power.
To summarize, the electricity regulatory regime in China shows four distinctive features: (1) fragmented authority at both central and local government levels; (2) provincial control of planning for electric power generation and allocation; (3) strong inter-provincial barriers; and (4) weak market mechanism. Such a regime can be very effective for rapid renewable power development, but ineffective to deal with inter-pro- vincial transmission and national system optimization. Next, this paper uses two cases studies to demonstrate such ineffectiveness.
4. Case studies: Jiuquan and Tongyu
4.1. The case of Jiuquan, Gansu Province
Jiuquan in Gansu Province is abundant with wind resources. Wind power density is greater than 150W/m2 in most areas [37].
Furthermore, the cost for wind energy development in Jiuquan is lower than other places because the cost of desert land acquisition is low. Wind power developers consider Jiuquan as the best region in China for large-scale wind power development (Interview LZ20160807). How- ever, a key disadvantage is its long distance from load centers in the East and South of China.
4.1.1. Wind power development in Jiuquan
In 2005, the Jiuquan municipal government initiated a wind power development strategy and submitted its plan to build a one-GW Wind Power Base to the Development and Reform Commission of Gansu Province and the NDRC. However, the NDRC did not approve this plan. In 2006, the new Renewable Energy Law of China evoked enthusiasm among wind developers as well as local governments. In 2007, Jiuquan's plan won support from the provincial leader and one vice Premier. Then, in early 2008, Jiuquan received approval to build the first 10-GW wind power base in China.
The construction of Jiuquan Wind Power Base was divided into two phases (Table 2). The first phase was planned for 3.8GW and the construction took place from 2009 to 2012. According to the municipal government's planning, the construction of phase I would be finished by 2010, which is the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) period. This was a very tight schedule considering the scale of installation and construction interruptions in frigid winter seasons. However, the mu- nicipal government realized that they could compete for a larger share in the national wind energy development plan for the following 12th FYP if Phase I (the 11th FYP) were to finish by 2010. Therefore, from 2009 to 2010, the local government accelerated the wind farm con- struction, even during the winter [38].
In 2010, investment in wind power projects and related manu- facturing industries in Jiuquan reached 22.3 billion RMB ($3.3 billion), while tax revenue reached 194 million RMB ($28.7 million). More than 8000 jobs were created. Driven by wind power development, Jiuquan's GDP rose from the fourth in 2005 to the second in 2010 amongst all prefectures in Gansu [39].
Wind curtailment in Jiuquan appeared as early as in 2009 [40]. In 2008, the wind power delivery capacity of the local grid was less than 500 MW, utterly inadequate for future electricity exports. Two addi- tional 750 kV transmission lines were planned to transmit Jiuquan's wind power into the Northwest grid. The first transmission project in- creased the delivery capacity to 2.6GW, enough to meet the trans- mission needs of the planned power capacity (3.8 GW). However, the Gansu provincial government approved 35 other power generation projects with a total capacity of about 1.3 GW. Combined with another 0.4 GW concession bidding project, the total installed wind power ca- pacity in the first phase reached to 5.5 (= 3.8 + 1.3 + 0.4) GW, far beyond the original target (3.8 GW). As a result, the wind curtailment rate reached to 30–40% in 2010 [Interview JQ20160811]. Even after the completion of the first transmission line, wind curtailment re- mained above 20% after a temporary relief in 2011 (Table 3).
In 2011, the Jiuquan government began to push on the construction of wind farms for the second phase. After one year of negotiation with NEA, the projects of the second phase in Jiuquan were divided into two batches: the first batch was 3 GW and the second batch was 5 GW. In September 2012, NEA approved the construction of the first batch, and the second batch would be approved only if the transmission problem was solved. In 2013, another 750 kV transmission project was put into commercial operation, increasing the output capacity to 5.68GW. However, the total wind power capacity in Jiuquan reached 6 GW, and solar photovoltaic (PV) installations reached 0.96 GW. Moreover, other cities’ wind and solar installations in the same region also shared the same transmission lines with Jiuquan, limiting the space for the latter.
When the construction of the first batch was finished in 2015, ser- ious wind curtailment occurred. As a response, NEA halted wind project approvals and constructions in Gansu, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other provinces in March 2016. Although preliminary work of the second batch already began, the construction of wind farms was post- poned due to the wind curtailment problem.
Concerned parties rested their hopes on another 800 kV UHV cross- region transmission line from Jiuquan to Zhuzhou in Hunan. Back in 2010, a UHV cross-region transmission line was first proposed by Gansu and the State Grid Corporation. Later in 2011, provincial governments from Gansu and Hunan signed an agreement on electricity transmission with support from the State Grid Corporation. Unfortunately, NDRC did not approve the project until 2015 due to a disagreement on the exact UHV technology to use [41]. Finally, the transmission line started construction in 2015 and was put into operation in 2017.
A new problem emerged in 2017 that the recipient provinces in the Central China region were no longer in short of power supply. In Hunan province, generation companies had installed 12 GW power generation capacity from 2011 to 2016. The same situation also happened in other provinces of the region. Latest news suggested that the electricity ex- port through the UHV line was far below Gansu's expectation. Thus, the wind curtailment rate in Gansu in 2017 remained as high as 33% [30].
4.1.2. Wind curtailment in Gansu province
The wind curtailment issue in Jiuquan needs to be understood within the context of Gansu Province and the Northwest region. First, the power generation and distribution plan of Jiuquan wind power base was part of the provincial plan. Second, before September 2014, power generation from Jiuquan was distributed and balanced in the northwest electricity grid managed by the regional grid company.
Regarding direct reasons that explain Gansu's wind curtailment, we identify three of them from 2009 to 2014: transmission constraint, system balance, and overcapacity. From 2015 onwards, the problem mainly comes from the demand side. Since we have already discussed the transmission constraint above, hereafter we only focus on the other three reasons.
4.1.2.1. System balance. Before September 2014, the regional grid company—Northwest Grid—was responsible for balancing wind power generation output in the five northwestern provinces. In order to overcome wind power's intermittency, hydro power from Qinghai province was often used for system balance. However, after September 2014, the authority for wind power operation was transferred from regional grid company to the provincial grid company. This immediately worsened the system balance situation in Gansu province (Interview LZ20160808). The limited pool of system balancing resources in Gansu led to increasing wind curtailment rates.
Other than the above policy change, the needed coordination be- tween wind capacity addition and system balance was missing in the planning stage. In the Jiuquan Wind Power Base plan, the system bal- ance issue was not even mentioned. Furthermore, there was a lack of coordination on wind power capacity growth and system balance in the 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) for Energy Development in Gansu Province. Both of these reflect the separation and fragmentation of regulation authority institutionally.
4.1.2.2. Oversupply. In 2009, when Gansu proposed becoming a national energy base and providing energy to other provinces, four out of five provinces in the same Northwest region (e.g. Ordos in Inner Mongolio and Xinjiang) almost concurrently positioned themselves as national energy bases in the 12th Five Year Plan. Without sufficient trans-regional projects, oversupply in power sector was inevitable.
From 2014 onwards, due to insufficient demand, excessive power supply became a key factor for wind curtailment in Gansu Province. In the end of 2016, the total installed electricity generation capacity was 48GW in total, 28GW of which were hydro, wind and PV power. Meanwhile, in July 2016, the maximum load of Gansu grid dropped to about 12 GW from 13.8 GW in 2014. The minimum load was less than 11 GW and the total installed power capacity was about four times of the maximum load. Furthermore, the power supply in Gansu was in severe overcapacity [43]. As shown in Fig. 5, though the electricity generation from thermal and hydro power units decreased in recent years, their installed capacity was still increasing. At the same time, wind and solar power experienced steady increases in terms of both capacity and generation. The oversupply trend has not been reversed in Gansu.
4.1.2.3. Demand side. Demand for electricity has been slowing down or even decreasing in both Gansu and its exporting counterparts. The growth of electricity consumption in Gansu province decelerated significantly in the latter half of the 12th FYP period and the growth rate even dropped to −3.1% in 2016 (Fig. 6). Besides, the electricity demand of the Northwest Grid region has also been decreasing. In the first quarter of 2016, the maximum power load decreased by 2.0% compared to that of the first half of 2015. Besides, all five provinces in the region have been dogged by the wind power curtailment problem [45,46].
The importing provinces also suffered a significant slowdown of electricity demand. As shown in Fig. 6, electricity export from Gansu dropped and stabilized after 2011, before further dropping in 2015. With much effort by the Provincial government, including exporting to Tibet and Qinghai [47], the amount of electricity export increased by 15.2% in 2016.
4.2. The case of Tongyu, Jilin Province
Jilin Province is rich in wind resources. Of its 200 GW of wind en- ergy potential, 54 GW could be developed for power generation. In response to the NEA initiative to accelerate wind power development in 2007, Jilin planned to develop five one-GW wind power bases as well as other wind projects. The plan called for centering wind power gen- eration in Tongyu county.
4.2.1. Wind power development in Tongyu
In 1999, the first wind farm in Jilin Province was built in Tongyu County. In 2004, NDRC held a second round of public bidding for wind power projects, including two big projects from Tongyu, with a total capacity of 400 MW. From 2005 onwards, more and more power gen- eration enterprises came to Tongyu and these enterprises built 19 wind resource measuring towers. In 2006, Tonyu municipal government announced its plan to make Tongyu a National Green Energy Demonstration County and the largest wind power base in China. By the end of 2007, the installed wind power capacity in Tongyu county amounted to 217 MW.
In March 2009, the province government announced the building of a 2.3 GW wind power base in Tongyu county. In the same year, the municipal government submitted the application of a transmission project to NDRC for approval. Normally, transmission lines and sub- stations were invested by the state-owned grid company. In the case of Tongyu, however, the municipal government wanted to expedite the construction and evade complex procedures with the grid company. Thus, it coordinated nine wind developers to invest 402 million RMB ($58.8 million) and constructed a 500 kV step-up substation and a 201- kilometer transmission line. This project was soon completed in 2010 [48,49].
The application of the official transmission project was only ap- proved by NDRC three years later in 2012. Furthermore, since the transmission line passed through one county in Inner Mongolia and several other counties in Jilin, the Tongyu municipal government had to gain permissions from all of these counties. Meanwhile, the Jilin provincial government and the central government needed to work with Inner Mongolia for inter-provincial transmission. After 15 months of coordination, the transmission line began construction in 2013 and was finally put into operation at the end of 2015 [48–50].
The municipal government also worked hard to make Tongyu a wind turbine manufacturing center. In 2004, Tongyu municipal gov- ernment brought in the first wind equipment manufacturer with an investment of 40 million RMB ($4.8 million). In 2008, the municipal government attracted another manufacturer with 600 million RMB ($86.4 million) worth of investment. This program was expected to bring tax revenues worth of 265 million RMB ($38.2 million), which was 13 times the size of the county's tax revenue in 2008. In 2009, the Tonyu municipal government, Jilin Province Investment Group, and Sany Group (a heavy machine manufacturer) jointly invested in the Sany Wind Power Industry Park. The planned total investment for the park was 10 billion RMB ($1.5 billion) in five years, and expected products included wind turbines, blades, and tower tubes [49].
The wind power installation in Tongyu county stagnated from 2009 to 2014, because of the lengthy application and negotiation process on the transmission line. As a result, the Sany Wind Power Industry Park was deserted during this period. The NEA suspended new construction of wind power projects in Jilin due to serious wind curtailment in the province until 2015, the expected time of when the new transmission line would be put into operation. In 2015, the local government began a new round of negotiation with NEA and NDRC, and persuaded wind power developers to start their project construction and investment early.
4.2.2. Factors driving wind power curtailment in Jilin province
Similar to Jiuquan in Gansu, the wind curtailment issue in Tongyu needs to be understood in the context of Jilin Province and the Northeast region. As early as in 2011, the wind curtailment rate in Jilin was 15%. From 2012 onwards, Jilin was among the top three provinces nationally. In 2015, its wind curtailment rate rose back to 32% (Table 4). Within Jilin, the most serious wind curtailment occurred in Tongyu, where the average curtailment rate was above 25%.
Before 2012, the main reasons for wind curtailment in Jilin province were transmission constraint, system balance, and oversupply. Starting in 2012, electricity demand growth in the province began to slow down and the growth rate first dropped to 1.1% in 2012. In 2015, the elec- tricity demand even decreased by 2.4%.
4.2.2.1. Transmission constraint. Wind power development has been haunted by transmission constraint in Jilin province. For the 2.3 GW wind power base in Tongyu county, grid connection and wind electricity transmission were not mentioned in the provincial grid plan. Furthermore, new transmission line construction in Northeastern provinces (Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning) generally lagged behind other top wind curtailment provinces (Table 5). Only till 2015, the 201km transmission line project to feed electricity from Tongyu to Jilin Grid was completed. In 2016, another project of a 583 km new 550-KV transmission line began construction. In addition, in 2016, the NDRC approved an 800-kV UHV transmission project to transmit electricity from Northeast region to Shandong province in North China region. The project was set to be completed by the end of 2017.
4.2.2.2. System balance. The system balance problem has not been well considered in the planning of Jilin's wind energy development. Furthermore, since the proportion of combined heat and power (CHP) units has been very high in Jilin, the capacity of coal-fired power plants to balance wind power generation output is rather limited. As shown in Fig. 7a, while hydro power units accounted for 14.4% of total capacity in 2015, only 3% of these units could be used for system balance. Thermal power units accounted for 68.3% of total power capacity in Jilin Province; however, 74% of them was CHP units.5 Existing coal- based CHP units were not able to be dispatched as peaking units due to their inflexibility and mandatory operation during the long winter from the end of October to early April. During this period, wind power curtailment was very common, and the highest curtailment rate reached 45% in February (shown in Fig. 7b).6
4.2.2.3. Oversupply. With economic deceleration in Jilin province, the issue of oversupply in the power sector first appeared in 2010, and deteriorated thereafter. To a great extent, the power supply overcapacity was the result of mismatch between the province plan and the national plan. In 2011, the NEA set up a 6 GW by 2015 target for Jilin province in the 12th FYP for Wind Power Development, while the target adopted by Jilin was 14.6 GW. Due to the local government's expedition on wind power project approval, the capacity for grid- connected and under-construction wind power projects already exceeded 6 GW in 2012, which was NEA's 2015 target. In response to this rapid development, the NEA had not approved any new wind power project to Jilin province since 2013 [54].
The overcapacity problem also reflects the lack of coordination between the heating and power sectors. In 2015, the installed electricity generation capacity in Jilin province was 26.1 GW (Fig. 8), of which 13.2 GW were inflexible CHP units. Both of these exceeded Jilin grid's maximum electricity load of 10.7 GW.
4.2.2.4. Demandside. ThegrowthrateofannualelectricitydemandinJilin province was only 2.5% during the 12th FYP period, far below the provincial government's optimistic prediction of 14.7%.7 In 2015, the growth rate became negative and was −2.4% (Fig. 9). Meanwhile, electricity demand in Liaoning province—the load center of the Northeast China—decelerated significantly. Its overall growth rate of only 3% in the 12th FYP period. The growth rate also became negative in 2015. As a result, exported electricity from Jilin Province had dropped accordingly since 2014 (Fig. 9).
4.3. Comparison of the two cases
The above two cases share several common regulatory problems:
(1) Fragmented authority on power project approval
Vertically, the mismatch of provincial plan and national plan was the major reason for local oversupply and transmission constraint before 2011. In Jiuquan's case, the installed capacity in the first phase was one third more than originally planned, whereas in Jilin's case, the provincial target for the 12th FYP period was 2.2 times of the target set up by the central government. Only after July 2011, when NEA included new wind projects into the annual national wind power plan, were the provincial planning and national planning co- ordinated. Furthermore, horizontally, wind power planning failed to consider generation from other sources, system balancing needs, and heating demand during winters. Both the vertical and horizontal mismatches reflect the underlying fragmented authority on power project approval. This causes sector-wise oversupply and insufficient system balancing resources, and ultimately wind curtailment.
(2) Incoordination between wind power and transmission capacity Lacking a unified grid planning in the 12th FYP period, the ap- proval and construction of trans-regional transmission lines lagged far behind that of wind power generation projects. For example, the State Grid company planned the UHV trans-regional transmission line for Gansu in 2010. However, this line was only approved by NDRC in 2015 and effective to use in 2017. By that time, the power importing area faced its own oversupply problem. Similarly, for Tongyu in Jilin, it took three years for NDRC to approve the transmission project application, 15 months to coordinate with other counties, and another two more years to finish the construc- tion work. This severely lagged behind wind energy development, resulting in the first wave of wind curtailment.
(3) Province-dominated generation dispatching and decision-making Power plants generation dispatching and energy decision-making is currently province-dominated, thus creating high inter-provincial barriers for electricity transactions that tend to protect local eco- nomic interests. In Gansu's case, due to the delayed approval of the 800 kV transmission project, the recipient provinces built their own coal-fired power plants, and thus became less willing to import electricity from Gansu. In Jilin's case, the regional load center itself experienced a negative electricity demand growth in 2015, and then largely decreased its wind power imports from Jilin.
The current generation dispatching and energy decision-making only produced sub-optimal results nationwide and the decelerated electricity demand growth is likely to make the situation even worse.
5. Conclusions and policy recommendations
This paper built upon the theory of “fragmented authoritarianism” and developed an electricity regulatory framework to explain the institutional causes of wind curtailment in China. We show that frag- mentation in the electric power regulation exists at both the vertical and horizontal levels. At the vertical level, power regulatory authority is assigned to the central government and 32 provincial governments. While the central government makes national policies, provinces decide power generation and allocation within their jurisdictions. At the hor- izontal level, regulation responsibilities are scattered among different ministries or departments of each administrative level. Decision-making authority is even fragmented within one ministry or department. Moreover, state-owned grid companies and generation companies have strong bargaining power under such a system. The fragmented power and responsibilities at both central and local governments lead to de- partmentalism and coordination problems.
Electricity regulatory fragmentation affects power planning and inter-provincial power transaction. The planning authority is assigned to different government departments and state-owned enterprises, which results in various mismatches of planning both at the vertical level and the horizontal level. This in turn has led to transmission constraints, system imbalance, as well as overcapacity for wind curtailment. Furthermore, the independent provincial electric power regulation and decision-making create serious inter-provincial barriers on power trans- action. Such an institutional arrangement limits power generation and allocation within one province, resulting in sub-optimal wind integra- tion. This is especially detrimental for provinces with national wind power bases. During economic deceleration, inter-provincial barriers also make receiving provinces less willing to take electricity from other pro- vinces, especially when their own power generation is in oversupply.
China has taken a series of measures to address the wind curtailment issue. As mentioned before, starting in 2011, a unified national annual plan on wind power development helped to fix the problem of fragmented authority on wind project approval. In October 2014, a pilot program was launched in the Northeast to pay coal-fired power plants for providing peak regulation services for wind power. In 2016, a unified five-year plan for the whole power sector was issued by NDRC and NEA, putting an end to the fragmented planning in various power sources. However, inter- provincial barriers caused by scattered provincial electric power regula- tion remains unsolved. Furthermore, the separate operation of electricity, heating, and transport sectors leaves enormous unutilized potential to integrate more intermittent renewable energy on the table [55].
The most important policy implication of this paper is to establish re- gional spot power markets, which aim to break the inter-provincial barriers and to achieve broader power system optimization. A regional spot power market in China is a short-term power trade deal that is settled with a short delivery time. According to the official definition, spot market products can be day-ahead products or intra-day products, either hourly, half-hourly or real-time products. To obtain support from local governments, this paper suggests establishing regional market for spot products and leaving pro- vincial markets to local governments for medium and long-term trade.
First, this paper suggests establishing six regional spot power mar- kets based on current regional grid divisions. The six regional spot markets include: South China market, East China market, Central China market, North China market, Northeast market and Northwest market. NEA and NDRC should take the lead in this mission. To get support from local governments, provincial electricity markets’ function of balancing provincial power units should be kept. Regional grid en- terprises should be responsible for building power trade platforms, trade organizations, and dispatch centers.
Second, this paper recommends introducing spot products and fa- cilitate renewable energy's participation in market competition. Flexible mechanisms on trade declaration, forecasting, and updating for renewable energy should be provided by regional trade organizations. Meanwhile, NEA and NDRC should require renewable energy compa- nies to provide basic system balance service for other generation units. At the early stage, regional spot market should be responsible for the trade of incremental wind power and other power [56].
Third, this paper advocates constructing a unified regional spot trading system. The regional trade organization should enact interface standards to interconnect regional and provincial trade platforms. Both intra-provincial and inter-provincial spot transaction service shall be provided simultaneously. NEA and NDRC should provide incentives to encourage market players to increase transaction volumes in the re- gional market. Meanwhile, a clear timetable for the gradual exit of planned electricity generation and allocation administration should be formulated by NEA and NDRC. Ultimately, all spot transactions should be reached in the regional markets, while medium-to-long-term for- ward markets can be maintained in provincial market.
In the long term, China should proceed with its power market re- form, and build a renewable energy-friendly power market equipped with inter-provincial power exchange and auxiliary service trading platforms. Meanwhile, merging the electricity, heating, and transport sectors could further increase the renewable energy penetration rate."
